            TRILL: Pseudo-Nickname for Active-Active Access 
              draft-ietf-trill-pseudonode-nickname-07.txt


Abstract

   The IETF TRILL (TRansparent Interconnection of Lots of Links)
   protocol provides support for flow level multi-pathing for both
   unicast and multi-destination traffic in networks with arbitrary
   topology. Active-active access at the TRILL edge is the extension of
   these characteristics to end stations that are multiply connected to
   a TRILL campus as discussed in RFC 7379. In this document, the edge
   RBridge (TRILL switch) group providing active-active access to such
   an end station are represented as a Virtual RBridge. Based on the
   concept of Virtual RBridge along with its pseudo-nickname, this
   document specifies a method for TRILL active-active access by such
   end stations.

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


1. Introduction

   The IETF TRILL protocol [RFC6325] provides optimal pair-wise data
   frame forwarding without configuration, safe forwarding even during
   periods of temporary loops, and support for multi-pathing of both
   unicast and multicast traffic. TRILL accomplishes this by using IS-IS
   [IS-IS] [RFC7176] link state routing and encapsulating traffic using
   a header that includes a hop count.  Devices that implement TRILL are
   called RBridges or TRILL switches.

   In the base TRILL protocol, an end node can be attached to the TRILL
   campus via a point-to-point link or a shared link such as a bridged
   LAN (Local Area Network). Although there might be more than one edge
   RBridge on a shared link, to avoid potential forwarding loops, one
   and only one of the edge RBridges is permitted to provide forwarding
   service for end station traffic in each VLAN (Virtual LAN). That
   RBridge is referred to as the Appointed Forwarder (AF) for that VLAN
   on the link [RFC6325] [RFC6439]. However, in some practical
   deployments, to increase the access bandwidth and reliability, an end
   station might be multiply connected to several edge RBridges and all
   of the uplinks are handled via a Local Active-Active Link Protocol
   (LAALP [RFC7379]) such as Multi-Chassis Link Aggregation (MC-LAG) or
   Distributed Resilient Network Interconnect (DRNI [802.1AX]). In this
   case, it's required that traffic can be ingressed/egressed into/from
   the TRILL campus by any of the RBridges for each given VLAN. These
   RBridges constitutes an Active-Active Edge (AAE) RBridge group.

   With an LAALP, traffic with the same VLAN and source MAC address but
   belonging to different flows will frequently be sent to different
   member RBridges of the AAE group and then ingressed into TRILL
   campus. When an egress RBridge receives such TRILL data packets
   ingressed by different RBridges, it learns different VLAN and MAC
   address to nickname correspondences continuously when decapsulating
   the packets if it has data plane address learning enabled. This issue
   is known as the "MAC flip-flopping" issue, which makes most TRILL
   switches behave badly and causes the returning traffic to reach the
   destination via different paths resulting in persistent re-ordering
   of the frames. In addition to this issue, other issues such as
   duplicate egressing and loop back of multi-destination frames may
   also disturb an end station multiply connected to the member RBridges
   of an AAE group [RFC7379].

   This document addresses the AAE issues of TRILL by specifying how
   members of an edge RBridge group can be represented by a Virtual
   RBridge (RBv) and assigned a pseudo-nickname. A member RBridge of
   such a group uses a pseudo-nickname, instead of its own nickname, as
   the ingress RBridge nickname when ingressing frames received on
   attached LAALP links. Other methods are possible: for example the
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                  [Page 4]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   specification in this document and the specification in [MultiAttach]
   could be simultaneously deployed for different AAE groups in the same
   campus. If the method is [MultiAttach] is used, edge TRILL switches
   need to support the capability indicated by the Capability Flags
   APPsub-TLV as specified in Section 4.2 of [MultiAttach]. If the
   method defined in this document is adopted, all TRILL switches need
   to support the Affinity sub-TLV defined in [RFC7176] and [CMT]. For a
   TRILL campus that deploys both these AAE methods, TRILL switches are
   required to support both methods. However, it is desirable to only
   adopt one method in a TRILL campus so that the operating expense,
   complexity of troubleshooting, etc, can be reduced. 

   The main body of this document is organized as follows: Section 2
   gives an overview of the TRILL active-active access issues and the
   reason that a virtual RBridge (RBv) is used to resolve the issues.
   Section 3 gives the concept of a virtual RBridge (RBv) and its
   pseudo-nickname. Section 4 describes how edge RBridges can support an
   RBv automatically and get a pseudo-nickname for the RBv. Section 5
   discusses how to protect multi-destination traffic against disruption
   due to Reverse Forwarding Path (RPF) check failure, duplication,
   forwarding loops, etc. Section 6 covers the special processing of
   native frames and TRILL data packets at member RBridges of an RBv
   (also referred to as an Active-Active Edge (AAE) RBridge group).
   Section 7 describes the MAC information synchronization among the
   member RBridges of an RBv. Section 8 discusses protection against
   downlink failure at a member RBridge; and Section 9 gives the
   necessary TRILL code points and data structures for a pseudo-nickname
   AAE RBridge group.


1.1. Terminology and Acronyms

   This document uses the acronyms and terms defined in [RFC6325] and
   [RFC7379] and the following additional acronyms:

   AAE - Active-active Edge RBridge group, a group of edge RBridges to
   which at least one CE is multiply attached with an LAALP. AAE is also
   referred to as edge group or Virtual RBridge in this document.

   Campus - A TRILL network consisting of TRILL switches, links, and
   possibly bridges bounded by end stations and IP routers. For TRILL,
   there is no "academic" implication in the name "campus".

   CE - Customer Equipment (end station or bridge). The device can be
   either physical or virtual equipment.

   Data Label - VLAN or FGL.

   DF - Designated Forwarder.

   DRNI: Distributed Resilient Network Interconnect. A link aggregation
   specified in [802.1AX] that can provide an LAALP between from 1 to 3
   CEs and 2 or 3 RBridges.

   E-L1FS - Extended Level 1 Flooding Scope [RFC7356].

   FGL - Fine-Grained Labeling or Fine-Grained Labeled or Fine-Grained
   Label [RFC7172].

   DRNI.

   MC-LAG: Multi-Chassis LAG. Proprietary extensions of Link Aggregation
   [802.1AX] that can provide an LAALP between one CE and 2 or more
   RBridges.

   OE flag - A flag used by the member RBridge of an LAALP to tell other
   edge RBridges whether it is willing to share an RBv with other LAALPs
   if they multiply attach to the same set of edge RBridges as it. When
   this flag for an LAALP is 1, it means that the LAALP needs to be
   served by an RBv by itself and is not willing to share, that is, it
   should Occupy an RBv Exclusively (OE).

   RBv - virtual RBridge, an alias for active-active edge RBridge group
   in this document.

   vDRB - The Designated RBridge in an RBv. It is responsible for
   deciding the pseudo-nickname for the RBv.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2. Overview

   To minimize impact during failures and maximize available access
   bandwidth, Customer Equipment (referred to as CE in this document)
   may be multiply connected to TRILL campus via multiple edge
   RBridges.

   Figure 1 shows such a typical deployment scenario, where CE1 attaches
   to RB1, RB2, ... RBk and treats all of the uplinks as an LAALP
   bundle. Then RB1, RB2, ... RBk constitute an Active-active Edge (AAE)
   RBridge group for CE1 in this LAALP. Even if a member RBridge or an
   uplink fails, CE1 will still get frame forwarding service from the

   TRILL campus if there are still member RBridges and uplinks available
   in the AAE group. Furthermore, CE1 can make flow-based load balancing
   across the available member links of the LAALP bundle in the AAE
   group when it communicates with other CEs across the TRILL campus
   [RFC7379].

        Figure 1  Active-Active Connection to TRILL Edge RBridges       

   By design, an LAALP (say LAALP1) does not forward packets received on
   one member port to other member ports. As a result, the TRILL Hello
   messages sent by one member RBridge (say RB1) via a port to CE1 will
   not be forwarded to other member RBridges by CE1. That is to say,
   member RBridges will not see each other's Hellos via the LAALP. So
   every member RBridge of LAALP1 thinks of itself as appointed
   forwarder for all VLANs enabled on an LAALP1 link and can
   ingress/egress frames simultaneously in these VLANs [RFC6439]. 

   The simultaneous flow-based ingressing/egressing can cause some
   problems. For example, simultaneous egressing of multi-destination
   traffic by multiple member RBridges will result in frame duplication
   at CE1 (see Section 3.1 of [RFC7379]); simultaneous ingressing of
   frames originated by CE1 for different flows in the same VLAN with
   the same source MAC address will result in MAC address flip-flopping
   at remote egress RBridges that have data plane address learning
   enabled (see Section 3.3 of [RFC7379]). The flip-flopping would in
   turn cause packet re-ordering in reverse traffic.

 


H. Zhai, et al                                                  [Page 7]

   Edge RBridges learn Data Label and MAC address to nickname
   correspondences by default via decapsulating TRILL data packets (see
   Section 4.8.1 of [RFC6325] as updated by [RFC7172]). Assuming that
   the default data-plane learning is enabled at edge RBridges, MAC
   flip-flopping can be solved by using a Virtual RBridge together with
   its pseudo-nickname. This document specifies a way to do so.


3. Virtual RBridge and its Pseudo-nickname

   A Virtual RBridge (RBv) represents a group of edge RBridges to which
   at least one CE is multiply attached using an LAALP. More exactly, it
   represents a group of ports on the edge RBridges providing end
   station service and the service provided to the CE(s) on these ports,
   through which the CE(s) are multiply attached to the TRILL campus
   using LAALP(s). Such end station service ports are called RBv ports;
   in contrast, other access ports at edge RBridges are called regular
   access ports in this document. RBv ports are always LAALP connecting
   ports, but not vice versa (see Section 4.1). For an edge RBridge, if
   one or more of its end station service ports are ports of an RBv,
   that RBridge is a member RBridge of that RBv.

   For the convenience of description, a Virtual RBridge is also
   referred to as an Active-Active Edge (AAE) group in this document. In
   the TRILL campus, an RBv is identified by its pseudo-nickname, which
   is different from any RBridge's regular nickname(s). An RBv has one
   and only one pseudo-nickname. Each member RBridge (say RB1, RB2 ...,
   RBk) of an RBv (say RBvn) advertises RBvn's pseudo-nickname using a
   Nickname sub-TLV in its TRILL IS-IS LSP (Link State PDU) [RFC7176]
   and SHOULD do so with maximum priority of use (0xFF), along with
   their regular nickname(s). (Maximum priority is recommended to avoid
   the disruption to an AAE group that would occur if the nickname were
   taken away by a higher priority RBridge.) Then, from these LSPs,
   other RBridges outside the AAE group know that RBvn is reachable
   through RB1 to RBk.

   A member RBridge (say RBi) loses its membership in RBvn when its last
   port in RBvn becomes unavailable due to failure, re-configuration,
   etc. Then RBi removes RBvn's pseudo-nickname from its LSP and
   distributes the updated LSP as usual. From those updated LSPs, other
   RBridges know that there is no path to RBvn through RBi now.

   When member RBridges receive native frames on their RBv ports and
   decide to ingress the frames into the TRILL campus, they use that
   RBv's pseudo-nickname instead of their own regular nicknames as the
   ingress nickname to encapsulate them into TRILL Data packets. So when
   these packets arrive at an egress RBridge, even if they are
   originated by the same end station in the same VLAN but ingressed by
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                  [Page 8]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   different member RBridges, no address flip-flopping is observed on
   the egress RBridge when decapsulating these packets. (When a member
   RBridge of an AAE group ingresses a frame from a non-RBv port, it
   still uses its own regular nickname as the ingress nickname.)

   Since RBv is not a physical node and no TRILL frames are forwarded
   between its ports via an LAALP, pseudo-node LSP(s) MUST NOT be
   created for an RBv. RBv cannot act as a root when constructing
   distribution trees for multi-destination traffic and its pseudo-
   nickname is ignored when determining the distribution tree root for
   TRILL campus [CMT]. So the tree root priority of RBv's nickname MUST
   be set to 0, and this nickname MUST NOT be listed in the "s"
   nicknames (see Section 4.5 of [RFC6325]) by the RBridge holding the
   highest priority tree root nickname.

   NOTE: In order to reduce the consumption of nicknames, especially in
   large TRILL campus with lots of RBridges and/or active-active
   accesses, when multiple CEs attach to the exact same set of edge
   RBridges via LAALPs, those edge RBridges should be considered as a
   single RBv with a single pseudo-nickname.


4. Member RBridges Auto-Discovery

   Edge RBridges connected to a CE via an LAALP can automatically
   discover each other with minimal configuration through exchange of
   LAALP connection information.

   From the perspective of edge RBridges, a CE that connects to edge
   RBridges via an LAALP can be identified by the ID of the LAALP that
   is unique across the TRILL campus (for example, the MC-LAG or DRNI
   System ID [802.1AX]), which is referred to as an LAALP ID in this
   document. On each of such edge RBridges, the access port to such a CE
   is associated with an LAALP ID for the CE. An LAALP is considered
   valid on an edge RBridge only if the RBridge still has an operational
   downlink to that LAALP. For such an edge RBridge, it advertises a
   list of LAALP IDs for its valid local LAALPs to other edge RBridges
   via its E-L1FS FS-LSP(s) [RFC7356][rfc7180bis]. Based on the LAALP
   IDs advertised by other RBridges, each RBridge can know which edge
   RBridges could constitute an AAE group (See Section 4.1 for more
   details). Then one RBridge is elected from the group to allocate an
   available nickname (the pseudo-nickname) for the group (See Section
   4.2 for more details).

4.1. Discovering Member RBridge for an RBv

   RB1 and RB2 advertise {LAALP1, LAALP2} in the PN-LAALP-Membership
   sub-TLV (see Section 9.1 for more details) via their TRILL E-L1FS
   LSPs respectively; RB3 announces {LAALP1, LAALP2, LAALP3, LAALP4};
   and RB4 announces {LAALP3, LAALP4}, respectively.

   An edge RBridge is called an LAALP related RBridge if it has at least
   one LAALP configured on an access port. On receipt of the PN-LAALP-
   Membership sub-TLVs, RBn ignores them if it is not an LAALP related
   RBridge; otherwise, RBn SHOULD use the LAALP information contained in
   the sub-TLVs, along with its own PN-LAALP-Membership sub-TLVs to
   decide which RBv(s) it should join and which edge RBridges constitute
   each of such RBvs. Based on the information received, each of the 4
   RBridges knows the following information:

              LAALP ID    OE-flag    Set of edge RBridges
              ---------   --------   ---------------------

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   RBv with other LAALPs if they multiply attach to exact the same set
   of edge RBridges as it. For an LAALP (for example LAALP3), if its OE-
   flag is one, it means that LAALP3 does not want to share, so it MUST
   Occupy an RBv Exclusively (OE). Support of OE is optional. RBridges
   that do not support OE ignore the OE bit and act as if it was zero
   (see Section 11 on Configuration Consistency).

   Otherwise, the LAALP (for example LAALP1) will share an RBv with
   other LAALPs if possible. By default, this flag is set to zero. For
   an LAALP, this flag is considered 1 if any edge RBridge advertises it
   as one (see Section 9.1). 

   In the above table, there might be some LAALPs that attach to a
   single RBridge due to mis-configuration or link failure, etc. Those
   LAALPs are considered as invalid entries. Then each of the LAALP
   related edge RBridges performs the following algorithm to decide
   which valid LAALPs can be served by an RBv.

      Step 1: Take all the valid LAALPs that have their OE-flags set to
      1 out of the table and create an RBv per such LAALP.

      Step 2: Sort the valid LAALPs left in the table in descending
      order based on the number of RBridges in their associated set of
      multi-homed RBridges. In the case that several LAALPs have same
      number of RBridges, these LAALPs are then ordered in ascending
      order in the proper places of the table based on their LAALP IDs
      considered as unsigned integers. (for example, in the above table,
      both LAALP1 and LAALP2 have 3 member RBridges, assuming LAALP1 ID
      is smaller than LAALP2 ID, so LAALP1 is followed by LAALP2 in the
      ordered table.)

      Step 3: Take the first valid LAALP (say LAALP_i) with the maximum
      set of RBridges, say S_i, out of the table and create a new RBv
      (Say RBv_i) for it.

      Step 4: Walk through the remaining valid LAALPs in the table one
      by one, pick up all the valid LAALPs that have their sets of
      multi-homed RBridges contain exactly the same RBridges as that of
      LAALP_i and take them out of the table.  Then appoint RBv_i as the
      servicing RBv for those LAALPs.

      Step 5: Repeat Step 3-4 for any LAALPs left until all the valid
      entries in the table are associated with an RBv.

   After performing the above steps, all the 4 RBridges know that LAALP3
   is served by an RBv, say RBv1, which has RB3 and RB4 as member
   RBridges; LAALP1 and LAALP2 are served by another RBv, say RBv2,
   which has RB1, RB2 and RB3 as member RBridges; and LAALP4 is served

   by RBv3, which has RB3 and RB4 as member RBridges, shown as follows:

         RBv    Serving LAALPs       Member RBridges
         -----  -------------------  ---------------
         RBv1   {LAALP3}             {RB3, RB4}
         RBv2   {LAALP1, LAALP2}     {RB1, RB2, RB3}
         RBv3   {LAALP4}             {RB3, RB4}

   In each RBv, one of the member RBridges is elected as the vDRB
   (Designated RBridge) of the RBv. Then this RBridge picks up an
   available nickname as the pseudo-nickname for the RBv and announces
   it to all other member RBridges of the RBv via its TRILL E-L1FS LSPs
   (refer to Section 9.2 for the relative extended sub-TLVs).

4.2. Selection of Pseudo-nickname for RBv

   As described in Section 3, in the TRILL campus, an RBv is identified
   by its pseudo-nickname. In an AAE group, one member RBridge is
   elected for the duty to select a pseudo-nickname for this RBv; this
   RBridge is called Designated RBridge of the RBv (vDRB) in this
   document. The winner is the RBridge with the largest IS-IS System ID
   considered as an unsigned integer, in the group. Then based on its
   TRILL IS-IS link state database and the potential pseudo-nickname(s)
   reported in the PN-LAALP-Membership sub-TLVs by other member RBridges
   of this RBv (see Section 9.1 for more details), the vDRB selects an
   available nickname as the pseudo-nickname for this RBv and advertises
   it to the other RBridges via its E-L1FS FS-LSP(s) (see Section 9.2
   and [rfc7180bis]). Except as provided below, the selection of a
   nickname to use as the pseudo-nickname follows the usual TRILL rules
   given in [RFC6325] as updated by [rfc7180bis].

   To reduce the traffic disruption caused by nickname changing, if
   possible, vDRB SHOULD attempt to reuse the pseudo-nickname recently
   used by the group when selecting nickname for the RBv. To help the
   vDRB to do so, each LAALP related RBridge advertises a re-using
   pseudo-nickname for each of its LAALPs in its LAALP Membership sub-
   TLV if it has used such a pseudo-nickname for that LAALP recently.
   Although it is up to the implementation of the vDRB as to how to
   treat the re-using pseudo-nicknames, the following is RECOMMENDED:

   o  If there are multiple available re-using pseudo-nicknames that are
      reported by all the member RBridges of some LAALPs in this RBv,
      the available one that is reported by the largest number of such
      LAALPs is chosen as the pseudo-nickname for this RBv. If a tie
      exists, the re-using pseudo-nickname with the smallest value
      considered as an unsigned integer is chosen.

   o  If only one re-using pseudo-nickname is reported, it SHOULD be

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


      chosen if available.

   If there is no available re-using pseudo-nickname reported, the vDRB
   selects a nickname by its usual method.

   Then the selected pseudo-nickname is announced by the vDRB to other
   member RBridges of this RBv in the PN-RBv sub-TLV (see Section 9.2). 

5. Distribution Trees and Designated Forwarder

   In an AAE group, as each of the member RBridges thinks it is the
   appointed forwarder for VLAN x, without changes made for active-
   active connection support, they would all ingress/egress frames
   into/from TRILL campus for all VLANs. For multi-destination frames,
   more than one member RBridges ingressing them may cause some of the
   resulting TRILL Data packets to be discarded due to failure of
   Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) Check on other RBridges; for a multi-
   destination traffic, more than one RBridges egressing it may cause
   local CE(s) receiving duplication frame. Furthermore, in an AAE
   group, a multi-destination frame sent by a CE (say CEi) may be
   ingressed into TRILL campus by one member RBridge, then another
   member RBridge will receive it from TRILL campus and egress it to
   CEi, which will result in loop back of frame for CEi. These problems
   are all described in [RFC7379].

   In the following sub-sections, the first two issues are discussed in
   Section 5.1 and Section 5.2, respectively; the third one is discussed
   in Section 5.3.

5.1. Different Trees for Different Member RBridges

   In TRILL, RBridges normally use distribution trees to forward multi-
   destination frames. (Under some circumstances they can be unicast as
   specified in [RFC7172].) An RPF Check along with other checking is
   used to avoid temporary multicast loops during topology changes
   (Section 4.5.2 of [RFC6325]). The RPF Check mechanism only accepts a
   multi-destination frame ingressed by an RBridge RBi and forwarded on
   a distribution tree if it arrives at another RBridge RBn on the
   expected port. If arriving on any other port, the frame MUST be
   dropped.

   To avoid address flip-flopping on remote RBridges, member RBridges
   use RBv's pseudo-nickname instead of their regular nicknames as
   ingress nickname to ingress native frames, including multi-
   destination frames. From the view of other RBridges, these frames
   appear as if they were ingressed by the RBv. When multi-destination
   frames of different flows are ingressed by different member RBridges
   of an RBv and forwarded along the same distribution tree, they may
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 13]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   arrive at RBn on different ports. Some of them will violate the RPF
   Check principle at RBn and be dropped, which will result in lost
   traffic.

   In an RBv, if different member RBridge uses different distribution
   trees to ingress multi-destination frames, the RPF Check violation
   issue can be fixed. Coordinated Multicast Trees (CMT) [CMT] proposes
   such an approach, and makes use of the Affinity sub-TLV defined in
   [RFC7176] to tell other RBridges which trees a member RBridge (say
   RBi) may choose when ingressing multi-destination frames; then all
   RBridges in the TRILL campus can calculate RPF Check information for
   RBi on those trees taking the tree affinity information into account
   [CMT].

   This document uses the approach proposed in [CMT] to fix the RPF
   Check violation issue. Please refer to [CMT] for more details of the
   approach.

5.2. Designated Forwarder for Member RBridges

   Take Figure 3 as an example, where CE1 and CE2 are served by an RBv
   that has RB1 and RB2 as member RBridges. In VLAN x, the three CEs can
   communicate with each other.

       Figure 3  A Topology with Multi-homed and Single-homed CEs       

   When a remote RBridge (say RBn) sends a multi-destination TRILL Data
   packet in VLAN x (or the FGL that VLAN x maps to if the packet is
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 14]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   FGL), both RB1 and RB2 will receive it. As each of them thinks it is
   the appointed forwarder for VLAN x, without changes made for active-
   active connection support, they would both forward the frame to
   CE1/CE2. As a result, CE1/CE2 would receive duplicate copies of the
   frame through this RBv.

   In another case, assume CE3 is single-homed to RB2. When it transmits
   a native multi-destination frame onto link CE3-RB2 in VLAN x, the
   frame can be locally replicated to the ports to CE1/CE2, and also
   encapsulated into TRILL Data packet and ingressed into TRILL campus.
   When the packet arrives at RB1 across the TRILL campus, it will be
   egressed to CE1/CE2 by RB1. Then CE1/CE2 receives duplicate copies
   from RB1 and RB2.

   In this document, the Designated Forwarder (DF) for a VLAN is
   introduced to avoid the duplicate copies. The basic idea of the DF is
   to elect one RBridge per VLAN from an RBv to egress multi-destination
   TRILL Data traffic and replicate locally-received multi-destination
   native frames to the CEs served by the RBv.

   Note that the DF has an effect only on the egressing/replicating of
   multi-destination traffic. It has no effect on the ingressing,
   forwarding, or egressing of unicast frames. Furthermore, the DF check
   is performed only for RBv ports, not on regular access ports.

   Each RBridge in an RBv elects a DF using the same algorithm which
   guarantees the same RBridge elected as DF per VLAN by all members of
   the RBv.

   Assuming there are m LAALPs and k member RBridges in an RBv; each
   LAALP is referred to as LAALPi where 0 <= i < m, and each RBridge is
   referred to as RBj where 0 <= j < k, the DF election algorithm per
   VLAN is as follows:

      Step 1: For LAALPi, sort all the RBridges in numerically ascending
      order based on SHA-256(System IDj | LAALP IDi) considered as an
      unsigned intger, where SHA-256 is the hash function in [RFC6234],
      "System IDj" is the 6-byte IS-IS System ID of RBj, "|" means
      concatenation, and LAALP IDi is the LAALP ID for LAALPi. System ID
      and LAALP ID are considered as byte strings. In the case of a tie,
      the tied RBridges are sorted in numerically ascending order by
      their System IDs considered as unsigned integers.

      Step 2: Each RBridge in the numerically sorted list is assigned a
      monotonically increasing number j, such that increasing number j
      corresponds to its position in the sorted list, i.e., the first
      RBridge (the one with the smallest SHA-256(System ID | LAALP ID))
      is assigned zero and the last is assigned k-1.
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 15]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


      Step 3: For each VLAN ID n, choose the RBridge whose number equals
      (n mod k) as the DF.

      Step 4: Repeat Step 1-3 for the remaining LAALPs until there is a
      DF per VLAN per LAALP in the RBv.

   For a multi-destination native frame of VLAN x received, if RBi is an
   LAALP attached RBridge, there are three cases where RBi replicates
   the multi-destination frame, as follows:

      1) Local replication of the frame to regular (non-AAE) access
         ports as per [RFC6325] (and [RFC7172] for FGL).

      2) RBv ports associated with the same pseudo-nickname as that of
         the incoming port, no matter whether RBi is the DF for the
         frame's VLAN on the outgoing ports except that the frame MUST
         NOT be replicated back to the incoming port. RBi cannot simply
         depend on the DF to forward the multi-destination frame back
         into the AAEs associated with pseudo-nickname as that would
         cause the source CE to get the frame back, which is a violation
         of basic Ethernet properties. The DF will not forward such a
         frame back into the AAE due to ingress nickname filtering as
         described in Section 5.3.

      3) RBv ports on which RBi is the DF for the frame's VLAN while
         they are associated with different pseudo-nickname(s) to that
         of the incoming port.

   For a multi-destination TRILL Data packet received, RBi MUST NOT
   egress it out of the RBv ports where it is not DF for the frame's
   Inner.VLAN (or for the VLAN corresponding to the Inner.Label if the
   packet is an FGL one). Otherwise, whether or not egressing it out of
   such ports is further subject to the filtering check result of the
   frame's ingress nickname on these ports (see Section 5.3).

5.3. Ingress Nickname Filtering

   As shown in Figure 3, CE1 may send multi-destination traffic in VLAN
   x to TRILL campus via a member RBridge (say RB1). The traffic is then
   TRILL-encapsulated by RB1 and delivered through the TRILL campus to
   multi-destination receivers. RB2 may receive the traffic, and egress
   it back to CE1 if it is the DF for VLAN x on the port to LAALP1. Then
   the traffic loops back to CE1 (see Section 3.2 of [RFC7379).

   To fix the above issue, an ingress nickname filtering check is
   required by this document. The idea is to check the ingress nickname
   of a multi-destination TRILL Data packet before egressing a copy of
   it out of an RBv port. If the ingress nickname matches the pseudo-
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 16]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   nickname of the RBv (associated with the port), the filtering check
   should fail and the copy MUST NOT be egressed out of that RBv port.
   Otherwise, the copy is egressed out of that port if it has also
   passed other checks, such as the appointed forwarder check in Section
   4.6.2.5 of [RFC6325] and the DF check in Section 5.2.

   Note that this ingress nickname filtering check has no effect on the
   multi-destination native frames received on access ports and
   replicated to other local ports (including RBv ports), since there is
   no ingress nickname associated with such frames. Furthermore, for the
   RBridge regular access ports, there is no pseudo-nickname associated
   with them; so no ingress nickname filtering check is required on
   those ports.

   More details of data packet processing on RBv ports are given in the
   next section.


6. TRILL Traffic Processing

   This section provides more details of native frame and TRILL Data
   packet processing as it relates to the RBv's pseudo-nickname.

6.1. Native Frames Ingressing

   When RB1 receives a unicast native frame from one of its ports that
   has end-station service enabled, it processes the frame as described
   in Section 4.6.1.1 of [RFC6325] with the following exception.

   o  If the port is an RBv port, RB1 uses the RBv's pseudo-nickname,
      instead of one of its regular nickname(s) as the ingress nickname
      when doing TRILL encapsulation on the frame.

   When RB1 receives a native multi-destination (Broadcast, Unknown
   unicast or Multicast) frame from one of its access ports (including
   regular access ports and RBv ports), it processes the frame as
   described in Section 4.6.1.2 of [RFC6325] with the following
   exceptions.

   o  If the incoming port is an RBv port, RB1 uses the RBv's pseudo-
      nickname, instead of one of its regular nickname(s) as the ingress
      nickname when doing TRILL encapsulation on the frame.

   o  For the copies of the frame replicated locally to RBv ports, there
      are two cases as follows:

         LAALP as the incoming port, the copies are forwarded out of
         that outgoing port(s) after passing the appointed forwarder
         check for the frame's VLAN. That is to say, the copies are
         processed on such port(s) as Section 4.6.1.2 of [RFC6325].

      -  Else, the Designated Forwarder (DF) check is also made on the
         outgoing ports for the frame's VLAN after the appointed
         forwarder check. The copies are not output through the ports
         that failed the DF check (i.e., RB1 is not DF for the frame's
         VLAN on the ports); otherwise, the copies are forwarded out of
         the ports that pass the DF check (see Section 5.2).

   For such a frame received, the MAC address information learned by
   observing it, together with the LAALP ID of the incoming port SHOULD
   be shared with other member RBridges in the group (see Section 7).

6.2. Egressing TRILL Data Packets

   This section describes egress processing of the TRILL Data packets
   received on an RBv member RBridge (say RBn). Section 6.2.1 describes
   the egress processing of unicast TRILL Data packets and Section 6.2.2
   specifies the multi-destination TRILL Data packets egressing.

6.2.1. Unicast TRILL Data Packets

   When receiving a unicast TRILL data packet, RBn checks the egress
   nickname in the TRILL header of the packet.  If the egress nickname
   is one of RBn's regular nicknames, the packet is processed as defined
   in Section 4.6.2.4 of [RFC6325].

   If the egress nickname is the pseudo-nickname of a local RBv, RBn is
   responsible for learning the source MAC address, unless data plane
   learning has been disabled. The learned {Inner.MacSA, Data Label,
   ingress nickname} triplet SHOULD be shared within the AAE group as
   described in Section 7.

   Then the packet is de-capsulated to its native form. The Inner.MacDA
   and Data Label are looked up in RBn's local forwarding tables, and
   one of the three following cases will occur. RBn uses the first case
   that applies and ignores the remaining cases:

   o  If the destination end station identified by the Inner.MacDA and
      Data Label is on a local link, the native frame is sent onto that
      link with the VLAN from the Inner.VLAN or VLAN corresponding to
      the Inner.Label if the packet is FGL.

   o  Else if RBn can reach the destination through another member
      RBridge RBk, it tunnels the native frame to RBk by re-
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 18]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


      encapsulating it into a unicast TRILL Data packet and sends it to
      RBk. RBn uses RBk's regular nickname, instead of the pseudo-
      nickname as the egress nickname for the re-encapsulation, and the
      ingress nickname remains unchanged (somewhat similar to Section
      2.4.2.1 of [rfc7180bis]). If the hop count value of the packet is
      too small for it to reach RBk safely, RBn SHOULD increase that
      value properly in doing the re-encapsulation. (NOTE: When
      receiving that re-encapsulated TRILL Data packet, as the egress
      nickname of the packet is RBk's regular nickname rather than the
      pseudo-nickname of a local RBv, RBk will process it as Section
      4.6.2.4 of [RFC6325], and will not re-forward it to another
      RBridge.)

   o  Else, RBn does not know how to reach the destination; it sends the
      native frame out of all the local ports on which it is appointed
      forwarder for the Inner.VLAN (or appointed forwarder for the VLAN
      into which the Inner.Label maps on that port for FGL TRILL Data
      packet [RFC7172]).

6.2.2. Multi-Destination TRILL Data Packets

   When RB1 receives a multi-destination TRILL Data Packet, it checks
   and processes the packet as described in Section 4.6.2.5 of [RFC6325]
   with the following exception.

   o  On each RBv port where RBn is the appointed forwarder for the
      packet's Inner.VLAN (or for the VLAN to which the packet's
      Inner.Label maps on that port if it is an FGL TRILL Data packet),
      the Designated Forwarder check (see Section 5.2) and the Ingress
      Nickname Filtering check (see Section 5.3) are further performed.
      For such an RBv port, if either the DF check or the filtering
      check fails, the frame MUST NOT be egressed out of that port.
      Otherwise, it can be egressed out of that port.


7. MAC Information Synchronization in Edge Group

   An edge RBridge, say RB1 in LAALP1, may have learned a { MAC address,
   Data Label } to nickname correspondence for a remote host h1 when h1
   sends a packet to CE1. The returning traffic from CE1 may go to
   another member RBridge of LAALP1, for example RB2. RB2 may not have
   that correspondence stored. Therefore it has to do the flooding for
   unknown unicast. Such flooding is unnecessary since the returning
   traffic is almost always expected and RB1 had learned the address
   correspondence. To avoid the unnecessary flooding, RB1 SHOULD share
   the correspondence with other RBridges of LAALP1. RB1 synchronizes
   the correspondence by using the MAC-RI sub-TLV [RFC6165] in its
   ESADI-LSPs [RFC7357].
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 19]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   On the other hand, RB2 has learned the MAC address and Data Label of
   CE1 when CE1 sends a frame to h1 through RB2. The returning traffic
   from h1 may go to RB1. RB1 may not have CE1's MAC address and Data
   Label stored even though it is in the same LAALP for CE1 as RB2.
   Therefore it has to flood the traffic out of all its access ports
   where it is appointed forwarder for the VLAN (see Section 6.2.1) or
   the VLAN the FGL maps to on that port if the packet is FGL. Such
   flooding is unnecessary since the returning traffic is almost always
   expected and RB2 had learned the CE1's MAC and Data Label
   information. To avoid that unnecessary flooding, RB2 SHOULD share the
   MAC address and Data Label with other RBridges of LAALP1. RB2
   synchronizes the MAC address and Data Label by enclosing the relative
   MAC-RI TLV within a pair of boundary TRILL APPsub-TLVs for LAALP1
   (see Section 9.3) in its ESADI-LSP [RFC7357]. After receiving the
   enclosed MAC-RI TLVs, the member RBridges of LAALP1 (i.e., LAALP1
   related RBridges) treat the MAC address and Data Label as if it was
   learned by them locally on their member port of LAALP1; the LAALP1
   unrelated RBridges just ignore LAALP1's boundary APPsub-TLVs and
   treat the MAC address and Data Label as specified in [RFC7357].
   Furthermore, in order to make the LAALP1 unrelated RBridges know that
   the MAC and Data Label is reachable through the RBv that provides
   service to LAALP1, the Topology-id/Nickname field of the MAC-RI TLV
   SHOULD carry the pseudo-nickname of the RBv rather than zero or one
   of the originating RBridge's (i.e., RB2's) regular nicknames.


8. Member Link Failure in RBv

   As shown in Figure 4, suppose the link RB1-CE1 fails. Although a new
   RBv will be formed by RB2 and RB3 to provide active-active service
   for LAALP1 (see Section 5), the unicast traffic to CE1 might still be
   forwarded to RB1 before the remote RBridge learns CE1 is attached to
   the new RBv. That traffic might be disrupted by the link failure.
   Section 8.1 discusses the failure protection in this scenario.

   However, for multi-destination TRILL Data packets, they can reach all
   member RBridges of the new RBv and be egressed to CE1 by either RB2
   or RB3 (i.e., the new DF for the traffic's Inner.VLAN or the VLAN the
   packet's Inner.Label maps to in the new RBv). Although there might be
   a transient hang time between failure and the establishment of the
   new RBv, special actions to protect against downlink failure for such
   multi-destination packets is not needed.

8.1. Link Protection for Unicast Frame Egressing

   When the link CE1-RB1 fails, RB1 loses its direct connection to CE1.
   The MAC entry through the failed link to CE1 is removed from RB1's
   local forwarding table immediately. Another MAC entry learned from
   another member RBridge of LAALP1 (for example RB2, since it is still
   a member RBridge of LAALP1) is installed into RB1's forwarding table
   (see Section 9.3).  In that new entry, RB2 (identified by one of its
   regular nicknames) is the egress RBridge for CE1's MAC address. Then
   when a TRILL Data packet to CE1 is delivered to RB1, it can be
   tunneled to RB2 after being re-encapsulated (ingress nickname remains
   unchanged and egress nickname is replaced by RB2's regular nickname)
   based on the above installed MAC entry (see bullet 2 in Section
   6.2.1). Then RB2 receives the frame and egresses it to CE1.

   After the failure recovery, RB1 learns that it can reach CE1 via link
   CE1-RB1 again by observing CE1's native frames or from the MAC
   information synchronization by member RBridge(s) of LAALP1 described
   in Section 7, then it restores the MAC entry to its previous one and
   downloads it to its data plane fast path logic.


9. TLV Extensions for Edge RBridge Group

   The following subsections specify the APPsub-TLVs needed to support
   pseudo-nickname edge groups.

9.1. PN-LAALP-Membership APPsub-TLV

   This APPsub-TLV is used by an edge RBridge to announce its associated
   pseudo-nickname LAALP information. It is defined as a sub-TLV of the
   TRILL GENINFO TLV [RFC7357] and is distributed in E-L1FS FS-LSPs
   [rfc7180bis]. It has the following format:

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |  Type = PN-LAALP-Membership   |  (2 bytes)

   o  PN-LAALP-Membership (2 bytes): Defines the type of this sub-TLV,
      #tbd1.

   o  Length (2 bytes): the sum of the lengths of the LAALP RECORDs. 

   o  OE (1 bit): a flag indicating whether or not the LAALP wants to
      occupy an RBv by itself; 1 for occupying by itself (or Occupying
      Exclusively (OE)). By default, it is set to 0 on transmit. This
      bit is used for edge RBridge group auto-discovery (see Section
      4.1). For any one LAALP, the values of this flag might conflict in

      the LSPs advertised by different member RBridges of that LAALP. In
      that case, the flag for that LAALP is considered as 1.

   o  RESV (7 bits): MUST be transmitted as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  Size (1 byte): Size of remaining part of LAALP RECORD (2 plus
      length of the LAALP ID).

   o  Re-using Pseudo-nickname (2 bytes): Suggested pseudo-nickname of
      the AAE group serving the LAALP. If the LAALP is not served by any
      AAE group, this field MUST be set to zero. It is used by the
      originating RBridge to help the vDRB to reuse the previous pseudo-
      nickname of an AAE group (see Section 4.2).

   o  LAALP ID (variable): The ID of the LAALP. See Section 9.4.

   On receipt of such an APPsub-TLV, if RBn is not an LAALP related edge
   RBridge, it ignores the sub-TLV; otherwise, it parses the sub-TLV.
   When new LAALPs are found or old ones are withdrawn compared to its
   old copy, and they are also configured on RBn, it triggers RBn to
   perform the "Member RBridges Auto-Discovery" procedure described in
   Section 4.1.

9.2. PN-RBv APPsub-TLV

   The PN-RBv APPsub-TLV is used by a Designated RBridge of a Virtual
   RBridge (vDRB) to dictate the pseudo-nickname for the LAALPs served
   by the RBv. It is defined as a sub-TLV of TRILL GENINFO TLV [RFC7357]
   and is distributed in E-L1FS FS-LSP [rfc7180bis]. It has the
   following format:

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         | Type = PN-RBv                 |  (2 bytes)

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   o  PN-RBv (2 bytes): Defines the type of this sub-TLV, #tbd2.

   o  Length (2 bytes): 3+n*k bytes, where there are n LAALP IDs, each
      of size k bytes. k is found in the LLALP ID Size field below. If
      Length is not 3 plus an integer time k, the sub-TLV is corrupt and
      MUST be ignored.

   o  RBv's Pseudo-Nickname (2 bytes): The appointed pseudo-nickname for
      the RBv that serves for the LAALPs listed in the following fields.

   o  LAALP ID Size (1 byte): The size of each of the following LAALP
      IDs in this sub-TLV. 8 if the LAALPs listed are MC-LAGs or DRNI
      (Section 6.3.2 in [802.1AX]). The value in this field is the k
      that appears in the formula for Length above.

   o  LAALP ID (LAAP ID Size bytes): The ID of the LAALP. See Section
      9.4.

   This sub-TLV may occur multiple times with the same RBv pseudo-
   nickname with the meaning that all of the LAALPs listed are
   identified by that pseudo-nickname. For example, if there are LAALP
   IDs of different length, then the LAALP IDs of each size would have
   to be listed in a separate sub-TLV.

   Since a PN-RBv APPsub-TLV is distributed as part of the application
   link state, using the E-L1FS scope [rfc7180bis], changes in contents
   or withdrawal or creation of a PN-RBv APPsub-TLV is accomplished by
   the Designated RBridge updating and flooding an E-L1FS PDU.

   On receipt of such a sub-TLV, if RBn is not an LAALP related edge
   RBridge, it ignores the sub-TLV. Otherwise, if RBn is also a member
   RBridge of the RBv identified by the list of LAALPs, it associates
   the pseudo-nickname with the ports of these LAALPs and downloads the
   association to data plane fast path logic. At the same time, RBn
   claims RBv pseudo-nickname across the campus and announces RBv as its
   child on the corresponding tree or trees using the Affinity sub-TLV
   [RFC7176] [CMT]. 

9.3. PN-MAC-RI-LAALP Boundary APPsub-TLVs

   In this document, two APPsub-TLVs are used as boundary APPsub-TLVs
   for edge RBridge to enclose the MAC-RI TLV(s) containing the MAC
   address information leant form local port of an LAALP when this
   RBridge wants to share the information with other edge RBridges. They
   are defined as TRILL APPsub-TLVs [RFC7357]. The PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-
   START APPsub-TLV has the following format:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-...+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-START (2 bytes): Defines the type of this
      APPsub-TLV, #tbd3.

   o  Length (2 bytes): the size of the following LAALP ID. 8 if the
      LAALP listed is an MAC-LAG or DRNI.

   o  LAALP ID (variable): The ID of the LAALP (see Section 9.4).

   PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-END APPsub-TLV is defined as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Type=PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-END | (2 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | Length                        | (2 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-END (2 bytes): Defines the type of this sub-
      TLV, #tbd4.

   o  Length (2 bytes): 0.

   This pair of APPsub-TLVs can be carried multiple times in an ESADI
   LSP and in multiple ESADI-LSPs. When an LAALP related edge RBridge
   (say RBn) wants to share with other edge RBridges the MAC addresses
   learned on its local ports of different LAALPs, it uses one or more
   pairs of such APPsub-TLVs for each of such LAALPs in its ESADI-LSPs.
   Each encloses the MAC-RI TLVs containing the MAC addresses learned
   from a specific LAALP. Furthermore, if the LAALP is served by a local
   RBv, the value of Topology ID/Nickname field in the relative MAC-RI
   TLVs SHOULD be the pseudo-nickname of the RBv rather than one of the
   RBn's regular nickname or zero. Then on receipt of such a MAC-RI TLV,
   remote RBridges know that the contained MAC addresses are reachable
   through the RBv.

   On receipt of such boundary APPsub-TLVs, when the edge RBridge is not
   an LAALP related one or cannot recognize such sub-TLVs, it ignores
   them and continues to parse the enclosed MAC-RI TLVs per [RFC7357].
   Otherwise, the recipient parses the boundary APPsub-TLVs. The PN-MAC-
   RI-LAALP-INFO-START / PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-END pair MUST occur within
   one TRILL GENINFO TLV. If an END is encountered without any previous

   START in the ESADI-LSP, the END APPsub-TLV is ignored. If, after
   encountering a START, the end of the ESADI-LSP is reached without
   encountering an END, then the end of the ESADI-LSP is treated as if
   it were a PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-END. The boundary APPsub-TLVs and TLVs
   between them are handled as follows:

   1) If the edge RBridge is configured with the contained LAALP and the
      LAALP is also enabled locally, it treats all the MAC addresses,
      contained in the following MC-RI TLVs enclosed by the
      corresponding pair of boundary APPsub-TLVs, as if they were
      learned from its local port of that LAALP;

   2) Else, it ignores these boundary APPsub-TLVs and continues to parse
      the following MAC-RI TLVs per [RFC7357] until another pair of
      boundary APPsub-TLVs is encountered.

9.4. LAALP IDs

   The LAALP ID identifies an AAE RBridge Group in the TRILL campus and
   thus MUST be unique across the campus. In all of the APPsub-TLVs
   specified above, the length of the LAALP ID can be determined from a
   size field. If that length is 8 bytes, the LAALP ID is an MC-LAG or
   DRNI identifier as specified in Section 6.3.2 in [802.1AX]. The
   meaning and structure of LAALP IDs of other lengths is reserved and
   may be specified in future documents.

10. OAM Packets

   Attention must be paid when generating OAM packets.  To ensure the
   response messages can return to the originating member RBridge of an
   RBv, pseudo-nickname cannot be used as the ingress nickname in TRILL
   OAM messages, except in the response to an OAM message that has that
   RBv's pseudo-nickname as egress nickname. For example, assume RB1 is
   a member RBridge of RBvi, RB1 cannot use RBvi's pseudo-nickname as
   the ingress nickname when originating OAM messages; otherwise the
   responses to the messages may be delivered to another member RBridge
   of RBvi rather than RB1. But when RB1 responds to the OAM message
   with RBvi's pseudo-nickname as egress nickname, it can use that
   pseudo-nickname as the ingress nickname in the response message.

   Since RBridges cannot use OAM messages for the learning of MAC
   addresses (Section 3.2.1 of [RFC7174]), it will not lead to MAC
   address flip-flopping at a remote RBridge even though RB1 uses its
   regular nicknames as ingress nicknames in its TRILL OAM messages
   while uses RBvi's pseudo-nickname in its TRILL Data packets.

11. Configuration Consistency

 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 26]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   The VLAN membership of all the RBridge ports in an LAALP MUST be the
   same.  Any inconsistencies in VLAN membership may result in packet
   loss or non-shortest paths.

   Take Figure 1 for example, suppose RB1 configures VLAN1 and VLAN2 for
   the link CE1-RB1, while RB2 only configures VLAN1 for the CE1-RB2
   link.  Both RB1 and RB2 use the same ingress nickname RBv for all
   frames originating from CE1.  Hence, a remote RBridge RBx will learn
   that CE1's MAC address in VLAN2 is originating from RBv.  As a
   result, on the returning path, remote RBridge RBx may deliver VLAN2
   traffic to RB2. However, RB2 does not have VLAN2 configured on CE1-
   RB2 link and hence the frame may be dropped or has to be redirected
   to RB1 if RB2 knows RB1 can reach CE1 in VLAN2.

   How LAALP implementations maintain consistent VLAN configuration on
   the TRILL switch LAALP ports is out of scope for the TRILL protocol.
   However, considering the consequences that might cause by the
   inconsistency, TRILL switches MUST disable the ports connected to an
   LAALP with inconsistent VLAN configuration.

   It is important that if any VLAN in an LAALP is being mapped by edge
   RBridges to an FGL [RFC7172], that the mapping MUST be same for all
   edge RBridge ports in the LAALP. Otherwise, for example, unicast FGL
   TRILL Data packets from remote RBridges may get mapped into different
   VLANs depending on which edge RBridge receives and egresses them.

   It is important that RBridges in an AAE group not be configured to
   assert the OE bit if any RBridge in the group does not implement it.
   Since, as stated in [RFC7379], the RBridges in an AAE edge group are
   expected to be from the same vendor, due to the proprietary nature of
   deployed LAALPs, this will normally follow automatically from all of
   the RBridge in an AAE edge group supporting or all not supporting OE.


12. Security Considerations

   Authenticity for contents transported in IS-IS PDUs is enforced using
   regular IS-IS security mechanism [IS-IS] [RFC5310].

   For security considerations pertain to extensions transported by
   TRILL ESADI, see the Security Considerations section in [RFC7357].

   Since currently deployed LAALPs [RFC7379] are proprietary, security
   over membership in and internal management of active-active edge
   groups is proprietary. If authentication is not used, a rogue RBridge
   that insinuates itself into an active-active edge group can disrupt
   end station traffic flowing into or out of that group. For example,
   if there are N RBridges in the group, it could typically control
 


H. Zhai, et al                                                 [Page 27]

INTERNET DRAFT              Pseudo-Nickname           September 25, 2015


   1/Nth of the traffic flowing out of that group and a similar amount
   of unicast traffic flowing into that group. For multi-destination
   traffic flowing into that group, it could control all that was in a
   VLAN for which it was DF and it can exercise substantial control over
   the DF election by changing its own System ID.

   For general TRILL Security Considerations, see [RFC6325].


13. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate code points tbd1, tbd2, tbd3 and tbd4
   from the range below 255 for the 4 TRILL APPsub-TLVs specified in
   Section 9 and add them to the TRILL APPsub-TLV Types registry as
   follows:

        Type    Name                       Reference
        ----  --------------------------  ---------------
        tbd1  PN-LAALP-Membership         [this document]
        tbd2  PN-RBv                      [this document]
        tbd3  PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-START  [this document]
        tbd4  PN-MAC-RI-LAALP-INFO-END    [this document]
