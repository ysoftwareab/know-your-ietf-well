Abstract

   Already existing proposals enable Mobile Networks by extending Mobile
   IP to support Mobile Routers. In order to enable nested Mobile
   Networks, some involve the overhead of nested tunnels between the
   Mobile Routers and their Home Agents.

   This proposal allows the building of a nested Mobile Network avoiding
   the nested tunnel overhead. This is accomplished by using a new
   routing header, called the reverse routing header, and by overlaying
   a layer 3 tree topology on the evolving Mobile Network.

Internet-Draft         The Reverse Routing Header          February 2004


1. Introduction

   This document assumes the reader is familiar with the Mobile Networks
   terminology defined in [2] and with Mobile IPv6 defined in [1].

   Generally a Mobile Network may be either simple (a network with one
   mobile router) or nested, single or multi-homed. This proposal starts
   from the assumption that nested Mobile Networks will be the norm, and
   so presents a solution that avoids the tunnel within tunnel overhead
   of already existing proposals.

   The solution is based on a single bi-directional tunnel between the
   first Mobile Router (MR) to forward a packet and its Home Agent (HA).
   By using IPsec ESP on that tunnel, home equivalent privacy is
   obtained without further encapsulation.

   The solution uses a new Routing Header (RH), called the Reverse
   Routing Header (RRH), to provide an optimized path for the single
   tunnel. RRH is a variant of IPv4 Loose Source and Record Route (LSRR)
   [6] adapted for IPv6. RRH records the route out of the nested Mobile
   Network and can be trivially converted into a routing header for
   packets destined to the Mobile Network.

   This version focuses on single-homed Mobile Networks. Hints for
   further optimizations and multi-homing are given in the appendixes.

   Local Fixed Node (LFN) and Correspondent Node (CN) operations are
   left unchanged as in Mobile IPv6 [1]. Specifically the CN can also be
   a LFN.

   Section 3 proposes an example to illustrate the operation of the
   proposed solution, leaving detailed specifications to the remaining
   chapters. The reader may refer to Section 2.1 for the specific
   terminology.

1.1 Recursive complexity

   A number of drafts and publications suggest -or can be extended to- a
   model where the Home Agent and any arbitrary Correspondent would
   actually get individual binding from the chain of nested Mobile
   Routers, and form a routing header appropriately.

   An intermediate MR would keep track of all the pending communications
   between hosts in its subtree of Mobile Networks and their CNs, and a
   binding message to each CN each time it changes its point of
   attachment.

   If this was done, then each CN, by receiving all the binding messages

   and processing them recursively, could infer a partial topology of
   the nested Mobile Network, sufficient to build a multi-hop routing
   header for packets sent to nodes inside the nested Mobile Network.

   However, this extension has a cost:

   1.  Binding Update storm

       when one MR changes its point of attachment, it needs to send a
       BU to all the CNs of each node behind him. When the Mobile
       Network is nested, the number of nodes and relative CNs can be
       huge, leading to congestions and drops.

   2.  Protocol Hacks

       Also, in order to send the BUs, the MR has to keep track of all
       the traffic it forwards to maintain his list of CNs. In case of
       IPSec tunneled traffic, that CN information may not be available.

   3.  CN operation

       The computation burden of the CN becomes heavy, because it has to
       analyze each BU in a recursive fashion in order to infer nested
       Mobile Network topology required to build a multi hop routing
       header.

   4.  Missing BU

       If a CN doesn't receive the full set of PSBU sent by the MR, it
       will not be able to infer the full path to a node inside the
       nested Mobile Network.  The RH will be incomplete and the packet
       may or may not be delivered.

   5.  Obsolete BU

       If the Binding messages are sent asynchronously by each MR, then,
       when the relative position of MRs and/or the TLMR point of
       attachment change rapidly, the image of Mobile Network that the
       CN maintains is highly unstable. If only one BU in the chain is
       obsolete due to the movement of an intermediate MR, the
       connectivity may be lost.

   A conclusion is that the path information must be somehow aggregated
   to provide the CN with consistent snapshots of the full path across
   the Mobile Network. This can be achieved by an IPv6 form of loose
   source / record route header, that we introduce here as a Reverse
   Routing Header

2. Terminology and Assumptions

2.1 Terminology

   Simple Mobile Network

      One or more IP subnets attached to a MR and mobile as a unit, with
      respect to the rest of the Internet. A simple Mobile Network can
      be either single or multi-homed.

      The IP subnets may have any kind of topology and may contain fixed
      routers.  All the access points of the Mobile Network (to which
      further MRs may attach) are on the same layer 2 link of the MR.

      We like to represent a simple single-homed Mobile Network as an
      hanger, because it has only one uplink hook and a bar to which
      multiple hooks can be attached. Graphically we use the question
      mark "?" to show the uplink hook (interface) connected to the MR,
      and the "=" sign to represent the bar:

                                   ?
                                  MR1
                                   |
                            ===============

   Nested Mobile Network

      A group of simple Mobile Networks recursively attached together
      and implementing nested Mobility as defined in [2].

                                    ?
                                   MR1

   IPv6 Mobile Host

      A IPv6 Host, with support for MIPv6 MN, and the additional Nemo
      capability described in this draft.

   Home prefix

      Network prefix, which identifies the home link within the Internet
      topology.

   Mobile Network prefix

      Network prefix, common to all IP addresses in the Mobile Network
      when the MR is attached to the home link. It may or may not be a
      subset of the Home subnet prefix.

   Inbound direction:

      direction from outside the Mobile Network to inside

   Outbound direction:

      direction from inside the Mobile Network to outside


2.2 Assumptions

   We make the following assumptions:

   1.  A MR has one Home Agent and one Home Address -> one primary CoA.

   2.  A MR attaches to a single Attachment Router as default router.

   3.  A MR may have more than one uplink interface.

   4.  An interface can be either wired or wireless. The text assumes
       that interfaces are wireless for generality.

   5.  Each simple Mobile Network may have more that one L2 Access
       Point, all of them controlled by the same Attachment Router,
       which we assume to be the Mobile Router.

   Since an MR has only one primary CoA, only one uplink interface can
   be used at a given point of time. Since the MR attaches to a single
   attachment router, if due care is applied to avoid loops, then the
   resulting topology is a tree.

3. An Example

   The nested Mobile Network in the following figure has a tree
   topology, according to the assumptions in Section 2.2. In the tree
   each node is a simple Mobile Network, represented by its MR.

                                        |
                                  ==|=========?==   <-- Mobile Network3

                       An example nested Mobile Network

   This example focuses on a Mobile Network node at depth 3 (Mobile
   Network3) inside the tree, represented by its mobile router MR3. The
   path to the Top Level Mobile Router (TLMR) MR1 and then the Internet
   is

                       MR3 -> MR2 -> MR1 -> Internet

    Consider the case where a LFN belonging to Mobile Network3 sends a
   packet to a CN in the Internet, and the CN replies back. With the
   tunnel within tunnel approach described by [3], we would have three
   bi-directional nested tunnels:


                                 -----------.
                       --------/          /-----------.
              -------/        |          |           /-----------
    CN ------( -  - | -  -  - |  -  -  - | -  -  -  |  -  -  -  (-------- LFN
       MR3_HA -------\        |          |           \----------- MR3
                MR2_HA --------\          \----------- MR2
                          MR1_HA ----------- MR1

   Depending on the relative location of MR1_HA, MR2_HA and MR3_HA, this
   may lead to a very inefficient "pinball" routing in the
   Infrastructure.

   On the other hand, with the RRH approach we would have only one
   bi-directional tunnel:


              --------------------------------- MR1 ---- MR2 ---- MR3
    CN ------(  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  (-------- LFN
       MR3_HA --------------------------------- MR1 ---- MR2 ---- MR3



   The first mobile router on the path, MR3, in addition to tunneling
   the packet to its HA, adds a reverse routing header with N = 3
   pre-allocated slots. Choosing the right value for N is discussed in
   Section 6.2. The bottom slot is equivalent to the MIPv6 Home Address
   option. MR3 inserts its home address MR3_HoA into slot 0.

   The outer packet has source MR3's Care of Address, MR3_CoA, and
   destination MR3's Home Agent, MR3_HA:


   <-------------- outer IPv6 header -------------------->
   +-------+-------++ -- ++----+-------+-------+---------+ +-------
   |oSRC   |oDST   |:    :|oRRH| slot2 | slot1 | slot0   | |
   |MR3_CoA|MR3_HA |:oEXT:|type|       |       |MR3_HoA  | |iPACKET
   |       |       |:    :| 4  |       |       |         | |
   +-------+-------++ -- ++----+-------+-------+---------+ +-------


   The second router on the path, MR2, notices that the packet already
   contains an RRH, and so it overwrites the source address of the
   packet with its own address, MR2_CoA, putting the old source address,
   MR3_CoA, in the first free slot of the RRH.

   The outer packet now has source MR2_CoA and destination MR3_HA; the
   RRH from top to bottom is MR3_CoA | MR3_HoA:


   <-------------- outer IPv6 header -------------------->
   +-------+-------++ -- ++----+-------+-------+---------+ +-------
   |oSRC   |oDST   |:    :|oRRH| slot2 | slot1 | slot0   | |
   |MR2_CoA|MR3_HA |:oEXT:|type|       |MR3_CoA|MR3_HoA  | |iPACKET
   |       |       |:    :| 4  |       |       |         | |
   +-------+-------++ -- ++----+-------+-------+---------+ +-------

   In general the process followed by the second router is repeated by
   all the routers on the path, including the TLMR (in this example
   MR1). When the packet leaves MR1 the source address is MR1_CoA and
   the RRH is MR2_CoA | MR3_CoA | MR3_HoA:


   <-------------- outer IPv6 header -------------------->
   +-------+-------++ -- ++----+-------+-------+---------+ +-------
   |oSRC   |oDST   |:    :|oRRH| slot2 | slot1 | slot0   | |
   |MR1_CoA|MR3_HA |:oEXT:|type|MR2_CoA|MR3_CoA|MR3_HoA  | |iPACKET
   |       |       |:    :| 4  |       |       |         | |
   +-------+-------++ -- ++----+-------+-------+---------+ +-------


   In a colloquial way we may say that while the packet travels from MR3
   to MR3_HA, the Mobile Network tunnel end point "telescopes" from MR3
   to MR2 to MR1.

   When the home agent MR3_HA receives the packet it notices that it
   contains a RRH and it looks at the bottom entry, MR3_HoA. This entry
   is used as if it were a MIPv6 Home Address destination option, i.e.
   as an index into the Binding Cache. When decapsulating the inner
   packet the home agent performs the checks described in Section 8, and
   if successful it forwards the inner packet to CN.

   MR3_HA stores two items in the Bind Cache Entry associated with MR3:
   the address entries from RRH, to be used to build the RH, and the
   packet source address MR1_CoA, to be used as the first hop.

   Further packets from the CN to the LFN are plain IPv6 packets.
   Destination is LFN, and so the packet reaches MR3's home network.

   MR3_HA intercepts it, does a Bind Cache prefix lookup and obtains as
   match the MR3 entry, containing the first hop and the information
   required to build the RH. It then puts the packet in the tunnel
   MR3_HA -- MR3 as follows: source address MR3_HA and destination
   address the first hop, MR1_CoA. The RH is trivially built out of the
   previous RRH: MR2_CoA | MR3_CoA | MR3_HoA:

   The packet is routed with plain IP routing up to the first
   destination MR1_CoA.

   The RH of the outer packet is type 2 as in MIPv6 [1], but has
   additional semantics inherited from type 0: it contains the path
   information to traverse the nested Mobile Network from the TLMR to
   the tunnel endpoint MR3. Each intermediate destination forwards the
   packet to the following destination in the routing header. The
   security aspects of this are treated in Section 11.2.

   MR1, which is the initial destination in the IP header, looks at the
   RH and processes it according to Section 9, updating the RH and the
   destination and sending it to MR2_CoA. MR2 does the same and so on
   until the packet reaches the tunnel endpoint, MR3.

   When the packet reaches MR3, the source address in the IP header is
   MR3_HA, the destination is MR3_CoA and in the RH there is one segment
   left, MR3_HoA. As a consequence the packet belongs to the MR3_HA --
   MR3 tunnel. MR3 decapsulates the inner packet, applying the rules
   described in Section 9 and sends it to LFN. The packet that reaches
   LFN is the plain IPv6 packet that was sent by CN.

4. New Routing Headers

   This draft modifies the MIPv6 Routing Header type 2 and introduces
   two new Routing Headers, type 3 and 4. Type 3, which is an
   optimization of type 4 will be discussed in Appendix A.2.1. The draft
   presents their operation in the context of Mobile Routers although
   the formats are not tied to Mobile IP and could be used in other
   situations.

4.1 Routing Header Type 2 (MIPv6 RH with extended semantics)

   Mobile IPv6 uses a Routing header to carry the Home Address for
   packets sent from a Correspondent Node to a Mobile Node. In [1], this
   Routing header (Type 2) is restricted to carry only one IPv6 address.
   The format proposed here extends the Routing Header type 2 to be
   multi-hop.

   The processing of the multi-hop RH type 2 inherits from the RH type 0
   described in IPv6 [10]. Specifically: the restriction on multicast
   addresses is the same; a RH type 2 is not examined or processed until
   it reaches the node identified in the Destination Address field of
   the IPv6 header; in that node, the RH type 0 algorithm applies, with
   added security checks.

   The construction of the multi-hop RH type 2 by the HA is described in
   Section 8; the processing by the MRs is described in Section 9.5; and
   the security aspects are treated in Section 11.2.

   The destination node of a packet containing a RH type 2 can be a MR
   or some other kind of node. If it is a MR it will perform the
   algorithm described in Section 9.5, otherwise it will operate as
   prescribed by IPv6 [10] when the routing type is unrecognized.

      units, not including the first 8 octets.  For the Type 2 Routing
      header, Hdr Ext Len is equal to two times the number of addresses
      in the header.

   Routing Type

      8-bit unsigned integer. Set to 2.

      8-bit unsigned integer.  Number of route segments remaining, i.e.,
      number of explicitly listed intermediate nodes still to be visited
      before reaching the final destination.

   Reserved

      32-bit reserved field.  Initialized to zero for transmission;
      ignored on reception.

   Address[1..n]

      Vector of 128-bit addresses, numbered 1 to n.


4.2 Routing Header Type 4 (The Reverse Routing Header)

   The Routing Header type 4, or Reverse Routing Header (RRH), is a
   variant of IPv4 loose source and record route (LSRR) [6] adapted for
   IPv6.

   Addresses are added from bottom to top (0 to n-1 in the picture). The
   RRH is designed to help the destination build an RH for the return
   path.

   When a RRH is present in a packet, the rule for upper-layer checksum
   computing is that the source address used in the pseudo-header is
   that of the original source, located in the slot 0 of the RRH, unless
   the RRH slot 0 is empty, in which case the source in the IP header of
   the packet is used.

   As the 'segment left' field of the generic RH is reassigned to the
   number of segments used, an IPv6 node that does not support RRH will
   discard the packet, unless the RRH is empty.

   The RRH contains n pre-allocated address slots, to be filled by each
   MR in the path. It is possible to optimize the number of slots using
   the Tree Information Option described in Section 6.2.

      in the header.

   Routing Type

      8-bit unsigned integer. Set to 4.

   Segments Used

      8-bit unsigned integer. Number of slots used. Initially set to 1
      by the MR when only the Home Address is there.  Incremented by the
      MRs on the way as they add the packets source addresses to the
      RRH.

   Sequence Number

      32-bit unsigned integer. The Sequence Number starts at 0, and is
      incremented by the source upon each individual packet. Using the
      Radia Perlman's lollipop algorithm, values between 0 and 255 are
      'negative', left to indicate a reboot or the loss of HA
      connectivity, and are skipped when wrapping and upon positive
      Binding Ack. The sequence number is used to check the freshness of
      the RRH; anti-replay protection is left to IPsec AH.

   Slot[n-1..0]

      Vector of 128-bit addresses, numbered n-1 to 0.

   When applied to the Nemo problem, the RRH can be used to update the
   HA on the actual location of the MR. Only MRs forwarding packets on
   an egress interface while not at home update it on the fly.

   A RRH is inserted by the first MR on the Mobile Network outbound
   path, as part of the reverse tunnel encapsulation; it is removed by
   the associated HA when the tunneled packet is decapsulated.

4.3 Extension Header order

   The RH type 2 is to be placed as any RH as described in [10] section
   4.1. If a RH type 0 is present in the packet, then the RH type 2 is
   placed immediately after the RH type 0, and the RH type 0 MUST be
   consumed before the RH type 2.

   RH type 3 and 4 are mutually exclusive. They are to be placed right
   after the Hop-by-Hop Options header if any, or else right after the
   IPv6 header.

5. ICMP

   The RRH could have fewer slots than the number of MRs in the path
   because either the nested Mobile Network topology is changing too
   quickly or the MR that inserted the RRH could have a wrong
   representation of the topology.

   To solve this problem a new ICMP message is introduced, "RRH
   Warning", type 64. Note that this ICMP message creates a new class of
   warning messages besides the error messages and the control messages
   of ICMP.

   This message allows a MR on the path to propose a larger number of
   slots to the MR that creates the RRH. The Proposed Size MUST be
   larger than the current size and MUST NOT be larger than 8.

   The originating MR must rate-limit the ICMP messages to avoid
   excessive ICMP traffic in the case of the source failing to operate
   as requested.

   The originating MR must insert an RH type 2 based on the RRH in the
   associated IP header, in order to route the ICMP message back to the
   source of the reverse tunnel. A MR that receives this ICMP message is
   the actual destination and it MUST NOT forward it to the (LFN) source
   of the tunneled packet.

   A MR on the path that finds no more space in the RRH SHOULD send an
   ICMP "RRH warning" back to the MR that inserted the RRH. On the other
   hand, a MR should always be able, by receiving TI option with up to
   date tree depth (see Section Section 6.2). to correctly size the RRH
   to insert in an outgoing packet.

6. Modifications to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery

6.1 Modified Router Advertisement Message Format

   Mobile IPv6 [1] modifies the format of the Router Advertisement
   message [11] by the addition of a single flag bit (H) to indicate
   that the router sending the Advertisement message is serving as a
   home agent on this link.

   This draft adds another single flag bit (N) to indicate that the
   router sending the advertisement message is a MR. This means that the
   link on which the message is sent is a Mobile Network, which may or
   may not be at home.

   The Router Advertisement message has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

    |   Options ...
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-

   This format represents the following changes over that originally
   specified for Neighbor Discovery [11]:

   Home Agent (H)

      The Home Agent (H) bit is set in a Router Advertisement to
      indicate that the router sending this Router Advertisement is also
      functioning as a Mobile IP home agent on this link.

   NEMO Capable (N)

      The NEMO Capable (N) bit is set in a Router Advertisement to
      indicate that the router sending this Router Advertisement is also
      functioning as a Mobile Router on this link, so that the link is a
      Mobile Network, possibly away from home.

6.2 New Tree Information Option Format

   This draft defines a new Tree Information option, used in Router
   Advertisement messages. Fields set by the TLMR are propagated
   transparently by the MRs. Mobile Routers SHOULD add that option to
   the Router Advertisement messages sent over the ingress interfaces.

   The Tree Information option has the following format:

     0                   1                   2                   3

      functioning as a Home Agent, for re-homing purposes.

   Reserved

      6-bit unsigned integer, set to 0 by the TLMR.

   Bandwidth

      8-bit unsigned integer set by the TLMR and decremented by MRs with
      lower egress bandwidth. This is a power of 2 so that the available
      egress bandwidth in bps is between 2^Bandwidth and
      2^(Bandwidth+1). 0 means 'unspecified' and can not be modified
      down the tree.

   PathCRC

      32-bit unsigned integer CRC, updated by each MR. This is the
      result of a CRC-32c computation on a bit string obtained by
      appending the received value and the MR CareOf Address. TLMRs use
      a 'previous value' of zeroes to initially set the pathCRC.

   Tree Group

      IPv6 global address, set by the TLMR. Identifier of the tree
      group. A MR may use the Tree Group in its tree selection
      algorithm.

   The TLMR MUST include this option in its Router Advertisements.

   A MR receiving this option from its Attachment Router MUST update the
   TreeDepth, MRPreference, BootTimeRandom and PathCRC fields, and MUST
   propagate it on its ingress interface(s), as described in Section
   9.4.

7. Binding Cache Management

7.1 Binding Updates

   A MIPv6 or NEmo Binding Update provides more information than just
   the path in the nested cloud so they are still used as described in
   MIPv6 [1] for Home Registration and de-registration. The only
   difference when using RRH is that the Home Address Destination Option
   and the alternate CareOf MIP option MUST be omitted.

7.2 RRH Heartbeat

   Intermediate updates (or just refreshes) between BUs are obtained as
   one of the results of processing the RRH by the HA.

   When the MR becomes aware of a topology change in the tree (for
   examples it changes point of attachment, it obtains a new CoA, it
   receives a Tree Information Option in an RA message that indicates a
   change in the attachment tree) or in the absence of traffic (detected
   by a timeout) to the HA, it must send an RRH Heartbeat, which is a
   binding update with a RRH.

8. Home Agent Operation

   This section inherits from chapter 10 of MIPv6 [1], which is kept
   unmodified except for parts 10.5 and 10.6 which are extended. This
   draft mostly adds the opportunity for a MN to update the Binding
   Cache of its Home Agent using RRH, though it does not change the fact
   that MNs still need to select a home agent, register and deregister
   to it, using the MIP Bind Update.

   This draft extends [1] section 10.6 as follows:

   o  The entry point of the tunnel is now checked against the TLMR as
      opposed to the primary CoA.

   o  The Binding Cache can be updated based on RRH with proper AH
      authentication.

   As further explained in Section 7.1, this specification modifies MIP
   so that the HA can rely on the RH type 4 (RRH) to update its Bind
   Cache Entry (BCE), when the Mobile Node moves. The conceptual content
   of the BCE is extended to contain a sequence counter, and the
   sequence of hops within the --potentially nested-- Mobile Network to
   a given Mobile Node. The sequence counter is initially set to 0.

   When the HA receives a packet destined to itself, it checks for the
   presence of a Routing Header of type 3 or 4. Both contain as least
   the entry for the home address of the MN in slot 0; this replaces the
   MIP Home Address Option and allows the HA to determine the actual
   source of the packet, to access the corresponding security
   association.

   As explained in Section 11.2, the HA MUST verify the authenticity of
   the packet using IPSEC AH and drop packets that were not issued by
   the proper Mobile Node. An RRH is considered only if the packet is
   authenticated and if its sequence number is higher than the one saved
   in the BCE.

   Also, an RRH is considered only if an initial Bind Update exchange
   has been successfully completed between the Mobile Node and its Home
   Agent for Home Registration. If the RRH is valid, then the Bind Cache
   Entry is revalidated for a lifetime as configured from the initial
   Bind Update.

Internet-Draft         The Reverse Routing Header          February 2004


   The BCE abstract data is updated as follows:

      The first hop for the return path is the last hop on the path of
      the incoming packet, that is between the HA and the Top Level
      Mobile Router (TLMR) of the Mobile Network. The HA saves the IP
      address of the TLMR from the source field in the IP header.

      The rest of the path to the MN is found in the RRH.

      The sequence counter semantics is changed as described in Section
      4.2


   This draft extends [1] section 10.5 as follows:

      A Home Agent advertises the prefixes of its registered Mobile
      Routers, during the registration period, on the local Interior
      Gateway Protocol (IGP).

      The Routing Header type 2 is extended to be multi-hop.

   The Home Agent is extended to support routes to prefixes that are
   owned by Mobile Routers. This can be configured statically, or can be
   exchanged using a routing protocol as in [3], which is out of the
   scope of this document. As a consequence of this process, the Home
   Agent which is selected by a Mobile Router advertises reachability of
   the MR prefixes for the duration of the registration over the local
   IGP.

   When a HA gets a packet for which the destination is a node behind a
   Mobile Router, it places the packet in the tunnel to the associated
   MR. This ends up with a packet which destination address in the IP
   Header is the TLMR, and with a Routing Header of type 2 for the rest
   of the way to the Mobile Router, which may be multi-hop.

   To build the RH type 2 from the RRH, the HA sets the type to 2, and
   clears the bits 32-63 (byte 4 to 7).

9. Mobile Router Operation

   This section inherits from chapter 11 of [1], which is extended to
   support Mobile Networks and Mobile Routers as a specific case of
   Mobile Node.

   This draft extends section 11.2.1 of MIPv6 [1] as follows:

   o  When not at home, an MR uses a reverse tunnel with its HA for all
      the traffic that is sourced in its mobile network(s); traffic
      originated further down a nested network is not tunneled twice but
      for exception cases.

   o  The full path to and within the Mobile Network is piggy-backed
      with the traffic on a per-packet basis to cope with rapid
      movement. This makes the packet construction different from MIPv6.

   The MR when not at home sets up a bi-directional tunnel with its HA.
   The reverse direction MR -> HA is needed to assure transparent
   topological correctness to LFNs, as in [3].  But, as opposed to that
   solution, nested tunnels are generally avoided.

9.1 Processing of ICMP "RRH too small"

   The New ICMP message "RRH too Small" is presented in Section 5. This
   message is addressed to the MR which performs the tunnel
   encapsulation and generates the RRH.

   Hence, a MR that receives the ICMP "RRH too small" MUST NOT propagate
   it to the originating LFN or inner tunnel source, but MUST process it
   for itself.

   If the Current Size in the ICMP messages matches the actual current
   number of slots in RRH, and if the ICMP passes some safety checks as
   described in Section 5, then the MR MAY adapt the number of slots to
   the Proposed Size.

9.2 Processing of ICMP error


   ICMP back {

      if RRH is present {
         compute RH type 2 based on RRH
         get packet source from IP header
         send ICMP error to source including RH type 2.
      }
      else {
         get packet source from IP header
         send ICMP error to source with no RH.
      }
   }


   When the MR receives an ICMP error message, it checks whether it is
   the final destination of the packet by looking at the included
   packet. If the included packet has an RRH, then the MR will use the
   RRH to forward the ICMP to the original source of the packet.

9.3 Processing of RHH for Outbound Packets

   if no RRH in outer header              /* First Mobile Router specific */
      or RRH present but saturated {      /* Need a nested encapsulation */

      if RRH is saturated {
         do ICMP back (RRH too small)
      }

      /* put packet in sliding reverse tunnel */
      insert new IP header plus RRH
      set source address to the MR Home Address
      set destination address to the MR Home Agent Address
      add an RRH with all slots zeroed out
      compute IPsec AH on the resulting packet
   }

   /* All MRs including first */
   if packet size <= MTU {
      select first free slot in RRH bottom up
      set it to source address from IP header
      overwrite source address in IP header with MR CareOf
      transmit packet
   } else {
      do ICMP back (Packet too Big)
   }

Internet-Draft         The Reverse Routing Header          February 2004


   If the packet already contains an RRH in the outer header, and has a
   spare slot, the MR adds the source address from the packet IP header
   to the RRH and overwrites the source address in the IP header with
   its CoA. As a result, the packets are always topologically correct.

   Else, if the RRH is present but is saturated, and therefore the
   source IP can not be added, the MR sends a ICMP 'RRH too small' to
   the tunnel endpoint which originated the outer packet, using the RRH
   info to route it back. The ICMP message is a warning, and the packet
   is not discarded. Rather, the MR does a nested encapsulation of the
   packet in its own reverse tunnel home with an additional RRH.

   Else, if the packet does not have an RRH, the MR puts it in its
   reverse tunnel, sourced at the CoA, with an RRH indicating in slot 0
   the Home Address of the MR, and with proper IPsec AH as described
   further in Section 11.1.

9.4 Processing of Tree Information Option

   The Tree Information option in Router Advertisement messages allows
   the Mobile Router to select a tree and learn about its capabilities.
   The treeDepth can be used to compute the optimum number of slots in
   the RRH.

   The RRH contains an entry for the home address in slot 0, and one for
   every CareOf on the way but that of the last Mobile Router (TLMR). As
   the TLMR sets the treeDepth to 0 and each MR increments it on the way
   down the tree, the optimum number of slots is normally (treeDepth+1),
   where treeDepth is the depth advertised by the MR over its Mobile
   Networks.

9.5 Processing of the extended Routing Header Type 2

   if Segments Left = 0 {

      /* new check: packet must be looped back internally */
      if packet doesn't come from a loopback interface {
          discard the packet
          return
      }

      proceed to process the next header in the packet, whose type is
      identified by the Next Header field in the Routing header
   }
   else if Hdr Ext Len is odd {
         send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message to the Source
         Address, pointing to the Hdr Ext Len field, and discard the
         packet

   }
   else {
      compute n, the number of addresses in the Routing header, by
      dividing Hdr Ext Len by 2

      if Segments Left is greater than n {
         send an ICMP Parameter Problem, Code 0, message to the Source
         Address, pointing to the Segments Left field, and discard the
         packet
      }
      else {
         decrement Segments Left by 1;

         compute i, the index of the next address to be visited in
         the address vector, by subtracting Segments Left from n

         if Address [i] or the IPv6 Destination Address is multicast {
            discard the packet
         }
         else {
            /* new security check */
            if Address [i] doesn't belong to one of the Mobile Network prefixes {
                discard the packet
                return
            }

            /* new check: keep MIPv6 behavior: prevent packets from being
             * forwarded outside the node.
             */
            if Segments Left equals 0 and Address[i] isn't the node's own
            home address {
                discard the packet
                return
            }
            swap the IPv6 Destination Address and Address[i]
            if the IPv6 Hop Limit is less than or equal to 1 {
               send an ICMP Time Exceeded -- Hop Limit Exceeded in
               Transit message to the Source Address and discard the

9.6 Decapsulation

   A MR when decapsulating a packet from its HA must perform the
   following checks

   1.  Destination address

       The destination address of the inner packet must belong to one of
       the Mobile Network prefixes.


10. Mobile Host Operation

   When it is at Home, a Mobile Host issues packets with source set to
   its home address and with destination set to its CN, in a plain IPv6
   format.

   When a MH is not at home but is attached to a foreign link in the
   Fixed Infrastructure, it SHOULD use MIPv6 as opposed to this draft to
   manage its mobility.

   When a MH is visiting a foreign Mobile Network, it forwards its
   outbound packets over the reverse tunnel (including RRH) to its HA.
   One can view that operation as a first MR process applied on a plain
   IPv6 packet issued by a LFN.

   As a result, the encapsulating header include:

      with source set to the MH COA and destination set to the MH HA

      with slot 0 set to the MH Home Address

   The inner packet is the plain IPv6 packet from the MH Home Address to
   the CN.

11. Security Considerations

   This section is not complete; further work is needed to analyse and
   solve the security problems of record and source route.

   Compared to MIPv6, the main security problem seems to be the fact
   that the RRH can be modified in transit by an attacker on the path.
   It has to be noted that such an attacker (for example any MR in the
   Mobile Network) can perform more effective attacks than modifying the
   RRH.

11.1 IPsec Processing

Internet-Draft         The Reverse Routing Header          February 2004


   The IPsec [7] AH [8] and ESP [9] can be used in tunnel mode to
   provide different security services to the tunnel between a MR and
   its HA. ESP tunnel mode SHOULD be used to provide confidentiality and
   authentication to the inner packet. AH tunnel mode MUST be used to
   provide authentication of the outer IP header fields, especially the
   Routing Headers.

11.1.1 Routing Header type 2

   Due to the possible usage of Doors [5] to enable IPv4 traversal, the
   Routing Header type 2 cannot be treated as type 0 for the purpose of
   IPsec processing (i.e. it cannot be included in its intierity in the
   Integrity Check Value (ICV) computation, because NAT/PAT may mangle
   one of the MR care-of-addresses along the HA-MR path.

   The sender (the HA) will put the slot 0 entry (the MR Home Address)
   of the RH as destination of the outer packet, will zero out
   completely the Routing Header and will perform the ICV computation.

   The receiver (the MR) will put the slot 0 entry as destination of the
   outer packet, will zero out the Routing Header and will perform the
   ICV verification.

11.1.2 Routing Header type 4

   The Routing Header type 4 is "partially mutable", and as such can be
   included in the Authentication Data calculation. Given the way type 4
   is processed, the sender cannot order the field so that it appears as
   it will at the receiver; this means the receiver will have to shuffle
   the fields.

   The sender (the MR) will zero out all the slots and the Segment Used
   field of the RRH, and will put as source address of the outer packet
   its Home Address, and then will perform the ICV computation.

   The receiver (the HA) will put the entry in slot 0 (the MR Home
   Address) in the source address and will zero out all the slots and
   the Segment Used field of the RRH, and then will perform the ICV
   verification.

11.2 New Threats

   The RH type 4 is used to construct a MIPv6 RH type 2 with additional
   semantics, as described in Section 4.1. Since RH type 2 becomes a
   multi hop option like RH type 0, care must be applied to avoid the
   spoofing attack that can be performed with the IPv4 source route
   option. This is why IPv6 [10] takes special care in responding to
   packets carrying Routing Headers.

   AH authenticates the MR Home Address identity and the RRH sequence
   number. The RRH sequence number is to be used to check the freshness
   of the RRH; anti-replay protection can be obtained if the receiver
   enables the anti-replay service of AH [8].

   In particular, if IPSec is being used, the content is protected and
   can not be read or modified, so there is no point in redirecting the
   traffic just to screen it.

   Say a MR in a nested structure modifies the RRH in order to bomb a
   target outside of the tree. If that MR forwards the packet with
   itself as source address, the MR above it will make sure that the
   response packets come back to the attacker first, since that source
   is prepended to the RRH. If it forges the source address, then the
   ingress filtering at the MR above it should detect the irregularity
   and drop the packet. Same if the attacker is actually TLMR. The
   conclusion is that ingress filtering is recommended at MR and AR.

   Say that an attacker in the infrastructure and on the path of the
   MRHA tunnel modifies the RRH in order to redirect the response
   packets and bomb a target. Considering the position of the attacker -
   a compromised access or core router - there's a lot more it could do
   to send perturbations to the traffic, like changing source and
   destinations of packets on the fly or eventually polute the routing
   protocols.

   Say a MR in a nested structure modifies the RH 2 in order to attack a
   target outside of the tree. The RH type 2 forwarding rules make sure
   that the packet can only go down a tree. So unless the attacker is
   TLMR, the packet will not be forwarded. In any case, the attacker
   will be bombed first.

   Say that an attacker on the path of the MRHA tunnel modifies the RRH
   in order to black out the MR. The result could actually be
   accomplished by changing any bit in the packet since the IPSec
   signature  would fail, or scrambling the radio waves in the case of
   wireless.

   Selecting the tree to attach to is a security critical operation

   outside of the scope of this draft. Note that the MR should not
   select a path based on trust but rather on measured service. If a
   better bandwidth is obtained via an untrusted access using IPSec,
   isn't it better than a good willing low bandwidth trusted access?

Appendix A. Optimizations

A.1 Path Optimization with RRH

   The body of the draft presents RRH as a header that circulates in the
   reverse tunnel exclusively. The RRH format by itself has no such
   limitation. This section illustrates a potential optimization for
   end-to-end traffic between a Mobile Network Node and its
   Correspondent Node.

   The MNN determines that it is part of a Mobile Network by screening
   the Tree Information option in the RA messages from its Attachment
   Router. In particular, the MNN knows the TreeDepth as advertised by
   the AR. An initial test phase could be derived from MIPv6 to decide
   whether optimization with a given CN is possible.

   When an MNN performs end-to-end optimization with a CN, the MNN
   inserts an empty RRH inside its packets, as opposed to tunneling them
   home, which is the default behavior of a Mobile Host as described in
   Section 10.

   The number of slots in the RRH is initially the AR treeDepth plus 1,
   but all slots are clear as opposed to the MR process as described in
   Section 9. The source address in the header is the MNN address, and
   the destination is the CN.

   The AR of the MNN is by definition an MR. Since an RRH is already
   present in the packet, the MR does not put the packets from the MNN
   on its reverse tunnel, but acts as an intermediate MR; it adds the
   source address of the packet (the MNN's address) in the RRH (in slot
   0) and stamps its careOf instead in the IP header source address
   field. Recursively, all the MRs on a nested network trace in path in
   the RRH and take over the source IP.

   The support required on the CN side extends MIPv6 in a way similar to
   the extension that this draft proposes for the HA side. The CN is
   required to parse the RRH when it is valid, refresh its BCE
   accordingly, and include an RH type 2 with the full path to its
   packets to the MNN.

   Note that there is no Bind Update between the MNN and the CN. The RRH
   must be secured based on tokens exchanged in the test phase. For the
   sake of security, it may be necessary to add fields to the RRH or to
   add a separate option in the Mobility Header.

A.2 Packet Size Optimization

   RRH allows to update the Correspondent BCE on a per packet basis,
   which is the highest resolution that we can achieve. While this may
   cope with highly mobile and nested configurations, it can also be an
   overkill in some situations.

   The RRH comes at a cost: it requires processing in all intermediate
   Mobile Routers and in the Correspondent Node. Also, a RRH increases
   the packet size by more than the size of an IP address per hop in the
   Mobile Network.

   This is why an additional Routing Header is proposed (type 3). The
   semantics of type 3 are very close to type 4 but:

   o  Type 3 has only one slot, for the Home Address of the source.

   o  When it can not add the source to the RH type 3 of an outbound
      packet, an intermediate MR:

      *  MR MUST NOT send ICMP (RRH too small)

      *  MUST NOT put the packet in a reverse tunnel

      Rather, it simply overwrites the source and forwards the packet up
      the tree as if the RRH had been properly updated.

   o  Since the path information is not available, the correspondent
      MUST NOT update its BCE based on the RH type 3. The CN (or HA)
      identifies the source from the entry in slot 0 and may reconstruct
      the initial packet using the CareOf in slot 1 as source for AH
      purposes.

         }
         overwrite source address in IP header with MR CareOf
         transmit packet
      }
   }


A.2.1 Routing Header Type 3 (Home Address option replacement)

   This is an RH-based alternative to the Home Address destination
   option. Its usage is described in Appendix A.2.

   The decision to send RH type 3 or type 4 is up to the source of the
   RRH. Several algorithms may apply, one out of N being the simplest.

   IPsec HA processing is done as described in Section 11.1 for Type 4.

Appendix B. Multi Homing

B.1 Multi-Homed Mobile Network

   Consider difference between situation A and B in this diagram:



                ===?==          ==?===
                  MR1            MR2

               MR3   MR4     MR5
                |     |       |
               ===   ===     ===



                ===?==          ==?===
                  MR1            MR2
                   |              |
              ==?=====?=======?======   situation B

                |     |       |
               ===   ===     ===




    Going from A to B, MR5 may now choose between MR1 and MR2 for its
   Attachment (default) Router. In terms of Tree Information, MR5, as
   well as MR3 and MR4, now sees the MR1's tree and MR2's tree. Once MR5
   selects its AR, MR2, say, MR5 belongs to the associated tree and
   whether MR1 can be reached or not makes no difference.

   As long as each MR has a single default router for all its outbound
   traffic, 2 different logical trees can be mapped over the physical
   configurations in both situations, and once the trees are
   established, both cases are equivalent for the processing of RRH.

   Note that MR5 MUST use a CareOf based on a prefix owned by its AR as
   source of the reverse tunnel, even if other prefixes are present on
   the Mobile Network, to ensure that a RH type 2 can be securely routed
   back.

B.2 Multihomed Mobile Router

   Consider the difference between situation B and C in this diagram:



                ===?==          ==?===
                  MR1            MR2
                   |              |
              ==?=====?=======?======   situation B
               MR3   MR4     MR5
                |     |       |
               ===   ===     ===


                ==? ?==
                  MR1
                   |
              ==?=====?=======?======   situation C
               MR3   MR4     MR5
                |     |       |
               ===   ===     ===



    In situation C, MR2's egress interface and its properties are
   migrated to MR1. MR1 has now 2 different Home Addresses, 2 Home
   Agents, and 2 active interfaces.

   If MR1 uses both CareOf addresses at a given point of time, and if
   they belong to different prefixes to be used via different attachment
   routers, then MR1 actually belongs to 2 trees. It must perform some
   routing logic to decide whether to forward packets on either egress
   interface. Also, it MUST advertise both tree information sets in its
   RA messages.

   The difference between situations C and B is that when an attached
   router (MR5, say) selects a tree and forwards egress packets via MR1,
   it can not be sure that MR1 will actually forward the packets over
   that tree. If MR5 has selected a given tree for a specific reason,
   then a new source route header is needed to enforce that path on MR1.

   The other way around, MR5 may leave the decision up to MR1. If MR1
   uses the same attachment router for a given flow or at least a given
   destination, then the destination receives consistent RRHs.
   Otherwise, the BCE cache will flap, but as both paths are valid, the
   traffic still makes it through.

Internet-Draft         The Reverse Routing Header          February 2004


Appendix C. Changes from Previous Version of the Draft

   From -03 to -04

      TI option: renamed the F (fixed) flag bit to G (grounded).

      Binding Update: Made clear that the BU flow conforms MIPv6 and
      Nemo but that RRH replaces both Home address Option and Alternate
      CareOf option.

   From -02 to -03

      Reworded the security part to remove an ambiguity that let the
      reader think that RRH is unsafe.

   From -01 to -02

      Made optional the usage of ICMP warning "RRH too small" (Section
      5).

      Changed the IPsec processing for Routing Header type 2 (Section
      11.1).

   From -00 to -01

      Added new Tree Information Option fields:

         A 8 bits Bandwidth indication that provides an idea of the
         egress bandwidth.

         A CRC-32 that changes with the egress path out of the tree.

         a 32 bits unsigned integer, built by each MR out of a high
         order configured preference and 24 bits random constant. This
         can help as a tie break in Attachment Router selection.

      Reduced the 'negative' part of the lollipop space to 0..255

      Fixed acknowledgements (sorry Patrick :)

      Changed the type of Tree Information Option from 7 to 10.
