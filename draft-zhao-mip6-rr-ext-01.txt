Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


1.  Motivations

   The key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD,
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in RFC2119 [1].

   MIP6 adopts Return Routability Test as a lightweight and
   infrastructure-less authentication mechanism to achieve a reasonable
   level of authentication between MN and CN even without pre-existing
   security association.  Our motivations to propose some extensions to
   the original MIP6 RR test are as follows:

   1) Location privacy

   Recently location privacy, especially in the mobile environment,
   attaches more and more attentions.  Moreover, the core idea of MIP6
   RR test can be used to enhance the security of NEMO Route
   Optimization protocol.  Although NEMO RO solution is still under
   discussion, a potential approach is to enable MR to register its
   MNP(s) with CN/CR to achieve the optimal route just like the
   procedure of Binding Updates to correspondent nodes in MIP6.  The
   privacy issue in NEMO, such as the privacy of MNP (Mobile Network
   Prefix), becomes even more serious.  In this draft, we propose to
   postpone the disclosure of HoA as late as possible by using hash
   function and even make HoA invisible to the eavesdropper in the BU
   message to CN by using encryption.

   In MIP6 RR test, HoA is in the cleartext in the HoTi decapsulated and
   forwarded by HA, HoT and BU messages to CN, thus an eavesdropper can
   learn that MN is away from the home network and even MN∆s current
   location when combining with CoA.  The location privacy can be
   protected by making either CoA (location) or HoA (identity) invisible
   to eavesdropper.  In this draft we use the latter.

   However, we focus on the privacy issues only in the RR test related
   messages (thus in the IP layer), so the privacy issues of other
   messages, such as home BU message, prefix discovery message and data
   message, are out of scope of this draft.

   2) Detection of attack

   The goal of the original MIP6 RR test is to make the MIP6 network as
   secure as the IPv6 network.  However, in MIP6, an attacker that is
   able to only eavesdrop the traffic in the IPv6 network can
   effectively intercept the traffic between MN and CN, which makes the
   MIP6 network a little bit less secure than the IPv6 network.  For
   example, if an attacker adjacent to a unmalicious router on the path
   between HA and CN can only eavesdrop the traffic but not intercept



Zhao, et al.             Expires August 25, 2005                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   the traffic passing by in the IPv6 network, he can successfully
   intercept thus take the complete control of the communication between
   MN and CN by launching the MIP6 RR test.

   In this draft we propose an efficient and effective detection
   mechanism for both CN and MN to promptly detect any attack that could
   compromise the security of MIP6 RO mechanism and thus take the
   appropriate response.  In the original MIP6 RR test, MN may detect
   the disruption of the communication by observing the traffic
   characteristics (The disruption/redirection attack is indicated by
   the time-out signal, however, MN has to wait the timer to expire.).
   Moreover, since MN does not know the root-cause of the anomaly, MN
   may have to retry for several times (for example, by re-sending the
   Binding Updates to CN) before concluding that there is either an
   attack or link failure.  In order to discover the root-cause, MN may
   also try to compare the results by using the reverse tunneling to HA.
   Thus the whole procedure is very lengthy.  On the other hand, the
   original MIP6 RR test does not provide any means for CN to detect the
   attack, thus the performance of the communication between MN and CN
   suffers since the moment when CN accepts the BU from an attacker.  We
   believe that CN is in the best position to detect the attack and the
   most effective mechanism to resist a large range of attacks and
   minimize the effects of attack has to be done on the CN side.  By
   detecting the attack promptly and taking the appropriate actions, for
   example, CN sends the packets to the home address, MN can detect the
   attack directly by observing the traffic being forwarded by HA, which
   follows a non-optimal route but is still better than the disruption
   of communication (100% packet loss).

   3) Performance improvement

   Besides the security enhancement, this detection mechanism also helps
   improve the performance by reducing the signaling overhead.

   In MIP6 RO protocol, the lifetime of Binding Cache Entry (and nonce,
   token etc.) is limited to a few minutes in order to mitigate some
   attacks, which causes a lot of signaling overheads.  With the
   detection mechanism, it is possible to lengthen the lifetime of
   Binding Cache Entry when some attacks, such as Future Address
   Stealing, are considered as the low severity.

   Another observation is that it is unnecessary to keep repeating the
   complete RR procedure if there is no attacker around, especially when
   MN still stays at the same location as before.  The by-product of
   this detection mechanism is to reduce the complete RR procedure to
   just one round trip of message exchange when the lifetime of BCE is
   about to expire and MN does not change its location, which thus
   greatly improves the performance.

   4) RR test on network prefix

   It is also our motivation to propose a MIP6 RR test mechanism that
   could be easily extended to ÙRR-testˆ Mobile Network Prefix in NEMO
   efficiently and securely once NEMO working group is re-chartered to
   work on the NEMO RO problem.

   This draft is organized as follows: in Section 2 we briefly review
   the related works and then describe the assumptions and the details
   of our proposal in Section 3 and Section 4 respectively.  In Section
   5 we present the security consideration and conclude the whole draft
   in Section 6.  Finally, we briefly discuss the applicability of these
   ideas to NEMO RR test on MNP in Appendix 1.

2.  Related Works

   MIP6 protocol [2] adopts the RR test to enable CN to authenticate the
   binding between CoA and HoA of MN in a reasonable security level when
   there is no pre-exisitng security association between CN and MN.  The
   rationale and background of this design are documented in [5].  Later
   on, a lot of enhancements of MIP6 RO and improvement of the original
   RR test are proposed in [6][7].  Those proposals are based on MIP6
   RO; however, NEMO [4] RO [10] has its own security issues.  [8]
   proposed the idea of using NPT message to verify the correctness of
   MNP; however, it not only generates the amplication effect but also
   leaves a hole for an attacker to successfully steal the traffic [9].

3.  Assumptions

   Our draft inherits all the underlying assumptions of the original
   MIP6 RR test.  Besides, we emphasis and restate the following
   assumptions:

3.1  No infrastructure support

   The extended RR test does not require PKI or AAA infrastructure to
   assist the authentication procedure and thus avoids the expensive
   public key calculation and signaling overhead due to extra message
   exchanges.

3.2  Pre-existing SA between MN and HA

   We assume that there exists a security association between MN and HA
   and the integrity and confidentiality of the messages between MN and
   HA are protected by this SA [3].

3.3  No pre-existing SA between MN and CN or between HA and CN

   We assume that there is no pre-existing SA between MN and CN or
   between HA and CN.

3.4  No ingress filtering

   Our proposal does not rely on the ingress filtering, thus we assume
   that there is no ingress filtering enforced and the attacker can even
   spoof the packets.

3.5  Unmalicious HA and CN

   We assume that HA and CN do not have any malicious intention.

   If HA is malicious, the security of MIP6 RR test is compromised.  For
   example, a malicious HA can redirect the HoT message to an attacker
   so that the attacker can successfully finish the RR procedure with CN
   and intercept the traffic to other MN; a malicious HA can also drop
   the HoTi or HoT message from or to any MN.  In [8], the same
   assumption is also held implicitly because otherwise a malicious HA
   can forward the NPT messages to the attacker or respond on behalf of
   the attacker.  Also a malicious HA can fully control the
   communication in MIP6 when MN performs the reverse tunneling.  This
   is similar with the case that the attacker has full control
   (interception) over the path between CN and HA.  The same analyses
   also apply if CN is malicious.  Thus we believe this is a valid
   assumption.

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


3.6  The power of the attacker

   We use the following two terms to describe the power of the attacker:

      Full control: the attacker can intercept, drop and of course
      eavesdrop the traffic passing by.  For example, the attacker
      controls a router in the Internet.

      Partial control: the attacker can only eavesdrop the traffic that
      can finally arrive at the intended destination successfully.

   The original MIP6 RR test limits the attack to be successful only
   when the attacker is in certain locations.  In other words, the
   security is compromised when the attacker has the following powers:
   The attacker is able to access (intercept or eavesdrop) the message
   exchanges on both MN-CN path and HA-CN path.  To do so, the attacker
   could move from one path to the other; or it could have a conspirator
   on the other path; or these two paths are kind of overlapping with
   each other and the attacker is attached to the common part of these
   two paths.

   We assume that the attacker has no full control on either MN-CN path
   or HA-CN path, but the attacker may have the partial control over
   both paths to eavesdrop the traffic passing by at the same time.

4.  Proposal

   Our discussions are based on the following simplified MIP6 scenario:
   CN is a fixed node in the Internet.  It is possible to use the
   reverse tunneling when CN is also a mobile node just like in [5], but
   we will address this case in details in the later version of this
   draft due to the constrained time frame.

   Each extension can be applied to the original MIP6 RR test as an
   independent add-on module.  Thus based on the security policy, MN and
   CN can negotiate to use one or a combination of several extensions.

4.1  Notations

   Besides those used in [2], we also defines the following notations:

      RN: a random number generated by MN with the fixed length.  In
      other words, the length of RN is pre-configured and well known by
      MN, HA, CN and/or any other node.

      HV: the output of a secure hash function, such as SHA1.

      Kha: a secret node key of HA.

4.2  Protecting the privacy of HoA in MIP6 RR test message without
    encryption

                    Figure 1: The RR test procedure

   Please note that MN should send HoTi and CoTi as soon as possible,
   even at the same time.  The figure shows that HoTi is after CoTi just
   because of the convenience of drawing.

   When MN moves to a new location other than its home network, MN may
   decide to start the RR procedure with remote node, CN, as follows.

   HoTi:

   o  Source IP address: HoA

   o  Destination IP address: CN

   o  {home_init_cookie | RN}

   MN generates the HoTi message and forwards it into the reverse MN-HA
   tunnel, thus the confidentiality and the secrecy of HoTi are
   protected by SA between MN and HA.

   After HA receives and verifies the HoTi message successfully, HA will
   generate the following HoTi_HA message and forward it to CN.  Note
   that HoTi_HA message can use the same MH type value for HoTi message
   because this transformation is transparent to CN.  We give a
   different name to the HoTi_HA message in order to highlight their
   differences.

   HoTi_HA:

   o  Source IP address: HA

   o  Destination IP address: CN

   o  {home_init_ha_cookie | HV} where HV = SHA1 (HoA | RN)

   Please note that HA replaces the source IP address, HoA, with its own
   IP address, HA and replaces home_init_cookie with
   home_init_ha_cookie.  While there are several ways to generate
   home_init_ha_cookie, we simply generate it by a Random Number
   Generator (RNG).  Then HA establishes a table where
   home_init_ha_cookie, HoA and home_init_cookie are stored in one entry
   and home_init_ha_cookie is a primary key.  Please note that HA
   creates the table entry only after it verifies the received packet
   from MN, thus it does not risk the Denial-of-Service attack at this
   stage.  Later, when HA receives the HoT packet that seems like from
   CN, HA just needs to perform the table lookup operation to verify the
   cookie.  The management of this table does not result in too much
   extra cost because HA needs to remember the recent home_init_cookie
   in the original MIP6 RR test anyway.  However if HA still concerns
   about the memory cost, HA can generate home_init_ha_cookie by
   AES(Kha, HoA | home_init_cookie) and only need to remember 1)
   home_init_ha_cookie or 2) the output of a hash function over
   home_init_ha_cookie or 3) even nothing.  In 1) and 2) memory cost is



Zhao, et al.             Expires August 25, 2005               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   reduced at a cost of decryption and/or hash computation and the
   Denial-of-Service attack for HA is mitigated by firstly verifying the
   received home_init_ha_cookie in the HoT message that seems from CN.
   However, in 3) Denial-of-Service attack may become a serious threat
   when HA later decrypts the payload to restore HoA and
   home_init_cookie.  Although the time spent on the decryption may not
   be as much as one thought because AES is done over a short payload
   (the concatenation of HoA and home_init_cookie), HA should take all
   these factors in considerations and balance the cost between memory
   and computation to minimize the threats.

   After CN receives HoTi_HA message, CN generates the HoT message.
   Note that the formula to generate home_token takes HV as input as
   well.

   HoT:

   o  Source IP address: CN

   o  Destination IP address: HA

   o  {home_init_ha_cookie | home_token | home_nonce_index}

   o  home_token = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kcn, (HV | home_nonce | 0)))

   After HA receives HoT message, HA looks up the table with
   home_init_ha_cookie as the primary key or decrypts the
   home_init_ha_cookie.  After successfully achieving HoA and
   home_init_cookie, HA generates the following HoT_HA message and
   forwards it to MN through the MN-HA tunnel.

   HoT_HA:

   o  Source IP address: CN

   o  Destination IP address: HoA

   o  {home_init_cookie | home_token | home_nonce_index}

   o  home_token = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kcn, (HV | home_nonce | 0)))

   Please note that HoT_HA message can use the same MH type value for
   HoT message because this transformation is transparent to MN.  We
   give a different name to the HoT_HA message in order to highlight
   their differences.

   MN generates the CoTi message and sends it directly to CN.  Note that
   CoTi carries HV instead of HoA in the cleartext in [7].

   CoTi:

   o  Source IP address: CoA

   o  Destination IP address: CN

   o  {careof_init_cookie | HV}

   o  HV = SHA1 (HoA | RN) where RN is the same random number used in
      the HoTi message.

   After CN receives CoTi message, CN generates the CoT message.  Note
   that the formula to generate careof_token takes HV as input as well.

   CoT:

   o  Source IP address: CN

   o  Destination IP address: CoA

   o  {careof_init_cookie | careof_token | careof_nonce_index}

   o  careof_token = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kcn, (CoA | HV | careof_nonce
      | 1)))

   The binding management key, Kbm, is generated by taking the
   concatenation of home_token and careof_token as input of SHA1.

   Kbm = SHA1(home_token | careof_token)

   MN generates the BU message as follows and sends it to CN.

   BU:

   o  Source IP address: CoA

   o  Destination IP address: CN

   o  {HoA | seq | home_nonce_index | careof_nonce_index | RN | MAC}

   the Binding Acknowledgement, CN generates the BA message based on the
   verification result.

   BA:

   o  Source IP address: CN

   o  Destination IP address: CoA

   o  {seq | HV | MAC}

   o  MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BA)))

4.3  Protection of the HoA privacy in the BU message

   The binding management key, Kbm, and the encryption key, Ken, are
   generated as follows.

      Kbm = SHA1(home_token | careof_token | 0)

      Ken = SHA1(home_token | careof_token | 1)

   BU:

   o  Source IP address: CoA

   o  Destination IP address: CN

   o  {seq | home_nonce_index | careof_nonce_index | HV | ENC | MAC}

   o  ENC = AES (Ken, HoA | RN)

   o  MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BU)))

   After CN receives the BU message, CN firstly generates Kbm and Ken,
   then verifies MAC and decrypts ENC.  Assume that what CN gets is HoA∆
   and RN∆, CN will verify whether HV is equal to SHA1 (HoA∆ | RN∆).  If
   the BA message is requested, CN generates the following one based on
   the verification result.

   BA:

   o  Source IP address: CN

   o  Destination IP address: CoA

   o  {seq | HV | MAC}

   o  MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BA)))

   Please note that the decryption operation is after the verification
   succeeds, which is necessary to reduce the risk of Denial-of-Service
   attack.  Please note that the time spent on the decryption might be
   not as much as one thought because AES is done over a short payload
   (the concatenation of HoA and RN).  Although an attacker on the HA-CN
   path can still pass the MAC verification and make CN spend resources
   on the decryption operation, a detection mechanism can be used to
   detect this kind of attack as shown below.

4.4  Extending the RR test with a detection mechanism

   The original MIP6 RR test allows an attacker to intercept the traffic
   even though this attacker is only able to eavesdrop the traffic in
   the IPv6 network, which makes the MIP6 network slightly less secure
   than the IPv6 network.  In order to provide better security together
   with other performance benefits, we propose a simple but effective
   detection mechanism to enable CN to detect the attack promptly and
   take the appropriate response when the power of attacker can
   compromise the security of the original MIP6 RR test.  The core idea
   is that either a valid MN or an attacker must provide the
   cryptographically sound proof of the previous successful Binding
   Update to CN if any, before a new Binding Update is accepted by CN.
   If the correctness of this proof cannot be verified by CN, CN
   disables the relevant Binding Update Cache entry and forwards the
   data packet to its home address instead.

   We adopt one-way hash chain to accomplish that.  While we have
   considered using other kinds of one-way hash chain (or tree) as well,
   in this draft we focus our discussions on the following one:

   MN wants to a chain of length k.  Firstly, it generates a random
   number h_k and then repeatedly applies the one-way hash function, H.
   For example, h_k-1=H(h_k), h_k-2=H(h_k-1), ‡, h_0=H(h_1).  This
   one-way hash chain has the following properties: MN reveals the
   elements of the chain in the order of h_0, h_1, ‡, h_k to CN.  Even
   though the attacker eavesdrops h_i in this chain, it is still
   cryptographically impossible for him to derive h_j from h_i where
   j>i.  On the contrary, any one can easily confirm that h_j is part of
   the chain if h_i=H(h_j)^(j-i) where j>i.  MN can create the chain all
   at once and store each element of the chain, or just store h_k
   together with the sequence number of the next element in the chain
   and generate the element on demand.  There exist other approaches
   that can help reduce storage cost with a small recomputation penalty.
   (It is possible to use log(k) storage and log(k) computation to
   access an element.) The development of technology is also expected to
   meet the increasing requirement of battery and memory for MN to



Zhao, et al.             Expires August 25, 2005               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   maintain such kind of one-way hash chain.  Please note that MN
   maintains a hash chain for each pair of <HoA, CN> so that MN can use
   multiple HoAs to communicate with different CN.

   Notations:

      h_seq: the current element in the one-way hash chain.

      seq: the sequence number of this element in the one-way hash
      chain.

   MN generates the BU message as follows and sends it to CN.

   BU:

   o  Source IP address: CoA

   o  Destination IP address: CN

   o  {HoA | seq | home_nonce_index | careof_nonce_index | RN | h_seq |
      MAC}

   o  MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BU)))

   When CN receives the BU message, CN firstly calculates HV based on
   HoA and RN, then generates Kbm and verifies the MAC.  If the result
   is positive, CN performs the following procedure to verify h_seq:

   1.  Search the Binding Update Cache by using MN∆s HoA as the primary
       key.

   2.  If it does exist, CN verifies h_seq in the BU message with the
       old hash chain element, h_seq∆ stored in the Binding Updates
       Cache as follows:

       1.  If seq∆ >= seq, discard the BU message because it is a
           replayed message.

       2.  If seq∆ < seq and h_seq∆=H(h_seq)^(seq-seq∆), CN believes
           this BU message is correct, thus it updates the Binding Cache
           Entry with h_seq and then sends the Binding Acknowledgement
           message if requested.

       3.  If seq∆ < seq and h_seq∆ <> H(h_seq)^(seq-seq∆), CN realizes
           that there is an attacker that can successfully finish the
           extended RR test; however, CN is not sure whether this BU
           message is from the attacker or a valid MN based on its
           current knowledge.  Thus CN disables this entry, indicates



Zhao, et al.             Expires August 25, 2005               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


           the reason in the BA message and forwards the data packets to
           the home address.  CN∆s policy may decide to accept the new
           BU message for this HoA when the current session with this
           HoA is ended or after a certain amount of time.

   3.  If it does not exist, CN accepts the BU message and creates a new
       Binding Update Cache Entry and forwards the data packets destined
       to this HoA based on MIP6 RO protocol.

   The hash chain can be depleted after a long time use.  MN can update
   the hash chain information in CN by starting a complete RR test and
   sending the last element in the old hash chain together with the
   first element in the new hash chain in the BU message.

   The hash chain information should not be lost due to the reboot in CN
   and MN.  While it is not a big problem for CN as it is just a fresh
   start, it is better for MN to store the hash chain information in the
   hard disk so that the synchronization between MN and CN can be
   restored.

   CN must verify the hash chain element in the BU message even if seq
   is not consecutive in order to recover from the BU packet loss due to
   the network congestion.  However the difference between the new seq
   and the old seq should not be more than the number of retries when MN
   experiences the packet loss.

   If MN requests the Binding Acknowledgement, CN generates the BA
   message based on the verification result.

   BA:

   o  Source IP address: CN

   o  Destination IP address: CoA

   o  {seq | HV | MAC}

   o  MAC = First (128, HMAC_SHA1(Kbm, (CoA | CN | BA)))

   Please note that this detection mechanism is independent from the
   location privacy mechanism, thus the privacy of HoA can be also
   protected by encryption just like in the previous section.  CN needs
   to verify the hash chain element after the decryption.

4.5  Lengthening the lifetime of BCE

   Given the strong detection mechanism, it is possible to lengthen the
   lifetime of BCE in order to reduce the frequency of RR test.  One of



Zhao, et al.             Expires August 25, 2005               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   dangers to do so is the future address stealing attack, which is
   similar with the reflector-based flooding attack and can be easily
   detected by MN.  Thus if there is no such attack detected by MN, MN
   can benefit from the lengthened BCE lifetime; otherwise, MN needs the
   help from the upstream router to filter the unwanted traffic, maybe
   in a way similar with pushback, which is out of the scope of this
   draft.  More examinations on the Pros and Cons of lengthening the
   lifetime of BCE are still needed.

4.6  Fast BU refreshment

   When the lifetime of one binding cache entry is about to expire or MN
   receives the Binding Refresh Request message from CN, if MN does not
   change its location, MN can send the following BU message to CN:

   BU:

   o  Source IP address: CoA

   o  Destination IP address: CN

   o  {seq | HV | h_seq}

   o  where HV = SHA1(HoA)

   When CN receives it, it uses HV to looks up the Binding Cache that is
   extended to include HV as a field in each entry.  If there exists an
   entry, CN compares the received CoA with that in the entry.  If it
   matches, CN verifies h_seq as described before.  If everything is
   correct, CN generates the following BA message if requested:

   BA:

   o  Source IP address: CN

   o  Destination IP address: CoA

   o  {seq | HV}

   o  where where HV = SHA1(HoA | h_seq)

   When MN receives the BA message, MN generates SHA1(HoA | h_seq) and
   then compares it with HV.  If HoA is not disclosed, then it is
   cryptographically impossible for an eavesdropper to generate SHA1(HoA
   | h_seq) based on SHA1(HoA) and h_seq, thus MN can believe this BA
   message is really from CN that gains the knowledge about HoA from the
   complete RR procedure that MN did with CN before.

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   Please note that if using the method above it is required to protect
   the privacy of HoA in the data message as well.  It is possible to
   use SHA1(HoA) instead of HoA in the data packet; however, the details
   will be discussed in the future version.  If MN does not worry about
   the location privacy, it can just use HoA in the BU message rather
   than HV.  Please note that the Binding Acknowledgement message is
   optional in the original MIP6 RR test anyway, the forged Binding
   Acknowledgement message may result in a non-optimal route in the
   worst case but not disruption.

4.7  Non-repudiation

   It seems that the only way to provide the non-repudiation of HA or CN
   is to use the public key.  Our RR test can be extended to achieve the
   repudiation if the public keys of HA and/or CN are available.  The
   details of this extension are skipped because it is equivalent to say
   that there exists the trust relationship between HA and CN.
   Moreover, instead of using public key every time when launching the
   RR test, we can use public key authentication only at the first time
   and then use the hash chain in the following RR test session to
   reduce the computation cost.

5.  Security consideration

5.1  The privacy of HoA

   The privacy of HoA is protected as much as possible.  Using the hash
   value of HoA instead of HoA in the cleartext not only makes the
   leakage of HoA cryptographically impossible but also help shorten the
   length of message, simplify the task to design and parse message
   format as the length of a hash function output is fixed.  Moreover,
   we append a random number to HoA before performing the hash function
   in order to make it difficult for the attacker to derive HoA because
   HA∆s address shares the same network prefix with HoA mostly.  Without
   this random number, the attacker may need less computation to acquire
   HoA.

   Please note that privacy is secondary compared with authentication
   because if an attacker can break the authentication of the RR test,
   the privacy of HoA is also compromised.

5.2  Denial-of-Service attack

   Security comes with costs.  We carefully design the protocol in order
   to minimize the risk of Denial-of-Service attack against MN, CN or
   HA.

5.2.1  Decryption

   It is possible that the attacker can launch the DoS attack by making
   CN/HA busy with decryption, however it requires the attacker to forge
   the BU message with the correct MAC and hash chain element or to
   provide the correct cookie.  Because AES is done over a short payload
   (For example, the total length of HoA and RN is only 32 bytes.), the
   time to encrypt/decrypt by AES may not be as much as one thought.

5.2.2  Hash chain verification

   The attacker may want to launch the DoS attack by making CN spend a
   lot of time on the verification of hash chain element.  For example,
   if the current hash chain element is h_i, the attacker sends one BU
   message with h_j where j>>i.  CN may set the upper bound of the
   difference between j and i, which is also the number of retries when
   the BU message is lost during the transmission.  If j is too large,
   CN may refuse the BU message according to its policy.

5.3  Prevention of traffic interception

   The attacker only being able to eavesdrop on both MN-CN and HA-CN
   path cannot intercept the traffic that is intended to a specific MN



Zhao, et al.             Expires August 25, 2005               [Page 19]

Internet-Draft             MIP6 RR Extensions              February 2005


   when the detection mechanism is in use.

5.4  Other attacks described in [7]

   The attacks described in [7] do not succeed in our RR test.  For the
   session hijacking attacks in section 3.1, although the attacker can
   learn the home_token, however, it does not know HoA, so the attacker
   cannot generate the correct BU message.  If the attacker has its
   conspirator on the MN-CN path, since its conspirator cannot intercept
   the message, it cannot stop MN from finishing the RR test with CN.
   Together with the detection mechanism, the traffic cannot be
   hijacked.  For the Movement Halting attacks in section 3.2, when the
   attacker is able to know home_token and careof_token in the different
   sessions but from one single MN, the attacker must have to learn HoA
   from the BU message.  If the BU message is encrypted, the attack
   fails if the attacker cannot monitor both paths simultaneously.  If
   the BU message is not encrypted, the attack still fails when the
   detection mechanism is used.  For the traffic permutation attacks in
   section 3.3, the attacker is able to know multiple home_tokens and
   multiple careof_tokens in the different sessions from multiple
   different MNs.  However, since both home_token and careof_token are
   generated from the hash output of HoA, CN can detect the forged BU
   message using mixed home_token and careof_token.  Again the detection
   mechanism can detect this attack as well.

   Using the hash output of HoA only prevents the attack targeting at a
   specific MN and the attacker has no knowledge of HoA associated with
   this MN.  But the attacker on the HA-CN path is free to launch the RR
   test for any HoA it chooses as long as it is on the path from CN to
   this home network.  Again, this attack can be detected by the
   detection mechanism.

   The extended RR test supports the fast Binding Updates procedure in
   CN, which is especially useful when MN moves from one location to
   another frequently.  When MN moves to a new location, MN can reuse
   the home_token received at the previous location as long as
   home_token is still valid, thus MN saves the home test procedure that
   is usually longer than the careof test since HoTi and HoT messages
   have to go through HA firstly.

6.  Conclusions

   In this draft, we propose several extensions to the original MIP6 RR
   test.  Our proposal protects the location privacy and enables CN and
   MN to promptly detect the attack, thus it achieves better security
   and performance.

Appendix A.  Return Routability Test on Network Prefix (RRNP) in NEMO

   We limit our discussion in this draft in such a simplified NEMO
   scenario: 1) CN/CR is a fixed node in the Internet.  2) MR is not in
   the nested NEMO network, instead it attaches to the Internet
   directly.

   Generally speaking, we expect that the RR test on network prefix
   (RRNP) in NEMO makes the NEMO network as secure as the MIP6/IPv6
   network.  Especially, the leakage of MNP information in NEMO does not
   affect just one simple host as in MIP6 but a whole network, thus we
   expect to protect the privacy of MNP during the RRNP procedure, which
   is accomplished by applying hash function and encryption over the MNP
   information.  There are following advantages by using hash function
   over MNP information alone: 1) The privacy of MNP is protected and
   the disclosure of MNP is postponed as late as possible.  2) It does
   not limit the number or source of MNP(s) owned by MR.  Instead, MR
   could own arbitrary number of MNPs from one or even multiple
   different home networks while the length of message is shortened and
   the task to design and parse message format is simplified as the
   length of a hash function output is fixed.  3) The attacks described
   in [7] are defeated while still making the fast Binding Update
   possible.

   We also avoid using multiple NPT messages to test the correctness of
   MNP.  Instead, we depend on HA to actively verify the MNP information
   in the HoTi message.  The reasons are as follows:

      1) HA knows the MNP(s) associated with MR implicitly or explicitly
      before the RRNP test.  This is similar with implicit mode and
      explicit mode in NEMO Basic Support Protocol.  For example, there
      is manual configuration at HA mapping the MNP to MR∆s HoA, so HA
      knows the MNP associated with MR implicitly.  On the other hand,
      MR may inform HA about the MNP information explicitly by the Home
      Binding Update procedure and then start the RRNP test.  Either
      way, HA can verify the MNP information in the RRNP message
      correctly.  (Note that in the explicit mode, the MNP information
      in the RRNP message must match that in the Home Binding Update
      message.)

      2) HA should not have any malicious intention to CN/CR and MR as
      we discuss before.

   Hash chain can also be integrated into the RRNP test to detect the
   attack.
