Internet-Draft    Media Description for IKE in the SDP         July 2008


Abstract

   This document extends the protocol identifier of SDP so that it could
   negotiate the use of IKE for media session in SDP offer/answer model.
   And it also specifies the method to boot up IKE and generate IPsec SA
   using self-signed certificate under the mechanism of comedia-tls.
   This document extends RFC 4572.  In addition, it defines a new
   attribute "udp-setup", which is similar to "setup" attribute defined
   in RFC 4145, to enable endpoints to negotiate their roles in the IKE
   session.  Considering the case that pre-shared keys can be used for
   authentication in IKE, a new attribute "psk-fingerprint" is also
   defined.

Internet-Draft    Media Description for IKE in the SDP         July 2008


1.  Introduction

   In this section, the background of the problem in accessing home
   network which this document tries to solve, and the approach to the
   solution are described.

1.1.  Problem Statement

   When a device outside the home network connects to another device
   inside the home network, it often becomes a problem to traverse a NAT
   (Network Address Translation) device between them.  One of the
   effective solutions for this problem is VPN remote access to the NAT
   device, usually a home router.  With this approach, once the external
   device participates in the home network securely, it will be easy to
   establish connections with all the devices inside the home.  On the
   other hand, there are more difficult cases that a home router itself
   is located inside the NAT.  In such cases, it is also necessary to
   consider NAT traversal of the remote access to the home router.  In
   any cases, because a global IP address of the home router is not
   always fixed, it is necessary to make use of an effective name
   resolution mechanism.

   In addition, there is a problem how a remote client and a home router
   authenticate each other over IKE [RFC4306] which establishes IPsec
   [RFC4301] for remote access.  It wouldn't be always possible that
   both parties exchange a pre-shared key securely in advance.  It would
   be also impractical to distribute authentication certificates signed
   by well-known root certification authority (CA) to all the devices
   because of their cost and administrative overhead, and after all, it
   is inefficient to publish a temporary certificate to the device which
   does not have a fixed IP address or hostname.  Therefore, if it is
   possible to use a self-signed certificate for authentication
   securely, that will be one of the effective solutions in this case.

1.2.  Approach to Solution

   In this document, we propose to use SIP [RFC3261] as a name
   resolution and authentication mechanism to initiate an IKE session.
   There are three main advantages to use SIP as follows.

   o  Delegation of Authentication to Third Party
      By taking advantage of the authentication and authorization
      mechanisms which SIP already has, the devices can be free from
      managing signed certificates and their whitelists.

   o  UDP Hole Punching for IKE/IPsec
      SIP has a cross-nat rendezvous mechanism such as ICE
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice].  This effective function can be used for



Saito & Wing            Expires January 28, 2009                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Media Description for IKE in the SDP         July 2008


      general applications as well as real-time media.  It is difficult
      to setup the session between devices without SIP if they are
      inside various types of NAT.

   o  Reuse of Existing SIP Infrastructure
      SIP servers are widely distributed as a scalable infrastructure,
      and it is quite reasonable to reuse them without any
      modifications.

   Today, SIP is applied to not only VoIP but also various applications
   and recognized as a general protocol for session initiation.
   Therefore, it can be used to initiate IKE/IPsec sessions, too.

   On the other hand, there is also a specification which uses a self-
   signed certificate for authentication in the SIP/SDP [RFC4566]
   framework.  Comedia-tls [RFC4572] specifies the method to exchange a
   fingerprint of self-signed certificate to establish a TLS [RFC4346]
   connection.  This specification defines a mechanism that allows self-
   signed certificates can be used securely, provided that the integrity
   of the SDP description is assured.  Because a certificate itself can
   be used for authentication not only in TLS but also in IKE, this
   mechanism will be applied to the establishment of IPsec SA by
   extending the protocol identifier of SDP so that it could specify
   IKE.

   One of the easy methods to protect the integrity of SDP description,
   which is the premise of this spec, is to use SIP identity [RFC4474]
   mechanism.  This approach is also referred in
   [I-D.fischl-sipping-media-dtls].  Because SIP identity mechanism can
   protect the integrity of a body part as well as the value of From
   header in a SIP request by a valid Identity header, the receiver of
   the request can establish the secure IPsec connections with the
   sender by confirming that the hash value of the certificate sent
   during IKE negotiation matches the fingerprint in the SDP.  Although
   SIP identity does not protect the identity of the receiver of the SIP
   request, SIP connected identity [RFC4916] does it.

   Considering above background, this document defines new media formats
   "ike-esp" and "ike-esp-udpencap" which can be used when the protocol
   identifier is "UDP" to enable the negotiation of using IKE for media
   session over SDP exchange on condition that the integrity of SDP
   description is assured.  And it also specifies the method to setup
   IPsec SA by exchanging fingerprints of self-signed certificates based
   on comedia-tls, and notes the example of SDP offer/answer [RFC3264]
   and the points which implementation should take care.  Because there
   is a chance that devices are inside NAT, it also covers the method to
   combine IKE/IPsec NAT-Traversal [RFC3947][RFC3948] with ICE.  In
   addition, it defines an attribute "udp-setup" for UDP media sessions,

   similar to the "setup" attribute for TCP-based media transport
   defined in RFC 4145 [RFC4145].  It is used to negotiate the role of
   each endpoint in the IKE session.

1.3.  Alternative Solution under Prior Relationship between Two Nodes

   Under quite limited conditions, certificates signed by trusted third
   parties or pre-shared keys between endpoints could be used for
   authentication in IKE, with using SIP servers only for name
   resolution and authorization of session initiation.  We address such
   limited cases in chapter 7.

2.  Protocol Overview

   As shown in Figure 1, for example, there is a case of VPN remote
   access from a device outside the home to the home router whose IP
   address is not fixed.  In this case, the external device, a remote
   client recognizes Address of Record of the home router, but does not
   have any information about its contact address and certificate.
   Generally, it is difficult to establish IPsec SA dynamically and
   securely in this situation.  However as specified in comedia-tls, if
   the integrity of SDP session descriptions is assured, it is possible
   for the home router and the remote client to have a prior
   relationship with each other by exchanging certificate fingerprints,
   secure one-way hashes of the DER (distinguished encoding rules) form
   of the certificates.

   3.  After SDP exchange, Remote Client (SDP offerer) initiates IKE
       with the SDP answerer to establish IPsec SA.  Both the offerer
       and the answerer validate that the certificate presented in the
       IKE exchange has a fingerprint that matches the fingerprint from
       SDP.  If they match, IKE negotiation proceeds as normal.

   used for authentication in IKE, but SDP itself is not concerned with
   all the negotiations related to key-exchange such as those of
   encryption and authentication algorithms.  These negotiations are up
   to IKE.  And in many cases that IPsec is used for remote access, a
   remote client needs to obtain a private address inside the home
   network dynamically while initiating the remote access, therefore
   IPsec security policy also needs to be set dynamically at the same
   time.  However, such a management function of security policy is on
   the responsibility of the high-level application.  SDP is not
   concerned with it.  The roles of SDP here are to determine the IP
   addresses of both parties used for IKE connection with c-line in SDP,
   and exchange fingerprints of certificates used for authentication in
   IKE with fingerprint attribute in SDP.

   If the high-level application thinks a VPN session as the media
   session, it MAY discard the IPsec SA and terminate IKE when that
   media session is terminated by BYE request.  Therefore the
   application MUST NOT send a BYE request as long as it needs the IPsec
   SA.  By the way, each party can cache the certificate of the other
   party as described in Security Consideration of comedia-tls.

   The above example is for tunnel mode IPsec used for remote access,
   but the actual usage of negotiated IPsec is not limited.  For
   example, IKE can negotiate transport mode IPsec to encrypt multiple
   media sessions between two parties with only a pair of IPsec security
   associations.  Only one thing that SDP offer/answer model is
   responsible for is to exchange the fingerprints of certificates used
   for IKE, therefore, it does not take care of security policy.

3.  Protocol Identifiers

   This document defines new media format descriptions "ike-esp" and
   "ike-esp-udpencap", which can be used when the protocol identifier is
   "UDP" and indicate that the described media are IKE and IPsec coming
   after it.  Both offerer and answerer can negotiate IKE by specifying
   "UDP" in the "proto" field and "ike-esp" or "ike-esp-udpencap" in the
   "fmt" field in SDP. "ike-esp" denotes the normal IKE process and
   IPsec ESP [RFC4303], while "ike-esp-udpencap" does the process of
   IPsec NAT-Traversal that is specified in RFC3947 and RFC3948.

   In addition, this document defines a new attribute "udp-setup", which
   can be used when the protocol identifier is "UDP" and the "fmt" field
   is "ike-esp" or "ike-esp-udpencap", in order to describe how
   endpoints should perform the IKE session setup procedure.  The "udp-
   setup" attribute indicates which of the end points should initiate
   the IKE session establishment.  The "udp-setup" attribute is charset-
   independent and can be a session-level or a media-level attribute.
   The following is the ABNF of the "udp-setup" attribute.

      udp-setup-attr = "a=udp-setup:" role
      role           = "active" / "passive" / "actpass"

      'active'  : The endpoint will initiate an outgoing session.
      'passive' : The endpoint will accept an incoming session.
      'actpass' : The endpoint is willing to accept an incoming
                  session or to initiate an outgoing session.

   As defined in 4.1 of RFC 4145, both endpoints negotiate the value of
   "udp-setup" using the offer/answer model.  However, "holdconn"
   defined in RFC 4145 is not defined here because UDP doesn't establish
   a connection.

      Offer       Answer
      ----------------------------
      active      passive
      passive     active
      actpass     active / passive

   The semantics of "active", "passive", and "actpass" in the offer/
   answer exchange is the same as the definition described in 4.1 of RFC
   4145.  The default value of the udp-setup attribute is "active" in
   the offer and "passive" in the answer.

4.  Example of SDP Offer and Answer Exchange without IPsec NAT-Traversal

   If IPsec NAT-Traversal is not necessary, SDP negotiation to setup IKE
   is quite simple.  The example of SDP exchange is as follows.

   (Note: due to RFC formatting conventions, this document splits SDP
   across lines whose content would exceed 72 characters.  A backslash
   character marks where this line folding has taken place.  This
   backslash and its trailing CRLF and whitespace would not appear in
   actual SDP content.)

   offer SDP
      ...
      m=application 500 UDP ike-esp
      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.10
      a=udp-setup:active
      a=fingerprint:SHA-1 \
      4A:AD:B9:B1:3F:82:18:3B:54:02:12:DF:3E:5D:49:6B:19:E5:7C:AB
      ...

   answer SDP
      ...
      m=application 500 UDP ike-esp
      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.20
      a=udp-setup:passive
      a=fingerprint:SHA-1 \
      D2:9F:6F:1E:CD:D3:09:E8:70:65:1A:51:7C:9D:30:4F:21:E4:4A:8E
      ...

   Following comedia-tls specification, the fingerprint attribute may be
   either a session-level or a media-level SDP attribute.  If it is a
   session-level attribute, it applies to all IKE sessions and TLS
   sessions for which no media-level fingerprint attribute is defined.

   By the way, it is possible that an offerer becomes IKE responder and
   an answerer becomes IKE initiator.  For example, when RAS server
   sends INVITE to RAS client, the server may expect the client to
   become an IKE initiator.  In this case, the server sends offer SDP
   with udp-setup:passive and the client sends back answer SDP with udp-
   setup:active as follows.

   offer SDP
      ...
      m=application 500 UDP ike-esp
      c=IN IP4 192.0.2.10

5.  Example of SDP Offer and Answer Exchange with IPsec NAT-Traversal

   If either of endpoints that negotiate IKE is inside the NAT, they
   need to transmit both IKE and IPsec packets over NAT.  That mechanism
   is specified in RFC3947 and RFC3948 that both endpoints encapsulate
   IPsec-ESP packets with UDP header and multiplex them into the UDP
   session which IKE generates.  On the other hand, they also need to
   decide their transport addresses (combination of IP address and port)
   before starting IKE making use of ICE framework.  In this chapter, a
   method to coordinate IPsec NAT-Traversal and ICE is described.

5.1.  Port Usage

   IKE uses local UDP port 500 in general, but IPsec NAT-Traversal spec
   requires the port transition to UDP port 4500 during IKE negotiation
   because there is a possible problem that IPsec-aware NAT would
   derive.  This transition imposes ICE to generate an additional UDP
   session soon after the first IKE starts, and it would be an
   inefficient overhead.  However, IPsec NAT-Traversal allows IKE
   session to use local UDP port 4500 from the beginning.  Therefore the
   endpoints SHOULD use their local UDP port 4500 for IKE session from
   the beginning because when they are ready to use ICE, they should
   also be ready to use IPsec NAT-Traversal.

   When using ICE, a responder's IKE port observed by an initiator is
   not necessarily 500 or 4500.  Therefore, IKE initiator MUST allow any
   destination ports in addition to 500 and 4500 for the IKE packets
   which itself sends.

5.2.  Offer and Answer Exchange with ICE

   We consider the following scenario here.

                         +---------------------+

                     Figure 2: NAT-Traversal Scenario

   As shown above, an offerer is on the Internet but an answerer is
   inside the NAT.  The offerer cannot initiate IKE session unless the
   answerer prepares a global routable transport address which accepts
   IKE packets.  In this case, the following offer/answer exchange will
   take place.

   Conformed to ICE, they start STUN [I-D.ietf-behave-rfc3489bis]
   connectivity check after SDP exchange.  Then the offerer initiates
   the IKE session making use of UDP session generated by STUN packets.
   In addition, UDP encapsulated ESP packets are multiplexed into the
   same UDP session as IKE.  Thus it is necessary to multiplex the
   different three packets, STUN, IKE, and UDP-encapsulated ESP into the
   same UDP session.

5.3.  Multiplex of UDP Messages

   As described above, STUN, IKE, and UDP-encapsulated ESP packets are
   multiplexed into the same UDP session.  This section describes how to
   demultiplex these three packets.

Internet-Draft    Media Description for IKE in the SDP         July 2008


   At the first step, the endpoint which received a UDP packet at the
   multiplexed port MUST check the first 32 bits of UDP payload.  If
   they are all 0, which is defined as non-ESP marker, that packet MUST
   be treated as an IKE packet.

   Otherwise it is judged as an ESP packet in IPsec NAT-Traversal spec,
   however it is furthermore necessary to distinguish STUN from ESP.
   Therefore the bits 32-64 from the beginning of the UDP payload MUST
   be checked.  If it doesn't match the magic cookie of STUN 0x2112A442
   (most packets don't match), it is treated as an ESP packet because it
   is no longer a STUN packet.

   However if it matches the magic cookie, an additional test is
   necessary to determine it is STUN or ESP.  The magic cookie field of
   STUN overlaps the sequence number filed of ESP, so there still
   remains a possibility that the sequence number of ESP coincides with
   0x2112A442.  In this additional test, the validity of the fingerprint
   attribute of STUN message MUST be checked.  If there is a valid
   fingerprint in the message, it is judged as a STUN packet, otherwise
   it is an ESP packet.

   The above logic is expressed as follows.

      if SPI-field-is-all-zeros
           { packet is IKE }
        else
           {
           if bits-32-through-64 == stun-magic-cookie-value and
              bits-0-through-1 == 0 and
              bits-2-through-15 == a STUN message type and
              bits-16-through-32 == length of this UDP packet
              {
               fingerprint_found == parse_for_stun_fingerprint();
               if fingerprint_found == 1
                  { packet is STUN }
               else
                  { packet is ESP }
              }
           else
              { packet is ESP }
           }

6.  Application to IKE

   After sharing fingerprints of both parties securely over the SDP
   exchange, the IKE initiator MAY start the IKE session to the other
   party.  To follow this specification, digital signature MUST be
   chosen as an authentication method in IKE phase 1.  In this process,
   certificate whose hashed value matches the fingerprint exchanged over
   SDP MUST be used.  If the certificate used in IKE does not match the
   original fingerprint, the endpoint MUST terminate the IKE session
   with detecting an authentication failure.

   In addition, each party MUST present a certificate and be
   authenticated by each other.

7.  Specifications Assuming Prior Relationship between Two Nodes

   This section describes the specification for the limited cases such
   that certificates signed by trusted third parties or pre-shared keys
   between endpoints can be used for authentication in IKE.  Because
   endpoints already have a prior relationship between them in this
   case, they use SIP servers just for name resolution and
   authorization.  However, even in this case, the integrity of SDP
   description MUST be assured.

7.1.  Certificates Signed by Trusted Third Party

   The protocol overview in this case is the same as in chapter 2.  SDP
   offer/answer procedure is also the same as in chapter 4 and 5.  Both
   endpoints have a prior relationship through the trusted third
   parties, and SIP servers are used for name resolution and
   authorization of session initiation.  Even so, they MAY exchange
   fingerprints in the SDP because one device can have several
   certificates and it would be necessary to specify in advance which
   certificate will be used for the following IKE authentication.  By
   this process, authorization in SIP and authentication in IKE become
   consistent with each other.  The following figure shows VPN remote
   access from a device outside the home to the home router whose IP
   address is not fixed (same as chapter 2).

                   REGISTRATION  +----------+  REGISTRATION

   1.  Both Remote Client and Home Router generate secure signaling
       channels.  They may REGISTER to SIP Proxy using TLS.

   2.  Both Remote Client (SDP offerer) and Home Router (SDP answerer)
       exchange the fingerprints of their certificates signed by trusted
       third parties in SDP during an INVITE transaction.

   3.  After SDP exchange, Remote Client (SDP offerer) initiates IKE
       with the SDP answerer to establish IPsec SA.  Both the offerer
       and the answerer validate that the signed certificate presented
       in the IKE exchange has a fingerprint that matches the
       fingerprint from SDP.  If they match, IKE negotiation proceeds as
       normal.

   4.  Remote Client joins in the Home Network.

7.2.  Configured Pre-Shared Key

   If a pre-shared key for IKE authentication is installed in both
   endpoints in advance, they need not exchange fingerprints of their
   certificates.  However they may still need to specify which pre-
   shared key they will use in the following IKE authentication in SDP
   because they may have several pre-shared keys.  Therefore, a new
   attribute "psk-fingerprint" is defined to exchange a fingerprint of
   pre-shared key over SDP.  It also has a role of making authorization
   in SIP consistent with authentication in IKE. "psk-fingerprint" is
   applied to pre-shared keys as "fingerprint" defined in RFC4572 is
   applied to certificates.  The following is the ABNF of the "psk-
   fingerprint" attribute.  The use of "psk-fingerprint" is OPTIONAL.

   attribute                 =/ psk-fingerprint-attribute

   psk-fingerprint-attribute = "psk-fingerprint" ":" hash-func SP
                               psk-fingerprint

   hash-func                 = "sha-1" / "sha-224" / "sha-256" /
                               "sha-384" / "sha-512" /
                               "md5" / "md2" / token
                               ; Additional hash functions can only come
                               ; from updates to RFC 3279

   psk-fingerprint           = 2UHEX *(":" 2UHEX)
                               ; Each byte in upper-case hex, separated
                               ; by colons.

   UHEX                      = DIGIT / %x41-46 ; A-F uppercase

   An example of SDP negotiation for IKE with pre-shared key
   authentication without IPsec NAT-Traversal is as follows.

8.  Security Considerations

   This entire document concerns itself with security, but the security
   considerations applicable to SDP in general is described in SDP
   specification.  And the security issues which should be considered in
   using comedia-tls are described in Section 7 in its specification.
   This section describes the security considerations specific in the
   negotiation of IKE using comedia-tls.

   Offering IKE in SDP (or agreeing to one in SDP offer/answer mode)
   does not create an obligation for an endpoint to accept any IKE
   session with the given fingerprint.  On the other hand, the endpoint
   must engage in the standard IKE negotiation procedure to ensure that
   the IPsec security associations (including encryption and
   authentication algorithms) chosen meet the security requirements of
   the higher-level application.  When IKE has finished negotiating, the
   decision to conclude IKE and establish an IPsec security association
   with the remote peer is entirely the decision of each endpoint.  This
   procedure is similar to how VPNs are typically established in the
   absence of SIP.

   In the general authentication process in IKE, subject DN or
   subjectAltName is recognized as the identity of the remote party.
   However by using SIP identity and SIP connected identity mechanisms
   in this spec, certificates are used just as a carrier for the public
   keys of the peers and there is no need for the information about who
   is the signer of the certificate and whom subject DN indicates.

   In this document, the purpose of using IKE is launching the IPsec SA,
   and it is not for the security mechanism of RTP and RTCP packets.
   Actually, this mechanism cannot provide end-to-end security inside
   the virtual private network as long as using tunnel mode IPsec,
   therefore other security methods such as SRTP must be used to secure
   them.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a session and media level SDP attribute, "udp-
   setup".  This attribute should be registered by the IANA under
   "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "att-field
   (both session and media level)".

   This document defines media formats "ike-esp" and "ike-esp-udpencap".
   These media format values should be registered by the IANA.  Media
   formats "ike-esp" and "ike-esp-udpencap" are associated with a proto
   value "UDP".

   This document defines a session and media level SDP attribute, "psk-
   fingerprint".  This attribute should be registered by the IANA under
   "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "att-field
   (both session and media level)".
