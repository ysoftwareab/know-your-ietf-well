1. Introduction

   The general structure of TRILL OAM messages is presented in
   [RFC7174]. TRILL OAM messages consist of five parts: link header,
   TRILL header, flow entropy, OAM message channel, and link
   trailer.

   The OAM message channel carries various control information and
   OAM related data between TRILL switches, also known as RBridges
   or Routing Bridges.

   A common OAM message channel representation can be shared between
   different technologies. This consistency between different OAM
   technologies promotes nested fault monitoring and isolation
   between technologies that share the same OAM framework.

   The TRILL OAM message channel is formatted as specified in IEEE
   Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) [8021Q].

   The ITU-T Y.1731 [Y1731] standard utilizes the same messaging
   format as [8021Q] OAM messages where applicable. This document
   takes a similar stance and reuses [8021Q] in TRILL OAM. It is
   assumed readers are familiar with [8021Q] and [Y1731]. Readers
   who are not familiar with these documents are encouraged to
   review them.

   This document updates [RFC6325] as specified in Section 3.1.

3. General Format of TRILL OAM Packets

   The TRILL forwarding paradigm allows an implementation to select
   a path from a set of equal cost paths to forward a unicast TRILL
   Data packet. For multi-destination TRILL Data packets, a
   distribution tree is chosen by the TRILL switch that ingresses or
   creates the packet. Selection of the path of choice is
   implementation dependent at each hop for unicast and at the
   ingress for multi-destination. However, it is a common practice
   to utilize Layer 2 through Layer 4 information in the frame
   payload for path selection.

   For accurate monitoring and/or diagnostics, OAM Messages are
   required to follow the same path as corresponding data packets.
   [RFC7174] presents the high-level format of the OAM messages. The
   details of the TRILL OAM frame format are defined in this
   document.

   Link Header: Media-dependent header. For Ethernet, this includes
   Destination MAC, Source MAC, VLAN (optional) and Ethertype
   fields.

   TRILL Header: Fixed size of 6 bytes when the Extended Header is
   not included [RFC6325]

   Flow Entropy: This is a 96-byte fixed size field. The rightmost
   bits of the field MUST be padded with zeros, up to 96 bytes, when
   the flow entropy is less than 96 bytes. Flow entropy enables
   emulation of the forwarding behavior of the desired data packets.
   The Flow Entropy field starts with the Inner.MacDA. The offset of
   the Inner.MacDA depends on whether extensions are included or not
   as specified in [RFC7179] and [RFC6325]. Such extensions are not
   commonly supported in current TRILL implementations.

   OAM Ethertype: OAM Ethertype is 16-bit Ethertype that identifies
   the OAM Message channel that follows. This document specifies
   using the Ethertype 0x8902 allocated for CFM [8021Q]. OAM Message
   Channel: This is a variable size section that carries OAM related
   information. The message format is as specified in [8021Q].

   Link Trailer: Media-dependent trailer. For Ethernet, this is the
   FCS (Frame Check Sequence).

3.1. Identification of TRILL OAM frames

   TRILL, as originally specified in [RFC6325], did not have a
   specific flag or a method to identify OAM frames. This document
   updates [RFC6325] to include specific methods to identify TRILL
   OAM frames. Section 3.2. below explains the details of the
   method.


3.2. Use of TRILL OAM Alert Flag

   The TRILL Header, as defined in [RFC6325], has two reserved bits.
   This document specifies use of the reserved bit next to Version
   field in the TRILL header as the Alert flag. Alert flag will be
   denoted by "A". RBridges MUST NOT use the "A" flag for forwarding
   decisions such as the selection of which ECMP path or multi-
   destination tree to select.


   Implementations that comply with this document MUST utilize "A"
   flag and CFM Ethertype to identify TRILL OAM frames.

                Figure 2 TRILL Header with the "A" Flag

   A (1 bit) - Indicates this is a possible OAM frame and is subject
   to specific handling as specified in this document.

   All other TRILL Header fields carry the same meaning as defined
   in RFC6325.

3.2.1. Handling of TRILL frames with the "A" Flag

   Value "1" in the A flag indicates TRILL frames that may qualify
   as OAM frames. Implementations are further REQUIRED to validate
   such frames by comparing the value at the OAM Ethertype (Figure
   1) location with the CFM Ethertype "0x8902" [8021Q]. If the value
   matches, such frames are identified as TRILL OAM frames and
   SHOULD be processed as discussed in Section 4.

   Frames with the "A" flag set that do not contain CFM Ethertype
   are not considered as OAM frames. Such frames MUST be silently
   discarded.

   OAM capable RBridges MUST NOT generate OAM frames to an RBridge
   that is not OAM capable.

   Intermediate RBridges, that are not OAM capable (i.e. do not
   understand the "A" flag) follow the process defined in [RFC6325]
   section 3.3 and forward OAM frames with "A" flag unaltered.

3.3. OAM Capability Announcement

   Any given RBridge can be (1) OAM incapable or (2) OAM capable
   with new extensions or (3) OAM capable with backwards-compatible
   method. The OAM request originator, prior to origination of the
   request is required to identify the OAM capability of the target
   and generate the appropriate OAM message.

   Capability flags defined in TRILL version sub-TLV (TRILL-VER)
   [RFC7176] will be utilized for announcing OAM capabilities. The
   following OAM related capability flags are defined:

   O - OAM Capable

   B - Backwards Compatible OAM

   A capability announcement, with "O" Flag set to 1 and "B" flag
   set to 1, indicates that the originating RBridge is OAM capable
   but utilizes the backwards compatible method defined in Appendix
   A. A capability announcement with "O" Flag set to 1 and "B" flag
   set to 0, indicates that the originating RBridge is OAM capable
   and utilizes the method specified in section 3.2.

   When "O" Flag is set to 0, the announcing implementation is
   considered not capable of OAM and the "B" flag is ignored.

        Figure 3 TRILL-VER sub-TLV [RFC7176] with O and B flags


   Capability flags "A" and "F" are defined by [RFC7176] and
   [RFC7172]. "O" and "B" Flags are located after "F" flag in the
   Capability and Header Flags field of TRILL-VER sub-TLV, as
   depicted in Figure 3 above. Usage of "O" and "B" flags are as
   discussed above.

   Absence of TRILL-VER sub-TLV means the announcing RBridge is not
   OAM capable.

3.4. Identification of the OAM message

   The ingress RBridge nickname allows recipients to identify the
   origin of the message in most cases. However, when an out of band
   reply is generated, the responding RBridge nickname is not easy
   to identify.

   The [8021Q] Sender ID TLV (1) provides methods to identify the
   device by including the chassis ID. Chassis ID allows different
   addressing formats such as IANA Address Family enumerations. IANA
   has allocated Address Family Number 16396 for TRILL RBridge
   nickname. In TRILL OAM the Chassis ID subtype of Sender ID TLV is
   set to 16396 and Chassis ID field contains the corresponding
   TRILL RBridge nickname.

   When the Sender ID TLV is present and chassis sub type is set to
   16396, the sender RBridge nickname SHOULD be derived from the
   nickname embedded in the Chassis ID. Otherwise, sender RBridge
   nickname SHOULD be derived from the ingress RBridge nickname.

   [RFC6325] Section 4.6 as updated by [RFC7180] provides a detailed
   explanation of frame processing. Please refer to those documents
   for additional details and for processing scenarios not covered
   herein.

   Sections 4.1 and 4.2 below apply to links using a broadcast LAN
   technology such as Ethernet.

   On links using an inherently point-to-point technology, such as
   PPP [RFC6361], there is no Outer.MacDA, Outer.MacSA, or
   Outer.VLAN because these are part of the link header for

   Ethernet. Point-to-point links typically have link headers
   without these fields.

4.1. Processing at ISS Layer

4.1.1. Receive Processing

   The ISS Layer receives an indication from the port. It extracts
   DA, SA and marks the remainder of the payload as M1. ISS Layer
   passes on (DA, SA, M1) as an indication to the higher layer.

   For TRILL Ethernet frames, this is Outer.MacDA and Outer.MacSA.
   M1 is the remainder of the packet.

4.1.2. Transmit Processing

   The ISS layer receives an indication from the higher layer that
   contains (DA, SA, M1). It constructs an Ethernet frame and passes
   down to the port.

4.2. End Station VLAN and Priority Processing

4.2.1. Receive Processing

   Receives (DA, SA, M1) indication from ISS Layer. Extracts the
   VLAN ID and priority from the M1 part of the received indication
   (or derive them from the port defaults or other default
   parameters) and constructs (DA, SA, VLAN, PRI, M2). VLAN+PRI+M2
   map to M1 in the received indication. Pass (DA, SA, VLAN, PRI,
   M2) to the TRILL encap/decap procession layer.

4.2.2. Transmit Procession

   Receive (DA, SA, VLAN, PRI, M2) indication from TRILL encap/decap
   processing layer. Merge VLAN, PRI, M2 to form M1. Pass down (DA,
   SA, M1) to the ISS processing Layer.

4.3. TRILL Encapsulation and De-capsulation Layer

4.3.1. Receive Processing for Unicast packets

   Receive indication (DA, SA, VLAN, PRI, M2) from End Station VLAN
   and Priority Processing Layer.

          Function.

4.3.2. Transmit Processing for unicast packets

     o  Receive indication (TRILL-HDR, iDA, iSA, iVL, M3) from
        RBridge Layer

     o  If egress TRILL nickname is local

          o If port is Appointed Forwarder for iVL and the port is
             not configured as a trunk or p2p port and (TRILL Alert
             Flag set and OAM Ethertype present) then

               . Strip TRILL-HDR and construct (DA, SA, VLAN, M2)
                  <- This is the TRILL Egress Function.

          o If TRILL Alert Flag is set and OAM Ethertype is present
             at the end of Flow entropy

               . Perform OAM Processing

          o Else extract the TRILL header, inner MAC addresses and

     o  If the DA is in the initial bridging/link protocols block
        (01-80-C2-00-00-00 to 01-80-C2-00-00-0F) or is in the TRILL
        block and not assigned for Outer.MacDA use (01-80-C2-00-00-
        42 to 01-80-C2-00-00-4F) then

          o The frame is not propagated through an RBridge although
             some special processing may be done at the port as
             specified in [RFC6325] and the frame may be dispatched
             to Layer 2 processing at the port if certain protocols
             are supported by that port (examples: Link Aggregation
             Protocol, Link Layer Discovery Protocol).

     o  If the DA is some other multicast value

     o  Receive indication (TRILL-HDR, iDA, iSA, iVL, M3) from
        RBridge layer.

     o  If TRILL-HDR multicast flag set and TRILL-HDR Alert flag

             Ethertype. M2 here is (Ethertype TRILL, TRILL-HDR, iDA,
             iSA, iVL, M)

     o  Pass the indication (DA, SA, V, M2) to End Station VLAN
        processing layer.

4.4. TRILL OAM Layer Processing

   TRILL OAM Processing Layer is located between the TRILL
   Encapsulation / De-capsulation layer and RBridge Layer. It
   performs the following:  1. Identification of OAM frames that
   need local processing and 2. performs OAM processing or redirect
   to the CPU for OAM processing.

     o  Receive indication (TRILL-HDR, iDA, iSA, iVL, M3) from
        RBridge layer. M3 is the payload after inner VLAN iVL.

     o  If the TRILL Multicast Flag is set and TRILL Alert Flag is
        set and TRILL OAM Ethertype is present then
          o If MEP or MIP is configured on the Inner.VLAN/FGL of the
             packet then
               . discard packets that have MD-LEVEL Less than that
                  of the MEP or packets that do not have MD-LEVEL
                  present (e.g., due to packet truncation).
               . If MD-LEVEL matches MD-LEVEL of the MEP then
                    .  Re-direct to OAM Processing (Do not forward
                       further)
               . If MD-LEVEL matches MD-LEVEL of MIP then
                    .  Make a Copy for OAM processing and continue
               . If MD-LEVL matches MD-LEVEL of MEP then
                    .  Redirect the OAM packet to OAM processing
                       and do not forward along or forward as a
                       native packet.


     o  Else if TRILL Alert Flag is set and TRILL OAM Ethertype is
        present then
          o If MEP or MIP is configured on the Inner.VLAN/FGL of the
             packet then
               . discard packets that have MD-LEVEL not present or
                  MD-LEVEL is Less than that of the MEP.
               . If MD-LEVEL matches MD-LEVEL of the MEP then
                    .  Re-direct to OAM Processing (Do not forward
                       further)
               . If MD-LEVEL matches MD-LEVEL of MIP then
                    .  Make a Copy for OAM processing and continue

     o  Else // Non-OAM Packet
          o  Continue

     o  Pass the indication (DA, SA, V, M2) to End Station VLAN
        processing layer.

   NOTE: In the Receive path, processing above compares against Down
   MEP and MIP Half functions. In the transmit processing it
   compares against Up MEP and MIP Half functions.

   Appointed Forwarder is a function the TRILL Encap/De-Cap layer
   performs. The TRILL Encap/De-cap Layer is responsible for
   prevention of leaking of OAM packets as native frames.


5. Maintenance Associations (MA) in TRILL

   [8021Q] defines a maintenance association as a logical
   relationship between a group of nodes. Each Maintenance
   Association (MA) is identified with a unique MAID of 48 bytes
   [8021Q]. CCM and other related OAM functions operate within the
   scope of an MA. The definition of MA is technology independent.
   Similarly it is encoded within the OAM message, not in the
   technology dependent portion of the packet. Hence the MAID as
   defined in [8021Q] can be utilized for TRILL OAM, without
   modifications. This also allows us to utilize CCM and LBM
   messages defined in [8021Q], as is.

   In TRILL, an MA may contain two or more RBridges (MEPs). For
   unicast, it is likely that the MA contains exactly two MEPs that
   are the two end-points of the flow. For multicast, the MA may
   contain two or more MEPs.

   For TRILL, in addition to all of the standard [8021Q] CFM MIB
   definitions, each MEP's MIB contains one or more flow entropy
   definitions corresponding to the set of flows that the MEP
   monitors.

   [8021Q] CFM MIB is augmented to add the TRILL specific
   information. Figure 5, below depicts the augmentation of the CFM
   MIB to add the TRILL specific Flow Entropy.

   document [TRILLOAMMIB].


6. MEP Addressing

   In IEEE CFM [8021Q], OAM messages address the target MEP by
   utilizing a unique MAC address.  In TRILL a MEP is addressed by
   combination of the egress RBridge nickname and the Inner
   VLAN/FGL.

   Additionally, MEPs are represented by 2 octet MEP-ID that is
   independent of the underlying technology. In CFM [8021Q] the
   value of MEP-ID is restricted to 1 to 8191. However, on CFM
   [8021Q] packet, MEP-ID are encoded as a 2 octet field. In TRILL
   Base Mode operation presented in Appendix B MEP-IDs are mapped 1


Senevirathne            Expires April 24, 2015                [Page 18]

   to 1 with the RBridge nicknames. Hence, In TRILL, MEP-ID MUST be
   a number in the range from 1 to 65535.

   At the MEP, OAM packets go through a hierarchy of op-code de-
   multiplexers. The op-code de-multiplexers channel the incoming
   OAM packets to the appropriate message processor (e.g. LBM) The
   reader may refer to Figure 6 below for a visual depiction of
   these different de-multiplexers.

   1. Identify the packets that need OAM processing at the Local
     RBridge as specified in Section 4.

        a.  Identify the MEP that is associated with the
          Inner.VLAN/FGL.

   2. The MEP first validates the MD-LEVEL and then

        a.  Redirect to MD-LEVEL De-multiplexer

   3. MD-LEVEL de-multiplexer compares the MD-Level of the packet
     against the MD level of the local MEPs of a given MD-Level on
     the port (Note: there can be more than one MEP at the same MD-
     Level but belonging to different MAs)

        a.  If the packet MD-LEVEL is equal to the configured MD-
          LEVEL of the MEP, then pass to the Opcode de-multiplexer

        b.  If the packet MD-LEVEL is less than the configured MD-
          LEVEL of the MEP, discard the packet

        c.  If the packer MD-LEVEL is greater than the configured
          MD-LEVEL of the MEP, then pass on to the next higher MD-
          LEVEL de-multiplexer, if available. Otherwise, if no such
          higher MD-LEVEL de-multiplexer exists, then forward the
          packet as normal data.

   4. Opcode De-multiplexer compares the opcode in the packet with
     supported opcodes

        a.  If Op-code is CCM, LBM, LBR, PTM, PTR, MTVM, MTVR, then
          pass on to the correct Processor

        b.  If Op-code is Unknown, then discard.

        OAM Ethertype is present after the flow entropy of the
        packet

        M : Is the post processing merge, merges data and OAM
        messages that are passed through. Additionally, the Merge
        component ensures, as explained earlier, that OAM packets
        are not forwarded out as native frames.

        L : Denotes MD-Level processing. Packets with MD-Level less
        than the Level will be dropped. Packets with equal MD-Level
        are passed on to the opcode de-multiplexer. Others are
        passed on to the next level MD processors or eventually to
        the merge point (M).

        NOTE: LBM, LBR, MTVM, MTVR, PTM and PTR are not subject to
        MA de-multiplexers. These packets do not have an MA encoded
        in the packet. Adequate response can be generated to these
        packets, without loss of functionality, by any of the MEPs
        present on that interface or an entity within the RBridge.

6.1. Use of MIP in TRILL

   Maintenance Intermediate Points (MIP) are mainly used for fault
   isolation. Link Trace Messages in [8021Q] utilize a well-known
   multicast MAC address and MIPs generate responses to Link Trace
   messages. Response to Link Trace messages or lack thereof can be
   used for fault isolation in TRILL.

   As explained in section 10. , a hop-count expiry approach will be
   utilized for fault isolation and path tracing. The approach is
   very similar to the well-known IP trace-route approach. Hence,
   explicit addressing of MIPs is not required for the purpose of
   fault isolation.

   Any given RBridge can have multiple MIPs located within an
   interface. As such, a mechanism is required to identify which MIP
   should respond to an incoming OAM message. Any MIP residing
   within the ingress interface may reply to the incoming Path Trace
   message without loss of functionality or information. As
   specified in Section 3.4. , the address of the responding RBridge
   can be identified by means of Sender ID TLV (1).  The Reply
   Ingress TLV (5) identifies the interface id. The combination of
   these allows recipient of the response to uniquely identify the
   responder.

   A similar approach to that presented above for MEPs can be used
   for MIP processing. It is important to note that "M", the merge
   block of a MIP, does not prevent OAM packets leaking out as
   native frames. On edge interfaces, MEPs MUST be configured to
   prevent the leaking of TRILL OAM packets out of the TRILL Campus.

7. Continuity Check Message (CCM)

   CCMs are used to monitor connectivity and configuration errors.
   [8021Q] monitors connectivity by listening to periodic CCM
   messages received from its remote MEP partners in the MA. An
   [8021Q] MEP identifies cross-connect errors by comparing the MAID
   in the received CCM message with the MEP's local MAID. The MAID
   [8021Q] is a 48-byte field that is technology independent.
   Similarly, the MEPID is a 2-byte field that is independent of the
   technology. Given this generic definition of CCM fields, CCM as
   defined in [8021Q] can be utilized in TRILL with no changes.
   TRILL specific information may be carried in CCMs when encoded
   using TRILL specific TLVs or sub-TLVs. This is possible since
   CCMs may carry optional TLVs.

   Unlike classical Ethernet environments, TRILL contains multipath
   forwarding. The path taken by a packet depends on the payload of
   the packet. The Maintenance Association identifies the interested
   end-points (MEPs) of a given monitored path. For unicast there
   are only two MEPs per MA. For multicast there can be two or more
   MEPs in the MA. The entropy values of the monitored flows are
   defined within the MA. CCM transmit logic will utilize these flow
   entropy values when constructing the CCM packets. Please see
   section 12.  below for the theory of operation of CCM.

   The MIB of [8021Q] is augmented with the definition of flow-
   entropy. Please see [TRILLOAMMIB] for definition of these and
   other TRILL related OAM MIB definitions. The below Figure depicts
   the correlation between MA, CCM and the flow-entropy.

   In a multi-pathing environment, a Flow - by definition - is
   unidirectional. A question may arise as to what flow entropy
   should be used in the response. CCMs are unidirectional and have
   no explicit reply; as such, the issue of the response flow
   entropy does not arise. In the transmitted CCM, each MEP reports
   local status using the Remote Defect Indication (RDI) flag.
   Additionally, a MEP may raise SNMP TRAPs [TRILLOAMMIB] as Alarms
   when a connectivity failure occurs.

8. TRILL OAM Message Channel

   The TRILL OAM Message Channel can be divided into two parts:
   TRILL OAM Message header and TRILL OAM Message TLVs. Every OAM
   Message MUST contain a single TRILL OAM message header and a set
   of one or more specified OAM Message TLVs.

8.1. TRILL OAM Message header

   As discussed earlier, a common messaging framework between
   [8021Q], TRILL, and other similar standards such as Y.1731 is
   accomplished by re-using the OAM message header defined in
   [8021Q].

     o  MD-L: Maintenance Domain Level (3 bits). Identifies the
        maintenance domain level. For TRILL, in general, this field
        is set to a single value across the TRILL campus. When using
        TRILL base mode as specified in Appendix B, MD-L is set to
        3. However, extension of TRILL, for example to support
        multilevel, may create different MD-LEVELs and MD-L field
        must be appropriately set in those scenarios. (Please refer
        to [8021Q] for the definition of MD-Level)

     o  Version: Indicates the version (5 bits) as specified in
        [8021Q]. This document does not require changing the Version
        defined in [8021Q].

     o  OpCode: Operation Code (8 bits). Specifies the operation
        performed by the message. See Section 8.2.

     o  Flags: Includes operational flags (1 byte). The definition
        of flags is Opcode-specific and is covered in the applicable
        sections.

     o  FirstTLVOffset: Defines the location of the first TLV, in
        bytes, starting from the end of the FirstTLVOffset field (1
        byte). (Refer to [8021Q] for the definition of the
        FirstTLVOffset.)

   MD-L, Version, Opcode, Flags and FirstTLVOffset fields
   collectively are referred to as the OAM Message Header.

   The Opcode specific information section of the OAM Message may
   contain Session Identification number, time-stamp, etc.

8.2. TRILL Specific OAM Opcodes

   The following TRILL specific CFM Opcodes are defined. Each of the
   Opcodes indicates a separate type of TRILL OAM message. Details
   of the messages are presented in the related sections.

   TRILL OAM Message Opcodes:

    TBD1: Path Trace Reply
    TBD2: Path Trace Message
    TBD3: Multicast Tree Verification Reply
    TBD4: Multicast Tree Verification Message

    Loopback and CCM Messages reuse the opcodes defined by [8021Q]

8.3. Format of TRILL OAM TLV

   The same CFM TLV format as defined in [8021Q] is used for TRILL
   OAM. The following figure depicts the general format of a TRILL
   OAM TLV:

   Type (1 octet): Specifies the Type of the TLV (see sections 8.4.
   for TLV types).

   Length (2 octets): Specifies the length of the 'Value' field in
   octets. Length of the 'Value' field can be either zero or more
   octets.

   Value (variable): The length and the content of this field depend
   on the type of the TLV. Please refer to applicable TLV

   Semantics and usage of Type values allocated for TRILL OAM
   purpose are defined by this document and other future related
   documents.

8.4. TRILL OAM TLVs

   TRILL related TLVs are defined in this section. [8021Q] defined
   TLVs are reused, where applicable.

8.4.1. Common TLVs between CFM and TRILL

   Type (1 octet) = TBDa indicate that this is the TRILL OAM
   Application Identifier TLV.

   Length (2 octets) = 9.

   TRILL OAM Version (1 octet), currently set to zero. Indicates the
   TRILL OAM version. TRILL OAM version can be different than the
   [8021Q] version.

   Reserved1 (3 octets): set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

   Fragment-ID (1 octet): Indicates the fragment number of the
   current message. This applies only to reply messages; in request
   messages it must be set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   receipt. F flag defined below MUST be set with the final message
   whether it is the last fragment of the fragmented message or only
   message of the reply. Section 13.  below provides more details on
   OAM Message fragmentation.

   Return Code (1 octet): Set to zero on requests. Set to an
   appropriate value in response messages.

   Return sub-code (1 Octet): Return sub-code is set to zero on
   transmission of request message. Return sub-code identifies
   categories within a specific Return code. Return sub-code MUST be
   interpreted within a Return code.

   Reserved2 (12 bits): Set to zero on transmission and ignored on
   reception.

   F (1 bit): Final flag, when set, indicates this is the last
   response.

   C (1 bit): Cross connect error flag(VLAN/Label mapping error), if
   set indicates that the label (VLAN/FGL) in the flow entropy is
   different than the label included in the diagnostic TLV.  This
   field is ignored in request messages and MUST only be interpreted
   in response messages.

   O (1 bit): If set, indicates, OAM out-of-band response requested.

   I (1 bit): If set, indicates, OAM in-band response requested.

   NOTE: When both O and I bits are set to zero, indicates that no
   response is required (silent mode). User MAY specify both O and I

   Type (1 octet) = TBDb

   Length (2 octets) = Variable. Minimum length is 2 + the length
   (in octets) of the shortest address. Currently the minimum value
   of this field is 4, but this could change in the future if a new
   address shorter than the TRILL RBridge nickname is defined.

   Address Type (1 octet) = 0 - IPv4. 1 - IPv6. 2 - TRILL RBridge
   nickname. All other values reserved.

   Addr Length (1 octet) = Depends on the Address Type. Currently
   defined values are: 4 - IPv4. 16 - IPv6, 2 - TRILL RBridge
   nickname. Other lengths may be acceptable for future Address
   Types.

   Reply Address (variable): Address where the reply needed to be
   sent. Length depends on the address specification.

8.4.5. Diagnostics Label TLV

   Diagnostic label specifies the data label (VLAN or FGL) in which
   the OAM messages are generated. Receiving RBridge MUST compare
   the data label of the Flow entropy to the data label specified in
   the Diagnostic Label TLV. Label Error Flag in the response (TRILL
   OAM Message Version TLV) MUST be set when the two VLANs do not
   match.

   RBridges do not perform Label error checking when the Label TLV
   is not included in the OAM message. In certain deployments
   intermediate devices may perform label translation. In such
   scenarios, originator should not include the diagnostic Label TLV
   in OAM messages. Inclusion of diagnostic TLV will generate
   unwanted label error notifications.

8.4.7. RBridge scope TLV

   RBridge scope TLV identifies nicknames of RBridges from which a
   response is required. The RBridge scope TLV is only applicable to
   Multicast Tree Verification messages. This TLV SHOULD NOT be
   included in other messages. Receiving RBridges MUST ignore this
   TLV on messages other than Multicast Verification Message.

   Each TLV can contain up to 255 nicknames of in-scope RBridges. A
   Multicast Verification Message may contain multiple "RBridge
   scope TLVs", in the event that more than 255 in scope RBridges
   need to be specified.

   Absence of the "RBridge scope TLV" indicates that a response is
   needed from all the RBridges. Please see section 11. for details.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


   With Auth Type 3, the process is generally as specified in
   [RFC5310] using the same Key ID space as TRILL [IS-IS]. The area
   covered by the Authentication TLV is from the beginning of the
   TRILL Header to the end of the TRILL OAM Message Channel - the
   Link Header and Trailer are not included. The TRILL Header Alert
   and Reserved bit and Hop Count are treated as if zero for the
   purposes of computing and verifying the Authentication Data.

   Key distribution is out of scope for this document as the keying
   distributed for IS-IS is used.

   An RBridge supporting OAM authentication can be configured to
   either (1) ignore received OAM Authentication TLVs and not send
   them, (2) ignore received OAM Authentication TLVs but include
   them in all OAM packets sent, or (3) to include Authentication
   TLVs in all OAM messages sent and enforce authentication of OAM
   messages received. When an RBridge is enforcing authentication,
   it discards any OAM message subject to OAM processing that does
   not contain an Authentication TLV or if the Authentication TLV
   does not verify.

                 Figure 21 Loopback OAM Message Format

   The above figure depicts the format of the Loopback Request and
   response messages as defined in [8021Q]. The Opcode for Loopback
   Message is set to 3 and the Opcode for the Reply Message is set
   to 2 [8021Q]. The Loopback Transaction Identifier (commonly
   called the Session Identification Number or Session ID in this
   document) is a 32-bit integer that allows the requesting RBridge
   to uniquely identify the corresponding session. Responding
   RBridges, without modification, MUST echo the received "Loopback
   Transaction Identifier" number.

9.2. Theory of Operation

9.2.1. Actions by Originator RBridge

   The originator RBridge takes the following actions:

   Identifies the destination RBridge nickname based on user
   specification or based on the specified destination MAC or IP
   address.

   Constructs the flow entropy based on user specified parameters or
   implementation specific default parameters.

   Constructs the TRILL OAM header: sets the opcode to Loopback
   message type (3)[8021Q]. Assigns applicable Loopback Transaction
   Identifier number for the request.

Internet-Draft          TRILL Fault Management             October 2014


   The TRILL OAM Application Identifier TLV MUST be included and
   with the flags set to applicable values.

   Include following OAM TLVs, where applicable

     o  Out of Band Reply Address TLV

     o  Diagnostic Label TLV

     o  Sender ID TLV

   Specify the Hop count of the TRILL data frame per user
   specification or utilize an applicable Hop count value.

   Dispatch the OAM frame for transmission.

   RBridges may continue to retransmit the request at periodic
   intervals, until a response is received or the re-transmission
   count expires. At each transmission Session Identification number
   MUST be incremented.

9.2.2. Intermediate RBridge

   Intermediate RBridges forward the frame as a normal data frame
   and no special handling is required.

9.2.3. Destination RBridge

   If the Loopback message is addressed to the local RBridge and
   satisfies the OAM identification criteria specified in section
   3.1. then, the RBridge data plane forwards the message to the CPU
   for further processing.

   The TRILL OAM application layer further validates the received
   OAM frame by checking for the presence of OAM-Ethertype at the
   end of the flow entropy. Frames that do not contain OAM-Ethertype
   at the end of the flow entropy MUST be discarded.

   Construction of the TRILL OAM response:

   TRILL OAM application encodes the received TRILL header and flow
   entropy in the Original payload TLV and includes it in the OAM
   message.

    Set the Return Code to (1) "Reply" and Return sub code to zero
   (0) "Valid Response".  Update the TRILL OAM opcode to 2 (Loopback
   Message Reply)

   Optionally, if the VLAN/FGL identifier value of the received flow
   entropy differs from the value specified in the diagnostic Label,
   set the Label Error Flag on TRILL OAM Application Identifier TLV.

   Include the sender ID TLV (1)

   If in-band response was requested, dispatch the frame to the
   TRILL data plane with request-originator RBridge nickname as the
   egress RBridge nickname.

   If out-of-band response was requested, dispatch the frame to the
   IP forwarding process.

10. Path Trace Message

   The primary use of the Path Trace Message is for fault isolation.
   It may also be used for plotting the path taken from a given
   RBridge to another RBridge.

   [8021Q] accomplishes the objectives of the TRILL Path Trace
   Message using Link Trace Messages. Link Trace Messages utilize a
   well-known multicast MAC address. This works for [8021Q], because
   for 802.1 both the unicast and multicast paths are congruent.
   However, in TRILL multicast and unicast are not congruent. Hence,
   TRILL OAM uses a new message format: the Path Trace message.

   The Path Trace Message has the same format as Loopback Message.
   The Opcode for Path Trace Reply is TBD1 and for Path Trace
   Message is TBD2.

   Operation of the Path Trace message is identical to the Loopback
   message except that it is first transmitted with a TRILL Header
   Hop count field value of 1. The sending RBridge expects an
   "Intermediate RBridge" Return sub-code from the next hop or a
   "Valid response" Return sub-Code response from the destination
   RBridge. If an "Intermediate RBridge"  Return sub-code is
   received in the response, the originator RBridge records the
   information received from intermediate node that generated the
   message and resends the message by incrementing the previous Hop
   count value by 1. This process is continued until, a response is
   received from the destination RBridge or Path Trace process
   timeout occur or Hop count reaches a configured maximum value.

10.1. Theory of Operation

10.1.1. Action by Originator RBridge

   Identify the destination RBridge based on user specification or
   based on location of the specified MAC address.

   Construct the flow entropy based on user specified parameters or
   implementation specific default parameters.

   Construct the TRILL OAM header: Set the opcode to Path Trace
   Request message type (TBD2). Assign an applicable Session
   Identification number for the request. Return-code and sub-code
   MUST be set to zero.

   The TRILL OAM Application Identifier TLV MUST be included and set
   the flags to applicable values.

   Include following OAM TLVs, where applicable

     o  Out of Band Reply Address TLV

     o  Diagnostic Label TLV

     o  Include the Sender ID TLV

   Specify the Hop count of the TRILL data frame as 1 for the first
   request.

   Dispatch the OAM frame to the TRILL data plane for transmission.

   An RBridge may continue to retransmit the request at periodic
   intervals, until a response is received or the re-transmission
   count expires. At each new re-transmission, the Session
   Identification number MUST be incremented. Additionally, for
   responses received from intermediate RBridges, the RBridge
   nickname and interface information MUST be recorded.



10.1.2. Intermediate RBridge

   Path Trace Messages transit through Intermediate RBridges
   transparently, unless Hop-count has expired.

   TRILL OAM application layer further validates the received OAM
   frame by examining the presence of TRILL Alert Flag and OAM-

   Ethertype at the end of the flow entropy and by examining the MD
   Level. Frames that do not contain OAM-Ethertype at the end of the
   flow entropy MUST be discarded.

   Construction of the TRILL OAM response:

   TRILL OAM application encodes the received TRILL header and flow
   entropy in the Original payload TLV and include it in the OAM
   message.

   Set the Return Code to (1) "Reply" and Return sub code to zero
   (2) "Intermediate RBridge". Update the TRILL OAM opcode to TBD1
   (Path Trace Reply).

   If the VLAN/FGL identifier value of the received flow entropy
   differs from the value specified in the diagnostic Label, set the
   Label Error Flag on TRILL OAM Application Identifier TLV.

10.1.3. Destination RBridge

   Processing is identical to section 10.1.2. With the exception
   that TRILL OAM Opcode is set to Path Trace Reply (TBD1).

11. Multi-Destination Tree Verification Message (MTVM)

   Multi-Destination Tree Verification messages allow verifying
   TRILL distribution tree integrity and pruning. TRILL VLAN/FGL and
   multicast pruning are described in [RFC6325] [RFC7180] and
   [RFC7172]. Multi-destination tree verification and Multicast
   group verification messages are designed to detect pruning
   defects. Additionally, these tools can be used for plotting a
   given multicast tree within the TRILL campus.

   Multi-Destination tree verification OAM frames are copied to the
   CPU of every intermediate RBridge that is part of the
   distribution tree being verified. The originator of the Multi-
   destination Tree verification message specifies the scope of
   RBridges from which a response is required. Only the RBridges
   listed in the scope field respond to the request. Other RBridges
   silently discard the request. Inclusion of the scope parameter is
   required to prevent receiving an excessive number of responses.
   The typical scenario of distribution tree verification or group
   verification, involves verifying multicast connectivity to a
   selected set of end-nodes as opposed to the entire network.
   Availability of the scope facilitates narrowing down the focus to
   only the RBridges of interest.

   Implementations MAY choose to rate-limit CPU bound multicast
   traffic. As a result of rate-limiting or due to other congestion
   conditions, MTVM messages may be discarded from time to time by
   the intermediate RBRidges and the requester may be required to
   retransmit the request. Implementations SHOULD narrow the
   embedded scope of retransmission request only to RBridges that
   have failed to respond.

11.1. Multi-Destination Tree Verification Message (MTVM) Format

   Format of MTVM  is identical to that of Loopback Message format
   defined in section 9. with the exception that the Op-Code used is
   TBD4.

11.2. Theory of Operation

11.2.1. Actions by Originator RBridge

   The user is required at a minimum to specify either the
   distribution trees that need to be verified, or the Multicast MAC
   address and VLAN/FGL, or VLAN/FGL and Multicast destination IP
   address. Alternatively, for more specific multicast flow
   verification, the user MAY specify more information e.g. source
   MAC address, VLAN/FGL, Destination and Source IP addresses.
   Implementations, at a minimum, must allow the user to specify a
   choice of distribution trees, Destination Multicast MAC address
   and VLAN/FGL that needs to be verified. Although, it is not
   mandatory, it is highly desired to provide an option to specify
   the scope. It should be noted that the source MAC address and
   some other parameters may not be specified if the Backwards
   Compatibility Method of Appendix A is used to identify the OAM
   frames.

   Default parameters MUST be used for unspecified parameters. Flow
   entropy is constructed based on user specified parameters and/or
   default parameters.

   Based on user specified parameters, the originating RBridge does
   the following:

      Identifies the nickname that represents the multicast tree.

      Obtains the applicable Hop count value for the selected
   multicast tree.

      Constructs TRILL OAM message header and include Session
   Identification number. Session Identification number facilitate
   the originator mapping the response to the correct request.

      Includes TRILL OAM Application Identifier TLV, which MUST be
   included.

      Includes the Op-Code Multicast Tree Verification Message
   (TBD4)

      Includes RBridge scope TLV (TBDe)

      Optionally, include following TLV, where applicable

          o Out-of-band IP address (TBDb)

      Specify the Hop count of the TRILL data frame per user
   specification or alternatively utilize the applicable Hop count
   value if TRILL Hop count is not being specified by the user; and

      Dispatch the OAM frame to the TRILL data plane to be ingressed
   for transmission.

   The RBridge may continue to retransmit the request at a periodic
   interval until either a response is received or the re-
   transmission count expires. At each new re-transmission, the
   Session Identification number MUST be incremented. At each re-
   transmission, the RBridge may further reduce the scope to the
   RBridges that it has not received a response from.

11.2.2. Receiving RBridge

   Receiving RBridges identify multicast verification frames per the
   procedure explained in sections 3.2.

   The RBridge validates the frame and analyzes the scope RBridge
   list. If the RBridge scope TLV is present and the local RBridge
   nickname is not specified in the scope list, it will silently
   discard the frame. If the local RBridge is specified in the scope
   list OR RBridge scope TLV is absent, the receiving RBridge
   proceeds with further processing as defined in section 11.2.3.

11.2.3.  In scope RBridges

   egress RBridge nickname.

   If out-of-band response was requested, dispatch the frame to the

12. Application of Continuity Check Message (CCM) in TRILL

   Section 7.  provides an overview of CCM Messages defined in
   [8021Q] and how they can be used within the TRILL OAM. This
   section, presents the application and Theory of Operations of CCM
   within the TRILL OAM framework. Readers are referred to [8021Q]
   for CCM message format and applicable TLV definitions and usages.
   Only the TRILL specific aspects are explained below.

   In TRILL, between any two given MEPs there can be multiple
   potential paths. Whereas in [8021Q], there is always a single
   path between any two MEPs at any given time. [RFC6905] requires
   solutions to have the ability to monitor continuity over one or
   more paths.

   CCM Messages are uni-directional, such that there is no explicit
   response to a received CCM message. Connectivity status is
   indicated by setting the applicable flags (e.g. RDI) of the CCM
   messages transmitted by an MEP.

   It is important that the solution presented in this document
   accomplishes the requirements specified in [RFC6905] within the
   framework of [8021Q] in a straightforward manner and with minimum
   changes. Section 8 above defines multiple flows within the CCM
   object, each corresponding to a flow that a given MEP wishes to
   monitor. Hence, CCM, in multipath environments like TRILL,
   monitors per flow connectivity and cross connect errors.

Internet-Draft          TRILL Fault Management             October 2014


   Receiving MEPs do not cross check whether a received CCM belongs
   to a specific flow from the originating RBridge. Any attempt to
   track status of individual flows may explode the amount of state
   information that any given RBridge has to maintain.

   The obvious question arises: How does the originating RBridge
   know which flow or flows are at fault?

   This is accomplished with a combination of the RDI flag in the
   CCM header, flow-id TLV, and SNMP Notifications (Traps). Section
   12.1.  below discuss the procedure.

12.1. CCM Error Notification

   Each MEP transmits 4 CCM messages per each flow. ([8021Q] detects
   CCM fault when 3 consecutive CCM messages are lost). Each CCM
   Message has a unique sequence number (Session ID) and unique
   flow-identifier. The flow identifier is included in the OAM
   message via flow-id TLV.

   When an MEP notices a CCM timeout from a remote MEP (MEP-A), it
   sets the RDI flag on the next CCM message it generates.
   Additionally, it logs and sends SNMP notification that contain
   the remote MEP Identification, flow-id and the Sequence Number of
   the last CCM message it received and if available, the flow-id
   and the Sequence Number of the first CCM message it received
   after the failure. Each MEP maintains a unique flow-id per each
   flow, hence the operator can easily identify flows that
   correspond to the specific flow-id.

   The following example illustrates the above.

   Assume there are two MEPs, MEP-A and MEP-B.

   Assume there are 3 flows between MEP-A and MEP-B.

   Let's assume MEP-A allocates sequence numbers as follows

   Flow-1 Sequence={1,2,3,4,13,14,15,16,.. } flow-id=(1)

   Flow-2 Sequence={5,6,7,8,17,18,19,20,.. } flow-id=(2)

   Flow-3 Sequence={9,10,12,11,21,22,23,24,.. } flow-id=(3)

   Let's Assume Flow-2 is at fault.




Senevirathne            Expires April 24, 2015                [Page 48]

Internet-Draft          TRILL Fault Management             October 2014


   MEP-B, receives CCM from MEP-A with sequence numbers 1,2,3,4, but
   did not receive 5,6,7,8. CCM timeout is set to 3 CCM intervals in
   [8021Q]. Hence MEP-B detects the error at the 8'th CCM message.
   At this time the sequence number of the last good CCM message
   MEP-B has received from MEP-A is 4 and flow-id of the last good
   CCM Message is (1). Hence MEP-B will generate a CCM error SNMP
   notification with MEP-A and Last good flow-id (1) and sequence
   number 4.

   When MEP-A switches to flow-3 after transmitting flow-2, MEP-B
   will start receiving CCM messages. In the foregoing example it
   will be CCM message with Sequence Numbers 9,10,11,12,21 and so
   on. When in receipt of a new CCM message from a specific MEP,
   after a CCM timeout, the TRILL OAM will generate an SNMP
   Notification of CCM resume with remote MEP-ID and the first valid
   flow-id and the Sequence number after the CCM timeout. In the
   foregoing example, it is MEP-A, flow-id (3) and Sequence Number
   9.

   The remote MEP list under the CCM MIB Object is augmented to
   contain "Last Sequence Number", flow-id and "CCM Timeout"
   variables. Last Sequence Number and flow-id are updated every
   time a CCM is received from a remote MEP. CCM Timeout variable is
   set when the CCM timeout occurs and is cleared when a CCM is
   received.

12.2. Theory of Operation

12.2.1. Actions by Originator RBridge

   Derive the flow entropy based on flow entropy specified in the
   CCM Management object.

   Construct the TRILL CCM OAM header as specified in [8021Q].

   TRILL OAM Version TLV MUST be included as the first TLV and set
   the flags to applicable values.

   Include other TLVs specified in [8021Q]

   Include the following optional TLV, where applicable

     o  Sender ID TLV (1)

Internet-Draft          TRILL Fault Management             October 2014


   Specify the Hop count of the TRILL data frame per user
   specification or utilize an applicable Hop count value.

   Dispatch the OAM frame to the TRILL data plane for transmission.

   An RBridge transmits a total of 4 requests, each at CCM
   retransmission interval. At each transmission the Session
   Identification number MUST be incremented by one.

   At the 5'th retransmission interval, flow entropy of the CCM
   packet is updated to the next flow entropy specified in the CCM
   Management Object. If current flow entropy is the last flow
   entropy specified, move to the first flow entropy specified and
   continue the process.

12.2.2. Intermediate RBridge

   Intermediate RBridges forward the frame as a normal data frame
   and no special handling is required.

12.2.3. Destination RBridge

   If the CCM Message is addressed to the local RBridge or multicast
   and satisfies OAM identification methods specified in sections
   3.2. then the RBridge data plane forwards the message to the CPU
   for further processing.

   The TRILL OAM application layer further validates the received
   OAM frame by examining the presence of OAM-Ethertype at the end
   of the flow entropy. Frames that do not contain OAM-Ethertype at
   the end of the flow entropy MUST be discarded.

   Validate the MD-LEVEL and pass the packet to the Opcode de-
   multiplexer. The Opcode de-multiplexer delivers CCM packets to
   the CCM process.

   The CCM Process performs processing specified in [8021Q].

   Additionally the CCM process updates the CCM Management Object
   with the sequence number of the received CCM packet. Note: The
   last received CCM sequence number and CCM timeout are tracked per
   each remote MEP.

   If the CCM timeout is true for the sending remote MEP, then clear
   the CCM timeout in the CCM Management object and generate the
   SNMP notification as specified above.

13. Fragmented Reply

   TRILL OAM allows Fragmented reply messages. In case of Fragmented
   Replies, all part of the reply MUST follow the procedure defined
   in this section.

   The same session Identification Number MUST be included in all
   related fragments of the same message.

   The TRILL OAM Application Identifier TLV MUST be included, with
   fragment-ID field monotonically increasing with each fragment
   transmitted with the appropriate Final Flag field. The Final
   Flag, MUST, only be equal to one on the final fragment of the
   reply.

   On the receiver, process MUST order the fragments based on the
   fragment id. Any fragments received after final fragment MUST be
   discarded. Messages with incomplete fragments (i.e. messages with
   one or missing fragments after the receipt of the fragment with
   the final flag set) MUST be discarded as well.

   If number of fragments exceed the maximum supported fragments
   (255), then return code of MUST be set according to the message
   and return sub code MUST be set to 1 indicating fragment limit
   exceed.

14. Security Considerations

   Forged OAM packets could cause false error or failure indications
   or mask actual errors or failures or be used for denial of
   service. Source addresses for messages can be forged and the Out
   of Band reply facility (Section 8.4.4) provides for explicitly
   supplying the address for replies. For protection against forged
   OAM packets, the Authentication TLV (see Section 8.4.13) can be
   used in an OAM message in TRILL. This TLV depends on IS-IS keying
   material and the current state of IS-IS keying and the use of the
   virtually identical IS-IS Authentication TLV is analyzed in
   [KARPISIS]. In particular, there is currently no standardized IS-
   IS automated key management.


   Of course, authentication is ineffective unless verified and
   ineffective against senders who have the keying material needed
   to produce OAM messages that will pass authentication checks.
   Implementations MUST implement rate-limiting functionality to

Internet-Draft          TRILL Fault Management             October 2014


   protect against exploitation of OAM messages as a means of denial
   of service attacks. Aggressive rate limiting may trigger false
   positive errors against CCM and LBM based session monitoring.


   Even with authentication, replay of authenticated messages may be
   possible. There are four types of messages: Continuity Check
   (CCM), Loopback, Path Trace, and Multi-Destination Tree
   Verification (MTVM). In the case of CCM messages, sequence
   numbers are required (see Section 12.1) that can protect against
   replay. In the case of Loopback Messages (see Section 9.1), a
   Loopback Transaction Identifier is included that, as required by
   [8021Q], is incremented with each transmission and can detect
   replays. Path Trace Messages (see Section 10) and MTVM (see
   section 11.1) are specified to have the same format, although
   with a different OpCodes, as the Loopback Message and so also
   have an identifier increment with each transmission that can
   detect replays. Thus all TRILL OAM messages have a field that can
   be used for replay protection.


   For general TRILL related security considerations, please refer
   to [RFC6325].

   [8021Q] requires that the MEP filters or pass through OAM
   messages based on the MD-Level. The MD-Level is embedded deep in
   the OAM message. Hence, conventional methods of frame filtering
   may not be able to filter frames based on the MD-Level. As a
   result, OAM messages that must be dropped due to MD level
   mismatch may leak into a TRILL domain with different MD-Level.

   This leaking may not cause any functionality loss. The receiving
   MEP/MIP is required to validate the MD-level prior to acting on
   the message. Any frames received with an incorrect MD-Level need
   to be dropped.

   Generally, a single operator manages each TRILL campus, hence
   there is no risk of security exposure. However, in the event of
   multi operator deployments, operators should be aware of possible
   exposure of device specific information and appropriate measures
   must be taken.

   It is also important to note that the MPLS OAM [RFC4379]
   framework does not include the concept of domains and OAM
   filtering based on operators. It is our opinion that the lack of
   OAM frame filtering based on domains does not introduce
   significant functional deficiency or security risk.

   It is possible to mandate requiring different credentials to use
   different OAM functions or capabilities within a specific OAM
   function. Implementations may consider grouping users to
   different security clearance levels and restricting functions and
   capabilities to different clearance levels. However, Exact
   implementation details of such a framework are outside the scope
   of this document.

Appendix A.                  Backwards Compatibility

   Methodology presented above in this document is in-line with the
   [8021Q] framework for providing fault management coverage.
   However, in practice, some TRILL platforms may not have the
   capabilities to support some of the required techniques. In this
   section, we present a method that allows RBridges, which do not
   have the required hardware capabilities, to participate in the
   TRILL OAM solution.

   There are two broad areas to be considered; 1. Maintenance Point
   (MEP/MIP) Model 2. Data plane encoding and frame identification

   A.1 Maintenance Point (MEP/MIP) Model

   For backwards compatibility, MEPs and MIPs are located in the
   CPU. This will be referred to as the "central brain" model as
   opposed to "port brain" model.

   In the "central brain" model, an RBridge using either ACLs or
   some other method, forwards qualifying OAM messages to the CPU.
   The CPU then performs the required processing and multiplexing to
   the correct MP (Maintenance Point).

   Additionally, RBridges MUST have the capability to prevent the
   leaking of OAM packets, as specified in [RFC6905].

   A.2 Data plane encoding and frame identification

   The backwards compatibility method presented in this section
   defines methods to identify OAM frames when implementations do
   not have capabilities to utilize TRILL OAM Alert flag presented
   earlier to identify OAM frames, in the hardware.

   It is assumed ECMP path selection of non-IP flows utilize MAC DA,
   MAC SA and VLAN, IP Flows utilize IP DA, IP SA and TCP/UDP port
   numbers and other Layer 3 and Layer 4 information. The well-known
   fields to identify OAM flows are chosen such that they mimic the
   ECMP selection of the actual data along the path. However, it is
   important to note that, there may be implementations that would
   utilize these well-known fields for ECMP selections. Hence,
   implementations that support OAM SHOULD move to utilizing TRILL
   Alert Flag, as soon as possible and methods presented here SHOULD
   be used only as an interim solution.

Internet-Draft          TRILL Fault Management             October 2014


   Identification methods are divided in to 4 broader groups:

   1. Identification of Unicast non-IP OAM Flows,

   2. Identification of Multicast non-IP OAM Flows,

   3. Identification of Unicast IP OAM Flows and

   4. Identification of Multicast IP OAM Flows



   As presented in the table below, based on the flow type (as
   defined above), implementations are required to use a well-known
   value in either the Inner.MacSA field or OAM Ethertype field to
   identify OAM flows.

   Receiving RBridge identifies OAM flows based on the presence of
   the well-known values in the specified fields, and additionally,
   for unicast flows, egress RBridge nickname of the packet MUST
   match that of the local RBridge or for multicast flows, TRILL
   header mutlicast flag MUST be set.

   Unicast OAM flows that qualify for local processing MUST be
   redirected to the OAM process and MUST NOT be forwarded (that to
   prevent leaking of the packet out of the TRILL campus).

   A copy of Multicast OAM flows that qualify for local processing
   MUST be sent to the OAM process and packet MUST be forwarded
   along the normal path. Additionally, methods MUST be in place to
   prevent multicast packets leaking out of the TRILL campus.

   The following table summarizes the identification of different
   OAM frames from data frames.

   It is important to note that all RBridges MUST generate OAM flows

   off-set. However, well-known values MUST be utilized as part of
   the flow-entropy when generating OAM messages destined for older

Appendix B.                  Base Mode for TRILL OAM



   CFM, as defined in [8021Q], requires configuration of several
   parameters before the protocol can be used. These parameters
   include MAID, Maintenance Domain Level (MD-LEVEL) and MEPIDs. The
   Base Mode for TRILL OAM defined here facilitates ease of use and
   provides out of the box plug-and-play capabilities, supporting
   the Operational and Manageability considerations described in
   Section 6 of [RFC7174].

   All RBridges that support TRILL OAM MUST support Base Mode
   operation.

   All Rbridges MUST create a default MA with MAID as specified
   herein.

   MAID [8021Q] has a flexible format and includes two parts:
   Maintenance Domain Name and Short MA name. In the Based Mode of
   operation, the value of the Maintenance Domain Name must be the
   character string "TrillBaseMode" (excluding the quotes "). In
   Base Mode operation Short MA Name format is set to 2-octet
   integer format (value 3 in Short MA Format field) and Short MA
   name set to 65532 (0xFFFC).

   The Default MA belongs to MD-LEVEL 3.

   In the Base Mode of operation, each RBridge creates a single UP
   MEP associated with a virtual OAM port with no physical layer
   (NULL PHY). The MEPID associated with this MEP is the 2-octet
   RBridge Nickname.

   By default, all RBridges operating in the Base Mode for TRILL OAM
   are able to initiate LBM, PT and other OAM tools with no
   configuration.

   Implementations MAY provide default flow-entropy to be included
   in OAM messages. Content of the default flow-entropy is outside
   the scope of this document.

   Figure 23, below depicts encoding of MAID within CCM messages.
