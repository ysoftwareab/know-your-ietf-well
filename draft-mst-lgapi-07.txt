                           draft-mst-lgapi-07

Abstract

   This document introduces an application programming interface (API)
   to the web-based "Network Looking Glass" software.  Its purpose is to
   provide application programmers uniform access to the Looking Glass
   service and to analyze standardized response.

   The API interface is supposed to provide the same level of
   information as web-based interfaces, but in a computer-readable
   format.

1.  Introduction

   Many Internet service providers (ISPs) and Internet exchange points
   (IXPs) offer a complimentary web page to the general public, which
   gives insights to the backbone routing table, BGP neighbor
   information, or offered routes.

   The visitor may also execute a ping or traceroute command to a random
   target address.  Some ISPs even offer information about their
   multicast routing table including the mtrace command.  The amount and
   type of offered information is not limited.

   The service is mostly used for the purpose of troubleshooting and is
   known under the term of "Looking Glass".  The development of various
   Looking Glass software has led to different systems in usage, syntax,
   style, and in offered information.  The difference is of minor

   interest to human users, but accessing a Looking Glass web page by
   script is complicated, inefficient, and error-prone.

   Accessing a Looking Glass service by script is required for repeating
   tasks.  It could be a monitoring system which validates link
   availability or bandwidth usage.

   This leads to the requirement of a unified access method to the
   information provided by a Looking Glass.  This document is a proposal
   of an application programmers interface (API), which provides a
   common schema, list of arguments, and options when accessing a
   Looking Glass service.

   The transport protocol of choice is encrypted HTTP, the style of
   operation is REST, and the response format is JSON [RFC7159].

   The Looking Glass API is described as a language-independent concept.
   Consequently, any programming language, which satisfies API commands
   listed in the following chapters, is acceptable.

1.1.  Background

   The requirement of a uniform access to a Looking Glass service
   becomes important when multiple Looking Glasses are part of a
   monitoring system.  Implementing a web client and HTTP-parser for
   every kind of web-based Looking Glass is a time consuming workaround,
   however, the Looking Glass API is a much more viable, compatible, and
   scalable solution.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.3.  Syntax Notation

   This specification uses the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) of
   [RFC7159] arranged as JSend [JSend] compliant response.

1.4.  Examples

   All URLs in this documentation use the reserved sample domain of
   "example.net" as defined in [RFC6761] section 6.5.

   IPv4 addresses use the documenational block of 192.0.2.0/24 [RFC5737]
   and IPv6 addresses reside in the reserved prefix of 2001:DB8::/32

   [RFC3849].  BGP Autonomous System numbers are chosen from the private
   AS range defined in [RFC6996].

   The printed examples skip some required parameters for reasons of
   simplicity.

2.  Operation

   An API client issues a query using the HTTP GET method to request a
   specific resources from the API server.  The resource is a URI and
   can be informational or a command execution.  The client must present
   all necessary parameters for the API server to execute the command on
   the selected router.  Every API call is stateless and independent of
   the previous one.

   The "API call" is a request from the client, which specifies a pre-
   defined operation ("API function") that the server will execute on a
   selected router.  The "command" is a task executed on the router and
   initiated by the server on behalf of the client.  The type and scope
   of all commands is defined and limited by the server.  The client
   MUST NOT be able to execute random commands on the targeting router.
   There MUST NOT be any direct communication between the client and the
   router.

   After the execution of the command on the selected router has
   finished, the server replies to the client if the operation has
   either succeeded, failed or timed out.  The response is sent to the
   API client in JSON format.  The communication protocol used between
   the server and router is not specified by this document; any method
   (e.g.  Telnet, SSH, NETCONF, YANG, serial console) is acceptable.

   All parameters and its values are case insensitive.

2.1.  Method Parameters

   Method parameters are mandatory components of the URI and placed in
   the "path" section in terms of [RFC7320].  Basically, the method
   parameters specify the API call and determine which command the
   client wants executed on the selected router.

2.2.  Query Parameters

   Query parameters are optional components of the URI and placed in the
   "query" section in terms of [RFC7320].  Generally, the query
   parameters are additional instructions for the requested command.

   protocol

      Restrict the command and method parameters to use the specified
      protocol and version.  Protocol is selected as "Address Family
      Identifier" [IANA-AFN] [RFC2858] and optional "Subsequent Address
      Family Identifier" [IANA-SAFI] separated by comma.
      Default value is 1,1 (IP version 4, unicast).
      JSON data type is String.
      Examples:

      *  protocol=2,1 (IP version 6, unicast)

      *  protocol=26 (MPLS, no SAFI used)

   router
      Run the command on the router identified by its name.  This is not
      necessarily the routers hostname as long as the Looking Glass
      software recognizes it.
      Default value is the first router in the list of available
      routers.
      JSON data type is String.
      Example: router=rbgn06.example.net

   routerid
      Run the command on this router identified by its position in the
      list of available routers.
      Default value is "0".
      JSON data type is Number.
      Example: routerid=8

   random
      Append a random string to prevent the client (or an intermediate
      proxy) from caching the response.  The API server must ignore its
      value.
      No default value.
      JSON data type is String.
      Example: random=517A93B50

   runtime
      Stop executing the command after the runtime limit (in seconds) is
      exceeded.  A value of 0 disables the limit.
      Default value is "30".
      JSON data type is Number.
      Example: runtime=60

   format
      Request the server to provide the output (if any) in the selected
      format.  Specify multiple formats separated by comma in descending
      order of preference.  See Section 3.3.2 for more details.
      Default value is "text/plain" (raw/unformatted output).

      JSON data type is String.
      Example: format=application/yang,text/plain

2.3.  Response

   The HTTP response header SHOULD set an appropriate HTTP status code
   as defined in [RFC7231] and MUST set the Content-Type to
   "application/json".

   The HTTP body contains details and error descriptions.  The response
   text MUST comply with the JSON syntax specification JSend [JSend],
   which is briefly explained in appendix JSend.  Consequently every
   response MUST contain a "status" field of either "success", "fail",
   or "error", that are explained in the following sections.

2.3.1.  Success

   A successful response MUST set the "status" field to "success".  It
   MUST also contain a "data" object including the following
   information:

   performed_at
      combined date and time in UTC ISO 8601 [iso8601] indicating when
      the operation finished.  This information MUST be present.

   runtime
      amount of seconds (wallclock) used to run the command.  This
      information MUST be present.

   router
      the name of the router, that executed the command.  This
      information MAY be present.

   output
      output of the command in a format that was requested by the client
      or defaults to raw output as it appeared on the routers command
      line interface (CLI).  It might even be blank if the command did
      not produce any output.  This information SHOULD be present.

   format
      selected output format by the server.  The client might request
      multiple formats, so that the "Looking Glass" server has to choose
      the best option and tell the client which format was selected.
      This information SHOULD be present (or defaults to "text/plain" if
      missing).

   Adding more information to the response is permitted and MUST be
   placed inside the "data" object.

Internet-Draft              Looking Glass API               October 2017


   The HTTP status code SHOULD be 200.

   Example:

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/json
   {
     "status" : "success",
     "data" : {
       "router" : "route-server.lookingglass.example.net"
       "performed_at" : "2014-10-15T17:15:34Z",
       "runtime" : 2.63,
       "output" : [
         "full raw output from the observing router..."
       ],
       "format" : "text/plain"
     }
   }

2.3.2.  Fail

   A status of "fail" indicates that the selected command was executed
   on the router but failed to succeed.  The response message MUST set
   the "status" field to "fail" and MUST contain the "data" object with
   command-specific content, that is listed in Section 2.3.1.

   The HTTP status code SHOULD be 200.

   Example:

   HTTP/2.0 200 OK
   {
     "status" : "fail",
     "data" : {
       "performed_at" : "2014-10-18T20:04:37Z",
       "runtime" : 10.37,
       "output" : [
         "Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 192.0.2.5",
         ".....",
         "Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)"
       ],
       "format" : "text/plain",
       "router" : "route-server.lookingglass.example.net"
     }
   }

Internet-Draft              Looking Glass API               October 2017


2.3.3.  Error

   The status "error" represents an error which occurred in processing
   the request or the command timed out.  The response message MUST set
   the "status" field to "error" and MUST contain the "message" key,
   that keeps a meaningful message, explaining what went wrong.

   The response MAY contain the "data" key, with required values listed
   in Section 2.3.1.  It MAY also include a "code" field, that carries a
   numeric code corresponding to the error.

   The HTTP status code SHOULD be 400 in case of a client-side error,
   500 in case of a server-side error or 502 for errors occurring on the
   target router.  Code 504 SHOULD be used when a command timed out.

   Example:

   HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
   {
     "status" : "error",
     "message" : "Unrecognized host or address."
   }

3.  API functions

   The Looking Glass API provides functions that are either mandatory or
   optional to implement.  The same principle applies to the web-based
   Looking Glass.

   It is not possible for any API function to modify the server's state.
   Therefore, all HTTP methods are GET operations.

   Variables are templated and expanded in harmony of [RFC6570].

3.1.  Diagnostic commands

3.1.1.  Ping

   Send echo messages to validate the reachability of a remote host and
   measure round-trip time.  The "ping" command MAY use the ICMP
   protocol, but any protocol that satisfies the requirement is
   acceptable.

   Implementation of the ping command is mandatory.

   Syntax: https://lg.example.net/api/v1/ping/{addr}

   networks, next hop and MAY include metric, local preference, path
   list, weight, etc.

   Implementation of the "show bgp" command is optional.

   Syntax: https://lg.example.net/api/v1/show/bgp/{addr}

   Example:

   https://lg.example.net/api/v1/show/bgp/192.0.2.0/24

3.2.3.  show bgp summary

   Print a summary of BGP neighbor status.  This MAY include neighbor
   BGP ID, autonomous system number, duration of peering, number of
   received prefixes, etc.

   Implementation of the "show bgp summary" command is optional.

   Syntax: https://lg.example.net/api/v1/show/bgp/summary

   Example:

   details MAY include neighbor BGP ID, advertised networks, learned
   networks, autonomous system number, capabilities, protocol,
   statistics, etc.

   Implementation of the "show bgp neighbors" command is optional.

   Syntax: https://lg.example.net/api/v1/show/bgp/neighbors/{addr}

   Example:

   https://lg.example.net/api/v1/show/bgp/neighbors/192.0.2.226

3.3.  Administrative commands

   The following administrative commands MUST be included in the
   implementation.

3.3.1.  router list

   The command provides a full list of routers that are available for
   command execution.  This list includes the router ID and its name.
   It is equivalent to the common "router" HTML drop-down form element
   and contains the same information.

       "runtime" : 0.73
     }
   }

3.3.2.  router details

   List additional information about the selected router, specified by
   its router ID.  The response MUST contain the routers hostname and
   router ID.  The response MAY contain more details like output format,
   country code, city, administrative contact, vendor and model.

   Available output formats are specified by Internet media type as of
   [RFC6838] and listed in [IANA-MT].  If the routers supports multiple
   formats, they are separated by comma.

   The router might provide output formats, that are not yet registered
   or listed in [IANA-MT].  RFC6838 [RFC6838] provides a tree for
   unregistered subtypes.  For example, output in NETCONF format could
   use "text/x.netconf".

   Missing output format defaults to "text/plain", which is a copy of
   the raw command-line output.

   Syntax: https://lg.example.net/api/v1/routers/{number}

Internet-Draft              Looking Glass API               October 2017


3.4.  Extensible commands

   The list of commands MAY be expanded as long as the principles of
   this document are observed.

   For example, a Looking Glass provider may not be offering BGP-related
   commands because of an OSPF-based network.

   The sample command might be:

   https://lg.example.net/api/v1/show/ospf/database

4.  Miscellaneous

   The network traffic sent by a "Looking Glass" is not appropriate when
   measuring Service Level Agreements or validating Quality of Service
   setting.

   If a monitoring system uses the Looking Glass API for reachability
   checks, it SHOULD NOT rely on the HTTP status codes but on the
   "status" message field inside the HTTP body.

5.  IANA Considerations

   none

6.  Security Consideration

   The use of HTTPS is REQUIRED to ensure a high level of security,
   privacy, and confidentiality during transit.

6.1.  Abuse Potential

   The main goal of the Looking Glass API is the automated usage of the
   Looking Glass service.  This allows the scripting of API calls, which
   could be used as a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
   Interestingly, the attacked system recognizes the attack originating
   from various ISPs core network.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers of the Looking Glass API take
   steps to mitigate the above described abuse.  The strategy can
   include blocking or rate-limiting by client IP address or target IP
   network.

6.2.  Authentication

   Authentication is not a requirement because the current Looking Glass
   web services are usable without authentication.  Requests to the
   proposed API service MAY be authenticated by any method.  The
   decision is up to the implementers security requirements.

6.3.  Minimal information

   Some of the described commands provide a detailed insight into the
   providers network.  It is therefore up to the implementer's security
   policy to dismiss commands that are marked as "optional" or restrict
   commands that are marked as "mandatory".

Appendix A.  JSend

   According to [JSend], "JSend is a specification that lays down some
   rules for how JSON responses from web servers should be formatted.
   JSend focuses on application-level (as opposed to protocol- or

   transport-level) messaging which makes it ideal for use in REST-style
   applications and APIs."

   A basic JSend-compliant response MUST contain a "status" key and
   SHOULD contain "data", "message" and "code" keys dependent on the
   status value.  The following table lists the required and optional
   keys.

               +---------+-----------------+---------------+
               | Type    | Required keys   | Optional keys |

               | fail    | status, data    |               |
               | error   | status, message | code, data    |
