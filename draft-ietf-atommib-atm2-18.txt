   devices, and services in addition to those defined in the ATM-MIB
   [24], to provide additional support for the management of:

        - ATM Switched Virtual Connections (SVCs)
        - ATM Permanent Virtual Connections (PVCs)

   3.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events
      for the purpose of management.  The first version of this
      Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1
      and described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16,
      RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].  The second version,
      called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578],
      STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.
      The first version of the SNMP message protocol is called
      SNMPv1 and described in STD 15, RFC 1157[RFC1157].  A second
      version of the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet
      standards track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC
      1901 [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
      message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
      [RFC1906], RFC2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [RFC1905].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
      [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described in
      RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A

INTERNET-DRAFT      Supplemental ATM Managed Objects      April 25, 2002


   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

   4. Overview

   The purpose of this memo is to provide additional capabilities, not found
   in the ATM-MIB [24], which are needed to manage ATM interfaces.  This 
memo
   addresses the following areas:

        - ATM Switch Support
        - ATM Service Support
        - ATM Host Support

   In addition, this memo also provides ATM trap support.

   4.1 Background

   In addition to the MIB module defined in this memo, other MIB modules
   are necessary to manage ATM interfaces, links and cross-connects.
   Examples include MIB II for general system and interface
   management (RFC 1907 [5] and RFC 2863 [4]), the DS3 (RFC 2496 [31])
   or SONET MIBs (RFC 2558 [30]) for management of SONET and DS3 physical
   interfaces, and, as appropriate, MIB modules for applications that make
   use of ATM, such as SMDS [28] and LAN Emulation [27].  These MIB modules
   are outside the scope of this specification.

   This MIB module also requires the use of the ATM-MIB module defined in
   [24] and ATM-specific textual conventions defined in [34].

   ATM Endpoint applications such as ATM LAN Emulation or Classical
   IP-over-ATM Clients and Servers use ATM to establish
   SVC/PVC connections for exchanging control and data information.
   The agents of these ATM applications must provide the network
   manager with information on the SVC/PVCs in use and which
   applications are using them.  The information can be made
   generic so as to apply to all ATM applications.  This memo defines
   extensions to the ATM-MIB [24] in order to support this.

   The current specification of this supplemental ATM2-MIB is based on
   SNMPv2 SMI.

                    Table 1: MIB structure

   5.1.1 ATM SVC VP Cross-Connect Table

   This table provides the SVC VP Cross-Connect (SVPC) information.  The
   equivalent PVC VP Cross-Connect table is defined in [24].  This table
   also includes cross-connect information for Soft PVPs.

   This table contains configuration and state information of all SVC VP
   point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, or multipoint-to-multipoint VP
   cross-connects.

   This table has read-only access and can be used to monitor the
   cross-connects which connect the VPLs together in an ATM switch or
   network.  The atmSvcVpCrossConnectIndex is used to associate the
   related SVC VPLs that are cross-connected together.  The
   atmSvcVpCrossConnectRowStatus object has read-write access to allow
   for tear-down.

   The ATM SVC VP Cross-Connect Table models each bi-directional Switched
   Virtual Circuit (SVC) VP cross-connect as a set of entries in the
   atmSvcVpCrossConnectTable.  A point-to-point VPC cross-connect is
   modeled as one entry; a point-to-multipoint (N leafs) VPC cross-connect
   as N entries in this table; and a multipoint-to-multipoint (N parties)
   VPC cross-connect as N(N-1)/2 entries in this table.  In the latter
   cases, all the N (or N(N-1)/2) entries are associated with a single VPC
   cross-connect by having the same value of atmSvcVpCrossConnectIndex.

   The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical ordering of
   the two interfaces associated with a VPC cross-connect.  That is, the
   ATM interface with the lower value of ifIndex is termed 'low', while
   the other ATM interface associated with the VPC cross-connect is
   termed 'high'.

   equivalent PVC VC Cross-Connect table is defined in [24].  This table
   also includes cross-connect information for Soft PVCs.

   This table is used to model a bi-directional
   point-to-point, point-to-multipoint or
   multipoint-to-multipoint SVC VC cross-connect.

   This table has read-only access and is used
   to monitor the cross-connects which connect
   the VCLs together in an ATM switch
   or network that belong to a VC connection.  The
   atmSvcVcCrossConnectIndex is used to associate
   the related SVC VCLs that are cross-connected together.
   The atmSvcVcCrossConnectRowStatus object
   has read-write access to allow for tear-down.

   The ATM SVC VC Cross-Connect Table models each bi-directional
   Switched Virtual Circuit (SVC) VC cross-connect as a set of entries
   in the atmSvcVcCrossConnectTable.  A point-to-point VC cross-connect
   is modeled as one entry; a point-to-multipoint (N leafs) VC
   cross-connect as N entries in this table; and a multipoint-to-multipoint
   (N parties) VPC cross-connect as N(N-1)/2 entries in this table.
   In the latter cases, all the N (or N(N-1)/2) entries are associated
   with a single VPC cross-connect by having the same value of
   atmSvcVcCrossConnectIndex.

   The terms low and high are chosen to represent numerical ordering of
   the two interfaces associated with a VPC cross-connect.  That is, the
   ATM interface with the lower value of ifIndex is termed 'low', while
   the other ATM interface associated with the VPC cross-connect is
   termed 'high'.

   5.1.3 ATM Interface Signalling Statistics Table

   This table provides statistical information of the signalling entity.
   A signalling entity can be deployed over an ATM interface as defined
   in the atmInterfaceConfTable [24], a logical ATM interface defined in
   section 5.1.10.1 in this document, or a proprietary virtual interface

   5.1.4 ATM Signalling Capability Support

   A number of Information Elements may or may not be supported by ATM
   switches or ATM Services.  Hence, for trouble isolation it is important
   to keep track which particular Information Elements are supported.  The
   corresponding group of objects must be supported by switches or services
   supporting SVCs, and indicate whether the following Information Elements
   are enabled/disabled:

   1)   Calling party number

   2)   Calling party subaddress

   carrier to which intercarrier calls originated from this interface are
   routed when transit network selection information is not provided by
   the calling party.

   5.1.5 Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table

   This table extends the ATM VCL table of the
   ATM-MIB [24] to include all other necessary signalling information as
   specified in the ATM Forum UNI Specifications [25] and [26].
   A user can create an entry with all signalling parameters
   and later use that entry to specify the signalling
   characteristics of SVCs.

   Some of the signalling parameters, such as the AAL5 parameters 
information
   element, are reflected in the VCL and VPL tables, and this table only
   contains the remaining AAL5 parameters.

   Signalling attributes can be grouped into following categories:

      1) ATM Adaptation Layer Parameters

      Information in this group is captured in the
      ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table defined
      in this memo.  Please refer to section 5.4.5.5 of
      [25] and [26].

      2) Broadband High Layer Information

      Information in this group is captured by the
      ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table defined
      in this memo.  Please refer to section 5.4.5.8 of
      [25] and [26].

      3) Broadband Low Layer Information

      Information in this group is captured by the
      ATM Signalling Descriptor Parameter Table defined
      in this memo.  Please refer to section 5.4.5.9 of
      [25] and [26].

   5.1.6 ATM Interface Registered Address Table

   This table contains a list of ATM addresses that can be used for calls
   to and from a given interface by a switch or service.  The ATM addresses
   are either registered by the endsystem via ILMI or statically configured.

   5.1.7 ATM VPI/VCI to Address Mapping Table

   In the atmVclAddrTable, the object atmVclAddrAddr can
   either be an ATM Local Address or an ATM Remote Address which represent
   the two endpoint addresses of a VCL.  ATM Local Address
   identifies the local endpoint of the VCL represented by this
   agent.  The ATM Remote address represents the address of
   the ATM application at the other end of the VCL.

   5.1.8 ATM Address to VPI/VCI Mapping Table

   This table provides an alternative way to retrieve
   the atmVclTable.  This table can be used to retrieve the
   indexing to the atmVclTable by an ATM address.

   5.1.9 ATM VPL Statistics Table

   The atmVplStatTable includes per-VPL cell counters.  The VPL cell 
counters
   count the valid ATM cells.  The valid ATM cells include the user and OAM
   cells but exclude the physical layer (e.g., idle cells) and unassigned 
cells.
   Cells coming into an ATM managed system are counted differently with the
   high Cell Loss Priority (CLP=0) or low Cell Loss Priority (CLP=1).
   The cells are tagged, passed or discarded
   depending on the incoming CLP value and the policed cell rate by the
   "traffic policing" entity in the ATM managed system.  Refer to
   [25] and [26] for a description of the traffic policing.

   In the switch where the traffic policing is not supported, cells are
   passed or discarded depending on the bandwidth and buffering capacity
   of the switching fabric.
   The Output Tagged Cells counter, in this case, is always zero.

          Figure 5: ATM Cell Counters per VPL


   In this table, cells coming into and out of the managed ATM system are
   counted as the total number of cells and the cells with the CLP=0.  The
   CLP=1 counter is derived by subtracting CLP=0 cells from the total cells.
   In addition, cells that are tagged on the output are also counted.  The
   output CLP=1 cells equals the total cells out count minus both the
   CLP=0 cells and the tagged cells.

   5.1.10 ATM VPL Logical Port Table

   The ATM VPL Logical Port Table includes all ATM logical port interface
   configuration information.

   5.1.10.1 ATM Logical Port Interface

   The interface type "ATM Logical Port" (ifType=80) is defined to allow
   the representation of a VP Tunnel, which is a VPL used as a trunk
   connection (most likely between devices that are not physically
   adjacent), providing for multiplexing and demultiplexing of VCs on
   the VP.  Figure 6 illustrates such a VP Tunnel.

   Note: the "ATM Logical Port" interface is more of a logical port,
   compared with an interface of type "ATM" which is more of a physical
   port that provides for the transport of many VP and VC connections
   between adjacent devices.

   In Figure 6, a VP tunnel (denoted as VPL1 by Switch A, and as VPL2 by
   Switch B) is used to connect VCL1 with VCL4 and VCL2 with VCL3.
   Figure 6 shows only one VP tunnel, but there can be multiple VP tunnels

   over the same physical interface.

   A particularly useful VP tunnel scenario is tunneling across a public
   network that does not support signalling.  In Figure 6 above, assume
   Switches A and B are private switches that signal over the VP to set
   up connections transparently through the public network.  The public
   network would just transport a PVC VP between the two switches.

   Because the VP Tunnel constitutes an interface between two ATM devices
   that are not necessarily physically adjacent, most of the management
   information pertaining to the interface may differ for the tunnel,
   including:

           - active VPI/VCI fields (the tunnel may be a subset
             of the parent interface).
           - maximum number of VCCs
           - configured VCCs
           - ILMI VPI/VCI values
           - ATM address type
           - ATM administrative address
           - received/transmitted cells.


   5.1.10.2 How to create an ATM Logical Port interface

   On ATM devices supporting VP tunnels, the ATM Logical Port Interface 
Table
   can be used to create VP tunnels.  To create an ATM Logical Port 
interface
   via SNMP:

       - Create a VPL (e.g., VPI=a on an existing ATM interface
         which has ifIndex=x) in the atmVplTable.

       - Set the object atmVplLogicalPortDef to isLogicalIf.
         A new row in the ifTable is then created by the agent,
         with ifIndex=y, to represent the ATM Logical Port
         interface.  The object atmVplLogicalPortIndex is also
         set to y by the agent to represent the ifIndex value of
         the ATM Logical Port interface.

       - The ifEntry values are set for the ATM Logical
         Port interface (ifIndex=y) as discussed in RFC
         2515, with the following exceptions:
             * ifType - a new enumerated value of atmLogical(80)
               was added to IANAifType, specifying an "ATM
               Logical Port" interface.
             * ifSpeed - The total bandwidth in bits per
               second for use by the ATM layer.  Computed
               from the traffic descriptor for the VPL.

             * ifOperStatus - determined hierarchically,
               depending on the state of the physical
               atm-cell layer interface beneath it,
               and the ILMI on the VP.
             * ifInOctets, ifOutOctets - support of
               these objects is not mandatory for ATM
               Logical Port interfaces.
             * ifInErrors - always zero, HEC errors are
               specified for the atm cell-layer interface
               beneath it.
             * ifInUnknownProtos - always zero, errors
               are specified for the atm cell-layer
               interface beneath it.

       - The atmInterfaceConfEntry values are set and reported
         as discussed in [24], with the following exceptions:
             * atmInterfaceMaxVpcs - 0.
             * atmInterfaceConfVpcs - 0.
             * atmInterfaceIlmiVpi - VPI of the VP tunnel.

       - The atmInterfaceExtEntry values are set and reported
         as follows:
             * atmInterfaceConfMaxSvpcVpi - VPI of the VP tunnel,
               although VPCs cannot be setup on a VP tunnel.
             * atmInterfaceCurrentMaxSvpcVpi - VPI of VP tunnel,
               although VPCs cannot be setup on a VP tunnel.
             * atmInterfaceConfMaxSvccVpi - VPI of the VP tunnel.
             * atmInterfaceCurrentMaxSvccVpi - VPI of VP tunnel.
             * atmIntfPvcFailures - Includes failures of PVCLs
               within the VP tunnel, but not of the PVPL itself,
               since those are reported on the atm(37) interface.
             * atmIntfCurrentlyFailingPVpls - 0.
             * atmIntfPvcFailuresTrapEnable - Enables traps for
               PVCL failures within the VP tunnel, but not for
               the PVPL itself, since the latter are generated on
               behalf of the atm(37) interface.

       - An entry is created in the ifStackTable, with
         values: ifStackHigherLayer=y, ifStackLowerLayer=x.

       - VCLs defined on the VP tunnel are indexed by
         ifIndex=y, VPI=a, VCI.

   The ATM Interface Configuration Extension Table contains ATM interface
   information that supplements the atmInterfaceConfTable defined in [24].
   It includes the configuration information of the interface type (i.e.,
   connection setup procedures) and ILMI.

   A network manager can configure the interface to run a specific type of
   connection setup procedures (i.e., protocol and version) such as ITU-T
   DSS2, ATM Forum UNI 3.1, PNNI 1.0 or BICI 2.0.  It can also dictate the
   role of the managed entity as one side of the interface.  For example,
   if an interface is configured to run ATM Forum UNI 3.1, the managed
   entity has to be told to run as either the network side or the user
   side of the UNI.

   The objects atmIntfConfigType and atmIntfConfigSide are used for
   configuration and the objects atmIntfActualType and atmIntfActualSide
   are used for reading back the actual interface protocol and version.

   The following table describes all the valid combinations of
   configuration of the interface type and side.  Note that the value N/A 
meaning not applicable, should be set to the value other(1) when used.

           atmIntfConfigType          atmIntfConfigSide

           atmfNniPvcOnly             N/A

   When the value of the object atmIntfConfigType is configured to
   autoConfig(2), the interface type is determined via the ATM Forum
   ILMI auto-configuration procedures [29].  There is no need to set
   the interface side since it should be a derived value.  The PNNI
   and BICI interfaces are always symmetric so setting the interface
   side is also not necessary.

   This table also includes the configured and negotiated maximum VPI
   value per ATM interface, and the configured and negotiated minimum VCI
   value per ATM interface.  Refer to [29] Sections 8.2.3.8 through
   8.2.3.10 for a detailed description.

   The following figure provides an example how the current minimum VCI

   values are derived from the configured minimum VCI values and the
   neighboring minimum VCI values:

                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 40  (negotiated)

            ifB:  Configured Min SVCC VCI = 40  (configured)
                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 40  (negotiated)

            ifC:  Configured Min SVCC VCI = 32  (configured)
                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 32  (negotiated)

            ifD:  Configured Min SVCC VCI = 32  (configured)
                  Current Min SVCC VCI    = 32  (negotiated)


        Between ifA and ifB, the maximum of the two vales for
        atmInterfaceConfMinSvccVci is 40, so both interfaces set
        their atmInterfaceCurrentMinSvccVci values to 40.  On
        the other hand, since ifC and ifD both are configured
        with atmInterfaceConfMinSvccVci values of 32, they set
        their atmInterfaceCurrentMinSvccVci values to 32.

   When querying the ILMI service registry table, through the
   ILMI protocol:
    - the device attached to interface if1 will obtain the
      address a and b.
    - the device attached to interface if2 will obtain the
      address a only.
    - the device attached to interface if3 will obtain the
      address a and b.


   5.1.15  ILMI Network Prefix Table

   A table specifying per-interface network prefix(es) supplied by the
   network side of the UNI during ILMI address registration.  When no
   network prefixes are specified for a particular interface, one or
   more network prefixes based on the switch address(es) may be used
   for ILMI address registration.

   5.1.16  ATM Switch Address Table

   This table contains one or more ATM endsystem addresses on a per-switch
   basis.  These addresses are used to identify the switch.  When no ILMI
   network prefixes are configured for certain interfaces, network prefixes
   based on the switch address(es) may be used for ILMI address 
registration.

   5.1.17  AAL5 per-VCC Statistics Table

   This table contains the AAL5 statistics for the VCCs.

   5.1.18  ATM VP Cross-Connect Extension Table

   This table extends the atmVpCrossConnectTable defined in ATM-MIB [24].

   5.1.19  ATM VC Cross-Connect Extension Table

   This table extends the atmVcCrossConnectTable defined in ATM-MIB [24].

   5.1.20  Currently Failing PVPL Table

   This table contains all the PVPLs that are in trouble.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Supplemental ATM Managed Objects      April 25, 2002


   This table contains all the PVCLs that are in trouble.

   5.1.22  Leaf Initiated Join Counter support

   Two counter objects are added to count the number of leaf intiated
   setup requests and setup failures.

   5.2  Network and User Addresses

   At the user side of a given ATM UNI interface there may be an address,
   "ifPhysAddress", to identify the interface.  In addition, there may be
   several other addresses which can be used to originate and receive calls.
   These other addresses that are used to receive calls are listed in the
   "ifRcvAddrTable" defined in RFC 2863 [4].  The registered addresses on
   the network side are listed in the ATM Registered Address Table.  The
   ATM Registered Address Table is supported by switches and network
   services.  It is not supported by hosts.

   5.3 Configuration of VPLs, VCLs, and Cross-Connects

   The ATM Managed Objects needed to support the configuration of VPLs,
   VCLs, and Cross-Connects of the Permanent VPLs and VCLs are defined in
   the ATM-MIB [24].  Cross-Connects of the Switched VPLs and VCLs are
   defined in this memo.

   5.4 ATM-related Trap Support

   Traps are defined to detect changes in the status of permanent VPLs
   and VCLs.  The current up/down status of each permanent VPL or VCL
   is indicated by the atmVplOperStatus or atmVclOperStatus object,
   respectively.  Several tables and objects and one trap are defined
   in order to help network managers quickly and efficiently detect
   changes in the status of permanent virtual links.  Through use of
   these tables, objects, and traps, the time consuming and resource
   intensive task of continuously polling each row in the entire
   atmVplTable and atmVclTable can be avoided.

   The atmIntfPvcFailures counter and the atmIntfCurrentlyFailingPVpls
   and atmIntfCurrentlyFailingPVcls gauges provide a quick means of
   determining the status of all PVPLs and PVCLs on an interface.  The
   atmCurrentlyFailingPVplTable and the atmCurrentlyFailingPVclTable
   list all of the problematic PVPLs and PVCLs, respectively, allowing
   them to be quickly identified.

   The atmIntfPvcFailuresTrap is generated just after a PVPL or PVCL on
   a particular interface leaves the `up' operational state.  Managers can
   then determine which PVPLs and/or PVCLs are failing by reading the
   atmCurrentlyFailingPVplTable and the atmCurrentlyFailingPVclTable.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Supplemental ATM Managed Objects      April 25, 2002


   Generation of the atmIntfPvcFailuresTrap is rate limited by suppressing
   all traps that would occur within atmIntfPvcNotificationInterval of a
   previous trap for the same interface.  Managers should continuously poll
   the tables and objects mentioned above for at least this amount of time
   in order to keep up with the state of the network.

   10. Security Considerations

INTERNET-DRAFT      Supplemental ATM Managed Objects      April 25, 2002


   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
   that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  The support for SET operations in a
   non-secure environment without proper protection can have a
   negative effect on network operations.

   Many managed objects in this MIB
   contain information that may be considered
   sensitive since they contain interface configuration
   information.
   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects
   and possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when
   sending them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of
   SNMP provide features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the
   network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then,
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed
   to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in
   this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the
   use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
   SET (change/create/delete) them.
