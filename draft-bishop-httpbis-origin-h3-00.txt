                     The ORIGIN Extension in HTTP/3
                   draft-bishop-httpbis-origin-h3-00

Abstract

   The ORIGIN frame for HTTP/2 is equally applicable to HTTP/3, but
   needs to be separately registered.  This document describes the
   ORIGIN frame for HTTP/3.

1.  Introduction

   Existing RFCs define extensions to HTTP/2 [HTTP2] which remain useful
   in HTTP/3.  Appendix A.2.3 of [HTTP3] describes the required updates
   for HTTP/2 frames to be used with HTTP/3.

   [ORIGIN] defines the HTTP/2 ORIGIN frame, which indicates what
   origins are available on a given connection.  It defines a single
   HTTP/2 frame type.

2.  Basic Mapping Conventions

3.  The ORIGIN HTTP/3 Frame

   The ORIGIN HTTP/3 frame allows a server to indicate what origin(s)
   ([RFC6454]) the server would like the client to consider as members
   of the Origin Set (Section 2.3 of [ORIGIN]) for the connection within
   which it occurs.

   Where HTTP/2 reserves Stream 0 for frames related to the state of the
   connection, HTTP/3 defines a pair of unidirectional streams called
   "control streams" for this purpose.  Where [ORIGIN] indicates that
   the ORIGIN frame should be sent on Stream 0, this should be
   interpreted to mean the HTTP/3 control stream.  The ORIGIN frame is
   sent from servers to clients on the server's control stream.

   The layout and semantics of the frame payload are identical to those
   of the HTTP/2 frame defined in [ORIGIN].  The ORIGIN frame type is
   0xc (decimal 12), as in HTTP/2.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document introduces no new security considerations beyond those
   discussed in [ORIGIN] and [HTTP3].

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a frame type in the "HTTP/3 Frame Type"
   registry ([HTTP3]).

                  +============+=======+===============+
                  | Frame Type | Value | Specification |
                  +============+=======+===============+
                  | ORIGIN     |  0xc  | Section 3     |
                  +------------+-------+---------------+
