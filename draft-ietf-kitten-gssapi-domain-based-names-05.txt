Internet-Draft           GSS Domain Based Names            December 2007


Abstract

   This document describes domainname-based service principal names and
   the corresponding name type for the Generic Security Service
   Application Programming Interface (GSS-API).  Internationalization of
   the GSS-API is also covered.

   Domain-based service names are similar to host-based service names,
   but using a domain name (not necessarily an Internet domain name) in
   addition to a hostname.  The primary purpose of domain-based names is
   to provide a measure of protection to applications that utilize
   insecure service discovery protocols.  This is achieved by providing
   a way to name clustered services after the "domain" which they
   service, thereby allowing their clients to authorize the service's
   servers based on authentication of their service names.

Internet-Draft           GSS Domain Based Names            December 2007


2.  Introduction

   Some applications need to discover the names of servers for a
   specific resource.  Some common methods for server discovery are
   insecure, e.g., queries for DNS [RFC1035] SRV resource records
   [RFC2782] without using DNSSEC [RFC4033] and subject to attacks
   whereby a client can be re-directed to incorrect and possibly
   malicious servers.  A client may even be re-directed to a server that
   has credentials for itself and may thus authenticate itself to the
   client, and yet it could be incorrect or malicious (because it has
   been compromised, say).

   Domain-based names allow for GSS-API [RFC2743] initiator applications
   (clients) to authorize acceptor principals (servers) to serve the
   resource for which the client used insecure server discovery without
   either securing the server discovery method nor requiring an
   additional protocol for server authorization -- either a discovered
   server has credentials for authenticating the domain-based service
   names that it is intended to respond to, or it does not.
   Availability of valid credentials for authenticating domain-based
   names embodies the authorization of a given server to a domain-wide
   service.

   A domain-based name consists of three required elements:

   o  a service name

   o  a domain name

   o  a hostname

   The domain name and the hostname should be Domain Name System (DNS)
   names, though domain-based names could be used in non-DNS
   environments.  Because of the use of DNS names we must also provide
   for internationalization of the GSS-API.

   Note that domain-based naming isn't new.  According to a report to
   the KITTEN WG mailing list there exists at least one implementation
   of LDAP which uses domain-based service naming, and the DIGEST-MD5
   HTTP/SASL mechanism [RFC2831] describes a similar notion (see section
   2.1.2, description of the "serv-name" field of the digest-response).

3.  IANA Considerations

3.1.  Name Type OID and Symbolic Name

   IANA is requested to assign a new OID for the new GSS-API name type
   defined in this document.  This OID should have the following prefix:

   {iso(1) org(3) dod(6) internet(1) security(5) nametypes(6) gss-
   domain-based(5)}

   The recommended symbolic name for this GSS-API name type is
   "GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE".

Internet-Draft           GSS Domain Based Names            December 2007


4.  Query and Display Syntaxes

   There is a single name syntax for domain-based names.  It is
   expressed using the ABNF [RFC4234].

   The syntax is:

      domain-based-name =

         service "@" domain "@" hostname

      hostname =

         domain

      domain

         sub-domain 1*("." sub-domain)

      sub-domain

         Let-dig [Ldh-str]

      Let-dig

         ALPHA / DIGIT

      Ldh-str

         *( ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" ) Let-dig

   Where <service> is defined in Section 4.1 of [RFC2743].  Other rules
   not defined above are defined in Appendix B.1 of [RFC4234].

4.1.  Examples of domain-based names

   These examples are not normative:

   o  ldap@somecompany.example@ds1.somecompany.example

   o  nfs@somecompany.example@nfsroot1.somecompany.example

   The .example top-level domain is used here in accordance with
   [RFC2606].

5.  Internationalization (I18N) considerations

   We introduce new versions of GSS_Import_name() and GSS_Display_name()
   to better support Unicode.  Additionally we provide for the use of
   ACE-encoded DNS in the non-internationalized interfaces [RFC3490].

5.1.  Importing internationalized names

   When the input_name_type parameter is the
   GSS_C_NT_DOMAINBASED_SERVICE OID then GSS_Import_name()
   implementations and GSS-API mechanisms MUST accept ACE-encoded
   internationalized domain names in the hostname and domain name slots
   of the given domain-based name string.

   Support for non-ASCII internationalized domain names SHOULD be
   provided through a new function, GSS_Import_name_utf8(), that
   operates exactly like GSS_Import_name(), except that it MUST accept
   internationalized domain names both, as UTF-8 strings and as ACE-
   encoded strings via its input_name_string argument.

5.2.  Displaying internationalized names

   Implementations of GSS_Display_name() MUST only output US-ASCII or
   ACE-encoded internationalized domain names in the hostname and domain
   name slots of domain-based names (or mechanism names (MN) that
   conform to the mechanism's form for domain-based names).

   Support for non-ASCII internationalized domain names SHOULD be
   provided through a new function, GSS_Display_name_utf8(), that
   operates exactly like GSS_Display_name(), except that it outputs
   UTF-8 strings via its name_string output argument.
   GSS_Display_name_utf8() MUST NOT output ACE-encoded internationalized
   domain names.

6.  Application protocol examples

   The following examples are not normative.  They describe how the
   author envisions two applications' use of domain-based names.

6.1.  NFSv4 domain-wide namespace root server discovery

   Work is ongoing to provide a method for constructing domain-wide
   NFSv4 [RFC3530] filesystem namespaces where there is a single "root"
   with one or more servers (replicas) and multiple filesystems glued
   into the namespace through use of "referrals."  Clients could then
   construct a "global" namespace through use of the DNS domain
   hierarchy.

   Here clients would always know, from context, when they need to find
   the root servers for a given DNS domain.  Root server discovery would
   be performed using DNS SRV RR lookups, without using DNSSEC where
   DNSSEC has not been deployed.

   When using RPCSEC_GSS [RFC2203] for security NFSv4 clients would then
   use domain-based names to ensure that that the servers named in the
   SRV RRs are in fact authorized to be the NFSv4 root servers for the
   target domain.

6.2.  LDAP server discovery

   LDAP clients using the GSS-API through SASL too would benefit from
   use of domain-based names to protect server discovery through
   insecure DNS SRV RR lookups, much as described above.

   Unlike NFSv4 clients, not all LDAP clients may always know from
   context when they should use domain-based names.  That's because
   existing clients may use host-based naming to authenticate servers
   discovered through SRV RR lookups.  Changing such clients to use
   domain-based naming when domain-based acceptor credentials have not
   been deployed to LDAP servers, or when LDAP servers have not been
   modified to allow use of domain-based naming, would break
   interoperability.  That is, there is a legacy server interoperability
   issue here.  Therefore LDAP clients may require additional
   configuration at deployment time to enable (or disable) use of
   domain-based naming.

   Note: whether SASL [RFC4422] or its GSS-API bridges [RFC4752]
   [I-D.josefsson-sasl-gs2] require updates in order allow use of
   domain-based names is not relevant to the theory of how domain-based
   naming would protect LDAP clients' server discovery.

7.  Security Considerations

   Use of GSS-API domain-based names may not be negotiable by some GSS-
   API mechanisms, and some acceptors may not support GSS-API domain-
   based names.  In such cases initiators are left to fallback on the
   use of hostbased names, in which case the initiators MUST also verify
   that the acceptor's hostbased name is authorized to provide the given
   service for the domain that the initiator had wanted.

   The above security consideration also applies to all GSS-API
   initiators who lack support for domain-based service names.
