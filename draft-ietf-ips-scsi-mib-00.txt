                  1.  The SNMP Management Framework 
                   
                  The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
                  components: 
                   
                     o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

                  SCSI MIB                                  January 2002 
                
                     o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for 
                         the purpose of management.  The first version of this 
                         Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and 
                         described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and 
                         RFC 1215 [4].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described 
                         in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 
                         2580 [7]. 
                   
                     o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
                         first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 
                         and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of 
                         the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards 
                         track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 
                         [9] and RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message 
                         protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 
                         2572 [11] and RFC2574[12]. 
                   
                     o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
                         first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
                         described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol 
                         operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
                         [13]. 
                   
                     o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] 
                         and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 
                         2575[15]. 
                   
                  A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
                  Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16]. 
                   
                  Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
                  the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
                  defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
                   
                  This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
                  MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
                  translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
                  equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
                  translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
                  information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
                  SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
                  readable information is not considered to change the semantics of 
                  the MIB.

                  SCSI MIB                                  January 2002 
                
                  3.  Overview 
                   
                  This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
                  for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
                  In particular, it describes a set of managed objects to configure 
                  and monitor Small Computer System Interface entities (SCSI 
                  entities), i.e. SCSI devices, SCSI targets and Initiators and SCSI 
                  Ports. The MIB is based on documents issued by the T-10 Technical 
                  Committee and specially on SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2) 
                  document [17]. 
                   
                   
                  The SCSI protocol is a client-server protocol allowing an 
                  application layer client to transmit commands to a device server and 
                  to a task manager using an interconnect subsystem. 
                  The client side is referred as the initiator side and the server 
                  side is referred as the target side. 
                  A target includes a collection of logical units; each logical unit 
                  has a task manager allowing an initiator to execute commands. 
                   
                  3.1 Introduction 
                  In the late 1970s a firm called Shugart Associates started to have 
                  some considerable success with a peripheral interface definition in 
                  what became the PC marketplace, and this interface was adopted 
                  and extended by an open standards committee to form the Small 
                  Computer Systems Interface (SCSI).  
                  SCSI defined an 8 bit wide multi-drop ÊÊbus∆∆ structure which could 
                  interconnect a total of eight peripherals and computer systems. 
                
                  It∆s important to realize that all SCSI initially standardized was 
                  the ÊÊphysical connection∆∆ i.e. the connectors, cables and interface 
                  signals. Thus even though a peripheral could be connected to 
                  multiple systems, the information that flowed across the interface 
                  was different in each case.  
                  This was addressed some five years later by the definition of a 
                  Common Command Set, and with this definition in place it was 
                  possible for the first time to develop a peripheral with both a 
                  common interface and common operating firmware for connection to 
                  multiple systems. 
                   
                  The physical interface of SCSI continued to be developed throughout 
                  the 1980s with the addition of fast (up to 10 megabytes/s) and wide 
                  (16 bits) variants, but the distance supported remained a maximum of 
                  25 meters (from one end of the bus to another), and indeed some of 
                  the faster variants supported much less than that distance. The 
                  command set development continued, with special commands for tapes, 
                  printers, and even processors being added to the original disk-
                  oriented set.  
                  So successful was SCSI in the 1980s that the majority of the 
                  available Operating Systems incorporated support for the SCSI 
                  command set as standard.

                  However at the end of the 1980s the distance, speed and number of 
                  devices supported by SCSI were starting to become significant 
                  impediments to systems design, and while the "information explosion" 
                  had not yet started in earnest, it was already being anticipated. At 
                  the same time, the serial interface technologies developed for Local 
                  Area Networks such as Ethernet, and the fibre optics technologies 
                  that were first deployed in telecommunications applications, were 
                  starting to appear sufficiently rugged & low-cost for use in 
                  peripheral interface applications.  
                  Thus a standards project was begun in 1988 to develop a new serial, 
                  fibre-optic interface to carry the SCSI command sets and other 
                  peripheral protocols. This interface eventually became known as 
                  Fibre Channel (FC), and it is based on an architecture centered 
                  around an abstractly-defined "fabric", which may be a switch or a 
                  loop connection. MIBs for various FC equipments are already in 
                  existence. 
                   
                  In order to support the new interfaces, it was necessary to 
                  completely reorganize the SCSI standards and definitions. The 
                  command sets were separated from the physical interface definitions, 
                  and a SCSI Architectural Model (SAM) was created to define the 
                  interaction between the various standards. It is a key to 
                  understanding SAM to realize that it was first created approximately 
                  10 years AFTER the first SCSI products were shipped!! 
                   
                  The most recent development in this saga occurred in 2000 when an 
                  IETF Working Group was formed to address, amongst other things, a 
                  definition for transporting the SCSI command sets directly over a 
                  TCP/IP infrastructure. This effort is know as iSCSI, and an iSCSI 
                  MIB is already under development.

                  SCSI MIB                                  January 2002 
                
                  3.2 SCSI Terminology 
                  The definitions below are part of T.10 Proposal for SAM-2 [17]. They 
                  are copied from [17]. 
                   
                  3.2.1 SCSI application layer 
                  The protocols and procedures that implement or invoke SCSI commands 
                  and task management functions by using services provided by a SCSI 
                  protocol layer. 
                   
                  3.2.2 SCSI Device 
                  A SCSI device is an entity that contains one or more SCSI ports that 
                  are connected to a service delivery subsystem and supports a SCSI 
                  application protocol. 
                   
                  3.2.3 SCSI Port 
                  A device-resident object that connects the application client, 
                  device server or task manager to the service delivery subsystem 
                  through which requests and responses are routed. SCSI port is 
                  synonymous with port and either a SCSI initiator port or a SCSI 
                  target port. 
                
                  3.2.4 SCSI Initiator Device 
                  A SCSI initiator device contains application clients and SCSI 
                  initiator ports that originate device service and task management 
                  requests to be processed by a target SCSI device. When used this 
                  term refers to SCSI initiator devices or SCSI target/initiator 
                  devices that are using the SCSI target/initiator port as a SCSI 
                  initiator port. 
                   
                  3.2.5 SCSI Initiator Port 
                  A SCSI initiator device object acts as the connection between 
                  application clients and the service delivery subsystem through which 
                  requests and responses are routed. In all cases when this term is 
                  used it refers to an initiator port or a SCSI target/initiator port 
                  operating as a SCSI initiator port. 
                   
                  3.2.6 SCSI Target Device 
                  A SCSI device containing logical units and SCSI target ports that 
                  receives device service and task management requests for processing. 
                  When used this term refers to SCSI target devices or SCSI 
                  target/initiator devices that are using the SCSI target/initiator 
                  port as a SCSI target port. 
                   
                  3.2.7 SCSI Target Port 
                  A SCSI target device object contains a task router and acts as the 
                  connection between device servers and task managers and the service 
                  delivery subsystem through which requests and responses are routed. 
                  When this term is used it refers to a SCSI target port or a SCSI 
                  target/initiator port operating as a SCSI target port.

                  3.2.8 Logical Units 
                  A entity residing in the target that implements a device model and 
                  processes SCSI commands sent by an application client. 
                   
                  3.2.9 Logical Unit Number 
                  Logical Unit Number or LUN is a 64-bit identifier for a logical 
                  unit. 
                   
                  3.2.10 Nexus 
                  A nexus is a relationship between two SCSI devices and the initiator 
                  and target objects within those SCSI devices. 
                         I_T Nexus:     A nexus between an initiator and a target 
                         I_T_L Nexus:   A nexus between an initiator, a target and a 
                                        logical unit. 
                         I_T_L_Q Nexus: A nexus between an initiator, a target, a 
                                        logical unit and a tagged task. 
                         I_T_L_x Nexus: Either am I_T_L nexus or an I_T_L_Q nexus. 
                          
                  3.2.11 Interconnect subsystem 
                  One or more physical interconnects that appear as a single path for 
                  the transfer of information between SCSI devices. 
                   
                  3.2.12 Device Server 
                  A device server is an object within the logical unit that processes 
                  SCSI tasks according to the rules for task management. 
                   
                  3.2.13 Task Manager 
                  A task manager is a server within the target that processes task 
                  management functions. 
                   
                   
                   
                   
                  4.Structure of the MIB 
                    This MIB is composed as traditionally with three main groups: 
                         . scsiObjects 
                         . scsiNotifications 
                         . scsiConformance 
                   
                    The scsiObjects group is composed itself of five groups: 
                     
                  4.1 General Group 
                    The scsiGeneral group contains the parameters general to the 
                  managed scsi entity. 
                   
                  4.2 Device Group 
                    The scsiDevice group contains the characteristics of the managed 
                  SCSI device itself. Note that a SCSI entity may contain more than 
                  one SCSI device.  
                  This group contains also the characteristics of a managed generic 
                  SCSI port. Note that a SCSI device may contain more than one SCSI 
                  port.

                  4.3 Initiator Group 
                    The scsiInitiator group contains all the managed information 
                  related to an initiator device and port. 
                   
                  4.4 Target Group 
                    The scsiTarget group contains all the managed information related 
                  to a target device and port. 
                   
                  4.5 Logical Unit Group 
                    The scsiLogicalUnit group contains all the managed information 
                  concerning logical units, LUN hierarchy and logical unit 
                  identifiers. 
                  This group could be located under the target group. 
                   
                   
                
                
                  5.Relationship to Other MIBs 
                     
                  5.1 Host Resource MIB 
                    This portion of MIB extends those managed objects to SCSI specific 
                  entities but doesn't contain reference to software like device

                  SCSI MIB                                  January 2002 
                
                  6.1 Names and Identifiers 
                    The names and the identifiers of the SCSI devices, ports and 
                    logical units depends on the underlying transport protocols; their 
                    format and length vary accordingly. Please refer to [20] in order 
                    to get more details. 
                    Therefore, inspired by the RFC2851, textual conventions were added 
                    accordingly. 
                     
                  6.2 Logical Unit Number 
                    The logical unit number is an 64-bit integer. This type does not 
                    exist in SMI and therefore, we need to define it as a textual 
                    convention for this MIB. 
                   
                  7.  Abbreviations 
                  This MIB will use the following abbreviations: 
                  Inst = Instance 
                  Dev = Device 
                  Tgt = Target 
                  Intr = Initiator 
                  Att = Attached 
                  Id = Identifier 
                  Ident = Identifier 
                  Idx = Index 
                  Prt = Port 
                  Txp = Transport 
                   
                   
                  8.  Warning 
                  This paragraph will be removed in the final draft. 
                  The following topics were not covered in the MIB yet: 
                    * Conformance Statement 
                    * Statistics

                  SCSI MIB                                  January 2002 
                
                 There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have       
                 a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects 
                 may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
                 environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
                 environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
                 network operations. 
                   
                 Some managed objects in this MIB may contain sensitive information. 
                   
                 SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
                 itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
                 control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
                 GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
                   
                 It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features 
                 as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the 
                 User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based Access 
                 Control Model RFC 2575 [15] are recommended. 
                   
                 It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
                 entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
                 configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
                 (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
                 (change/create/delete) them.
