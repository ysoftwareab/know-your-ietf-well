1. Abstract

   This Internet-draft presents a protocol developed at Adaptec, Inc.
   as part of a proof-of-concept demonstration that Gigabit Ethernet
   can serve as a direct replacement for traditional storage
   interconnects. The draft discusses the scope of problems that the
   protocol addresses, the key design decisions that were made, and
   then documents the protocol details.


2. Introduction

   Historically, storage to computer interconnects have been perceived
   as requiring very different technology from that used in the
   networks which connect computers to each other. But, this perception
   is changing as network technology reaches performance levels
   comparable to that of existing direct attached storage
   interconnects. This document presents a SCSI Encapsulation Protocol
   (SEP) developed as part of a project started a couple of years ago
   at Adaptec to demonstrate how network technology can be used to
   create a high performance storage subsystem. Since this session
   layer protocol runs on a reliable transport protocol such as TCP/IP
   [2][3], it allows internet wide access to storage using the SCSI [4]
   command set. However, Adaptec believes it will be most useful in
   Computer Room and Campus size storage networks using gigabit

   Ethernet as the link layer. The project has demonstrated a storage
   area network prototype achieving wire-speed performance, and its
   protocol is being offered to the Internet community as an example of
   a relatively simple yet effective SCSI encapsulation protocol for
   networks.

   The document will first discuss the scope of this project and the
   requirements imposed on its design. A general architectural overview
   and discussion of design alternatives is supplied in Section 5,
   while Section 6 provides a description of the protocol.

3. Scope

   This project is intended to create a storage architecture which
   spans the range from desktop systems through computer room SANs to
   global storage networks, while utilizing standard network hardware
   as the interconnection fabric. The resulting network must have
   performance comparable to alternative storage network architectures,
   with lower prices and better manageability.

   For the desktop and small server market, the basic requirement is to
   connect local storage class devices to computer systems, especially
   when the devices are housed outside of the main computer case. For
   the large server systems, the requirements of storage subsystem
   sharing and interprocess communication over campus area networks are
   added. The large server system space can include cross country SCSI
   as well. To motivate this broad scope, three possible applications
   domains for IPS will be described.

   3.1. Desktop Connectivity

   Desktop systems can use IPS with Ethernet hubs and switches to allow
   connection to a nearly unlimited number of targets. In addition,
   multiple desktop hosts could use IPS to share peripherals,
   effectively producing a desktop SAN configuration.

   While it will be simplest to have an IPS SAN separate from other
   communications networks, there is a significant appeal to having a
   single, combined function Ethernet connector on the desktop
   computer. For example a desktop system could include a connection to
   an external network. However, there are significant security issues
   with such an approach. One answer could be to add a router /
   firewall to isolate the internal IPS traffic from the external
   network while still letting other communications traffic through,
   while another could be to use IPsec which requires setup and
   management, but allows Internet wide use of IPS.

   3.2. Computer Room Storage

   By far the most important use of IPS will be in computer room and
   campus storage networks. A typical installation would use IPS as the
   Storage Area Network (SAN), connecting individual servers and server
   clusters to pools of shared storage or backup media. For example,

Wilson                      Informational                           2

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000


   several clusters could be connected to a larger backbone network
   which also includes a shared RAID subsystem and a tape backup
   subsystem. Each cluster could be on its own subnet, with its own,
   mostly private, storage. The large RAID box shared by the clusters,
   and the automatic tape backup system would also be on their own
   separate subnets. All of the hosts in each cluster and the tape
   backup subsystem can access all of storage as need through the IP
   router. The backup host would determine which files need to be
   backed up, and could then set up 3rd party copies between the
   storage subsystems and the tape drives to cause the affected files
   to be written to tape.

   3.3. Cross Country

   The computer room / campus SAN can be extended to communicate with
   storage devices housed in a geographically remote site for disaster
   recovery purposes. The remote site would contain disks which
   mirrored critical local site data, or archival storage devices. In
   both cases, most of the IPS traffic would be writes, which can be
   highly pipelined using SCSIÆs overlapped request feature to hide the
   long latencies induced by the long distances involved.

4. Requirements

   The following eight metrics are particularly important to the
   storage subsystem industry:

   1. Low latency. Since applications are often blocked while accessing
      storage, storage subsystems strive to achieve latencies on the
      order of a couple hundred microseconds or less. With disk drive
      access times continuing to shrink, low latencies will become even
      more important. Even today, RAID boxes with large cache memories
      can often respond immediately to storage requests, placing a
      premium on low latency in the storage network.

   2. High Bandwidth. Storage subsystem bandwidth needs are rapidly
      increasing. Storage architectures must meet the current needs, as
      well as have a growth path towards supporting future needs.

   3. Relatively short distances in most cases. Because of the latency
      intolerance of most storage applications, distances between
      storage unit and host computers are typically less than one
      hundred meters. There are applications, such as remote backup
      that demand distances measured in kilometers, so ability to
      efficiently span a wide range of distances is highly desirable.

   4. Data Integrity. For most storage applications, the data must be
      delivered completely and without corruption, though there are a
      few applications where some corruption is tolerable.

   5. Low CPU Utilization. Typical storage systems can offload much of
      the processing, and put read data directly into user buffers,


Wilson                      Informational                           3

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000


      avoiding any data copies. Storage system purchasers expect the
      resulting low level of CPU utilization in any candidate products.

   6. Easy management by system administrators. System administration
      complexity is becoming a major concern with emerging storage
      networks.

   7. Cost competitive with other storage network technologies.  Many
      storage applications are quite cost sensitive. Any alternative
      storage technology will have to have an end user price similar to
      older technologies of similar capabilities.

   8. Needs to support interprocess communication paradigms. A likely
      use for IPS will be in cluster configurations, where supporting
      both storage and IPC will reduce system cabling requirements.

   The need for low latency (#1) is easily met using todayÆs Ethernet
   switches and switching routers. Typical values for latency are 3-20
   microseconds for commercially available Gigabit Ethernet switches.
   Even with several switches and a couple hundred meters of cable, the
   round trip delay will be less than 100 microseconds in the absence
   of congestion. These values are adequate for todayÆs storage
   applications. For longer distances, the speed of light will add
   unavoidable latency, but some applications (e.g. remote mirroring)
   can tolerate it.

   The bandwidth requirements imposed by future disk drives (#2) are
   difficult to predict, since they depend on advances in recording
   density and mechanical speed of the disk drives, as well as the
   access patterns of future applications. However, if historical
   improvement rates are assumed, applications which access data
   sequentially, or in very large random reads, are projected to nearly
   saturate a gigabit interconnect with a single drive by 2005. On the
   other hand, transaction processing applications will still be
   limited by disk access time to about 350 IOPS per drive, or one to
   five megabytes a second depending on request size. Even at five
   megabytes a second, over 20 drives could be supported by a single
   gigabit link. Thus, gigabit links should be adequate for small
   server installations, while large systems will need a mixture of 1
   and 10 gigabit links.

   For large systems with external RAID boxes, the new 10 Gigabit
   Ethernet will be required. For clusters, and also for RAID
   management, some Interprocess communication may be required. Such
   communication doesnÆt require large bandwidths, but does require
   very low latencies (the lower the better) and efficient transport of
   short packets. This argues for a low latency, low overhead transport
   protocol, but also argues for QOS and priority features such as
   found in IP version 6.

   The typical distances encountered  with todayÆs storage systems (#3)
   can be met with 1000 BaseT Ethernet.  In addition, since SEP runs on
   standard networking components, there are no inherent distance

Wilson                      Informational                           4

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000


   limitations, opening up the possibility of direct access to even
   globally distributed storage resources.

   In networks, error free and complete data transfer (#4) is provided
   by transport protocols, in particular by TCP on the internet. The
   TCP also provides an end-to-end checksum to guard against errors
   introduced in transit which have not otherwise been detected, for
   instance in unprotected data paths. For critical data storage, a
   CRC, which would provide better protection, could be added at the
   SEP level (Section 5.5.3).

   In order to equal the low CPU utilization of current host adapters
   (#5), the whole network stack will have to run on the IPS host
   adapter, ideally with special purpose hardware. To keep the hardware
   from becoming too complicated and expensive, a simple SCSI
   encapsulation protocol is required, such as described in this
   document.

   The manageability (#6) issue consists of several parts. One aspect
   of this is the ability to do hot insertion and removal, with
   automatic discovery of the insertion or removal. Ethernet provides
   the hot insertion and removal portion, but additional technology
   must be supplied for automatic discovery. Existing discovery
   protocols, such as the Service Locator Protocol(SLP)[5] proposed for
   use on the Internet or other SAN management protocols may suffice.
   Interfacing to existing storage management systems would also
   provide storage partitioning, external RAID management, and other
   services.

   Another aspect of manageability is the use of the Internet Protocol
   (IP). By including IP, an Ethernet based storage network can take
   advantage of a wide variety of network management software already
   developed for corporate Intranets. The IP layer also provides QoS
   and bandwidth management options, important to configuring an
   efficient storage network.

   Something like 80% of the storage market consists of small to medium
   size systems, where cost is a major issue. To be accepted in this
   market, a new storage network must have price points comparable to
   the existing storage solutions, parallel SCSI and Fibre Channel, as
   indicated by requirement 7. The use of off-the-shelf Ethernet
   components will help, but low cost, full bandwidth single chip
   implementations of host adapters and target controllers must be
   possible.

   Currently many generic cluster systems (those that donÆt rely on
   System Area Networks, which are mostly proprietary), use TCP/IP for
   their Interprocess Communication Traffic (IPC). Because a network
   based storage protocol can co-exist with other network traffic, the
   current TCP/IP based IPC could simply share the storage network with
   storage traffic, providing an easy way to meet requirement #8.

5. SEP Architecture

   The SEP architecture is designed to address the requirements of
   desktop, small server, campus wide and larger storage area networks.
   Since the most likely uses will be in the server and campus SAN
   environment, the architecture is focussed on providing a cost and
   performance competitive solution in those spaces.

   With typical server applications, CPU utilization by the host
   processors is a particularly big concern. In order to keep host CPU
   utilization at the same low level achieved by traditional storage
   adapters, the entire stack, from SEP on down must be processed on
   the host adapter. Partly this is because the most common network,
   Ethernet, has a maximum frame size of 1500 bytes, with header
   processing required for each frame. Since most storage transfers are
   for larger amounts of data, they must be broken into multiple 1500
   byte frames, suffering processing overhead on each frame which would
   be absent from other storage interconnects. But the biggest
   contributor to CPU utilization is the network buffer to user buffer
   copy required on storage read operations. Since the ultimate
   location of the received data is not known until the packet headers
   have been processed, the normal approach of a simple NIC combined
   with main CPU header processing, cannot place the data directly into
   the user buffer, but must copy it there using the main CPU. This
   typically requires two to three times the CPU cycles of the header
   processing.

   While protocol processing can be done by a microprocessor on the
   host adapter, the best cost/performance will be achieved with ASIC
   based processing. To facilitate ASIC implementation, the SEP
   protocol has been kept as simple as possible, consistent with the
   twin goals of good performance and reliable delivery.

   Using Ethernet also keeps costs low, as it is the most widely
   deployed LAN technology and Ethernet components enjoy cost benefits
   that come with high volume. In the long run, IPS should cost less
   than current storage subsystems whose components are only
   manufactured for their specific storage technologies. There are also
   cost benefits from being able to share infrastructure with the
   traditional networking services, or at least using the same type of
   equipment and network management utilities in a separately
   configured storage infrastructure.

   This section will discuss a number of architectural aspects of SEP,
   including the general approach and several key issues. Some of the
   reasons for selecting particular mechanisms will be included.
   Section 6 will specify the actual protocol used in AdaptecÆs
   studies.

   5.1. Encapsulation Approach

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000


   In order to make maximum use of existing network technology, SEP
   operates at the session layer of the network protocol stack, just
   above the TCP/IP layer, as shown in Figure 1. It relies on the
   transport layer for correct delivery, and concentrates on
   multiplexing SCSI command, data and status information. Because
   TCP/IP can be used on any Link and Physical layer, IPS implemented
   with SEP can provide SCSI service over any network which has
   adequate performance.

   SCSI identifies the type of information (phase) on the data lines
   with a set of encoded control lines. For a serial approach, it is
   much more efficient to send a type code at the beginning of the new
   phase, which applies till the next phase. This type code is part of
   a header that is appended to the beginning of data from each phase.
   This header also contains the SCSI tag, so that data and status
   segments can be matched to the correct command.

   Transport protocols such as TCP provide a stream of bytes arriving
   in the same order as they were sent. Interpretation of those bytes
   is left up to the higher layer, such as SEP. Thus, the headers need
   to be identifiable by SEP using information within the data stream.
   A count of bytes till the next header will be placed in the current
   header, and SEP will use this byte count to determine the location
   of the next header.

   The byte count method is used because it is fairly simple to
   implement, efficient, and completely self-contained. However, there
   may be cases where you want the transport layer to identify the
   location of an SEP header, in which case the urgent pointer in TCP
   will be used to indicate when an SEP header is the first item in a
   transport packet. An implementation must be able to force all SEP
   headers to be at the beginning of a transport packet if either
   initiator or target insist, and should indicate when a header
   happens to be at the beginning of a transport packet in any case. To
   make extracting a SEP header more efficient, it will always be
   placed on a four byte boundary, by the method described in Section
   6.1.2.

   5.2. Connection Endpoints

   As discussed in Section 4, data must be delivered completely and
   without corruption. This means that the underlying network must
   deliver data bytes in original transmission order to the SCSI layer,
   and must have facilities to detect and recover from lost or damaged
   bytes. There is one additional requirement imposed by the SCSI
   architecture, and that is that all commands heading to a logical
   unit arrive in transmission order.

   The InternetÆs TCP accomplishes this reliable delivery of data by
   establishing a logical connection between two endpoints (often
   called a session) which allows it to track the progress of data
   transfer through a set of state variables. Each transport level
   session can be thought of as a pipe, which passes bytes from one
   endpoint to another. The TCP will allow multiple instances to exist,
   providing independent pipes between a variety of endpoints. To send
   a SEP command or data segment from one endpoint to another simply
   requires specifying the appropriate pipe.

   The simple addressing and flow control provided by a transport
   protocol for each of its instances would argue for a separate
   instance for each SCSI command. However, aside from the overhead
   required to establish and terminate an instance of a transport
   protocol, there is also the requirement for ordering between
   commands to the same logical unit. But, because the pipes are
   independent, there is no ordering relationship enforced between
   pipes and hence between commands. So, when multiple commands can be
   sent to one LUN (i.e. tagged command queuing), all the commands must
   flow over the same transport protocol instance. SEP includes
   multiplexing features to accomplish this.

   When using LUN bridges, a single pipe could be used to send all data
   and commands to all targets and LUNs behind the bridge. However, LUN
   information would have to be added to all SCSI command and data
   segments, and flow control and buffer management would be more
   difficult. For this reason, an architecture that attaches one
   transport protocol instance to each LUN will be developed. For
   devices that present only one LUN, a single protocol instance will
   suffice.

   For continuously active devices, such as disk drives, the instance
   will be created shortly after the devices have been identified and
   will remain until LUN removal or system shutdown. Other devices,
   such as a shared printer, may require that an initiator connect to
   it with a session only when it has data to print. Such a session
   will then be terminated after successful printing, freeing up
   limited session resources for use in accepting sessions from other
   initiators.

   Figure 2 shows the set of transport instances which could exist in a
   two host, six disk system. Note that two of the disks are parallel

   SCSI and connected to a RAID box, two more are parallel SCSI and
   connected through a LUN bridge and the last two are IPS disks. Both
   hosts share the RAID box, each with a single transport session to
   the RAID controllerÆs single logical disk drive. The LUN bridge gets
   two, one for each SCSI disk attached to it.

   5.3. SEP Functions

   The Storage Encapsulation Protocol (SEP) is basically a method for
   including phase and tag information with the data stream. This is a
   session layer protocol which rides on the TCP transport layer. The
   Storage Encapsulation Protocol performs the following three
   functions:

   1. Identifying the command, data, status and message information
      segments.

   2. Associating commands with their data and status

   3. Providing flow control between host data buffers and target data
      buffers.

   The first function implies appending a header with a type field to
   the data associated with each phase. The method used to identify
   those headers will be covered in Section 6.1.1. With SEP many of the
   messages used by parallel SCSI will not be necessary because their
   purposes are accomplished directly by SEP headers or are not
   applicable to a network based approach. However, a message type is
   included to handle the few which remain, as specified in Section
   6.2.4.

   The second function, association of commands with data and status is
   necessary for devices that can queue up several commands, such as
   disk drives. The SCSI approach of adding a small tag to commands,


Wilson                      Informational                           9

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000


   data and status is used in SEP, where the tags are in a field of the
   SEP header.

   SCSI disk drives are capable of queuing multiple commands, allowing
   them to process the commands in the most efficient order.
   Unfortunately, disk drives tend to have a limited amount of data
   buffering memory, which can be overwhelmed by the data associated
   with queued write commands. Parallel SCSI will disconnect when this
   happens and request a write commandÆs data only when it is
   processing that particular write command. An encapsulation protocol
   which just sends write data immediately after a write command and
   relies on the transport or link layer protocol to prevent data
   buffer overrun, will block future commands and write data from
   reaching the drive, even though it might be more efficient for the
   drive to process them first. This is why SEP provides session layer
   flow control as its third function. Section 5.4 explores approaches
   to such flow control. The method actually used by SEP to provide
   data buffer flow control, which allows the drives to ask for write
   data just before they need will be described in Section 5.4.

   5.4. Target Buffer Management

   In traditional storage systems, hosts pre-allocate buffer space and
   hence initiators have no buffer management issues, but targets have
   limited space and need some form of high level flow control to
   prevent buffer overruns. The high level flow control implemented by
   SEP is called Get SCSI Data and allows the target to request
   discrete amounts of data from the host adapter (or stop a stream of
   data that is already being sent). The command is implemented
   symmetrically, so a host adapter can use it to meter a stream of
   data as well, should that become necessary.

   In the normal storage model, initiators are installed in hosts, with
   large amounts of memory. The hosts know how much buffer space will
   be needed by each command and can (and usually do) pre-allocate the
   space. Thus, Initiators can guarantee to source and sink all the
   data required by outstanding commands.  However, targets often have
   very small buffers, and though the storage media will eventually be
   able to accept all of the write data being sent to it, there is not
   enough buffer space to store the data until the media is able to
   accept it. The transport protocol could be relied upon to prevent
   overflow of the buffers, however this stops all information from
   reaching the target, which can create problems, especially in a
   target that supports tag queuing.

   This problem is not unique to SEP, but exists with SCSI over Fibre
   Channel (FCP) and parallel SCSI. Both Fibre Channel and parallel
   SCSI have transport level flow control (RREADY in Fibre Channel and
   REQ/ACK in parallel SCSI). In addition, Fibre Channel uses
   FCP_XFER_READY commands to provide Host Buffer to Target Buffer flow
   control while Parallel SCSI uses disconnects for that purpose, in
   addition to their use in enabling SCSI bus multiplexing. That is, in
   parallel SCSI, if a Target is operating in Write Cache Enabled mode,

   and its Cache fills up with write data, it will simply disconnect
   until it again has space in its write cache.

   In an IPS system the initiator may want to send many commands to the
   target, with the intent that the target will order them so as to
   maximize the transfer rate to the media. Thus, the commands will not
   be executed in the same order as they are sent. If many of them are
   writes, and the initiator sends the data along with the write
   command, the targetÆs buffer could fill up. The transportÆs packet
   buffers would then fill up and it would stop receiving any
   additional commands and data from the host, until some of the
   already received data for already received write commands was
   written to the media.

   What all of this means is that we need a mechanism to allow the
   target to separately manage its data buffer resources, instead of
   using the transport layer flow control for that purpose. Two
   possible approaches will be discussed and then compared.

   The safest approach is for the target to be in complete control of
   write data transfers. In parallel SCSI this is achieved by allowing
   the target to disconnect from the initiator whenever it is offered
   more write data than it can handle. In Fiber Channel, a solicited
   information unit request is used to request write data from the
   initiator. The P1394 architecture goes even further, putting the
   target in complete control of the data transfers by passing it a
   scatter/gather list and requiring it to fetch write data through
   physical read commands to the host system memory. For SEP, we
   propose to implement a version of the Fiber Channel model for target
   controlled write data transfer which will be called the SCSI Data
   Request.

   If an IPS target has a lot of buffer memory, it may want to decrease
   initial latency and improve cable bit efficiency by sending some or
   all of the write data along with the write command. If the target
   later discovered that it was running out of buffer space it could
   send the equivalent of an XOFF command to the Initiator. When buffer
   space again permitted, it would send an XON to re-start the flow of
   write data.

   The same SCSI Data Request command can be used for the XOFF and XON
   functions. To stop the flow, the target would send a SCSI Data
   Request command with the byte offset pointing to the last byte it
   will be able to accept. The initiator will attempt to stop sending
   at the specified byte offset, though it may be unable to because
   further data has already been committed to the transport layer for
   sending. If it is not able to stop at the specified byte offset, it
   will stop as soon as possible, and reset its internal byte pointer
   to the stop value, from where it will continue sending when asked to
   resume transmissions by a future SCSI Data Request (acting as an
   XON). This last feature will let it reset its scatter/gather list
   pointers, a potentially time consuming task, before receiving the
   XON.

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000



   To restart transmissions, a SCSI Data Request command with the byte
   offset pointing to the last byte the receiver is now able to accept,
   which presumably is further along in the stream than were the stream
   was previously stopped will be sent by the target. If the amount is
   more than is left to send, the transmission will stop when all data
   requested by the original write command has been sent. The target
   could set the stop point according to the size of its available data
   buffers, and effectively transition to the safe mode, or it could
   specify a larger stop point and use an XOFF later on if necessary.

   The conservative approach of requesting each chunk of write data
   from the host is probably best suited to targets with relatively
   small buffers, such as disk drives. If write caching is enabled, the
   disk could still ask for all the write data as soon as it determined
   that it had adequate space, overlapping the fetch of the write data
   with other operations, such as seeking. For devices with large
   buffers, such as RAID boxes, the more aggressive approach of sending
   the write data with the command would probably work best. If the
   RAID box becomes overwhelmed, it can still cut off the transfer with
   the SCSI Data Request command.

   5.5. Other Issues

   5.5.1. SCSI Messages

   For the most part SCSI messages are not needed, either because the
   information they contain is built into the SEP header or because
   they are not applicable to a serial interconnect. However a message
   system is still provided for the few messages that might need to be
   transported between the host and the target. The SCSI messages which
   are useful to send are the Abort, Abort Tag, Bus Device Reset,
   Initiate Recovery, Message Reject, Release Recovery, and Terminate
   I/O process. These messages are encapsulated in a message type SEP
   segment, and as such can be up to 64KB long. Because of this
   extended length option, other uses for the message system may be
   developed in the future.

   5.5.2. Third Party Commands

   The SCSI-3 specification allows a number of third party commands,
   such as copy. These commands are sent from an initiator to a target,
   and cause the target to perform some operation with another target.
   With SEP, the initiator will first open a session with one of the
   targets, then instruct the target to open a session with the other
   target through a special SEP command. Finally the third party
   operations will be sent to the first target, which will use the
   session it has established with the second target to actually
   perform the commands.

   5.5.3. Segment CRC

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000


   While many link level protocols include a CRC with each packet,
   intermediate routers and switches may not have full error checking
   on their data paths, leading to the possibility of undetected data
   corruption. The TCP includes a sixteen bit checksum in its header to
   detect such corruption, but checksums are not as strong a detection
   mechanism as CRCs. To protect critical data, an optional segment CRC
   is defined, which appends a four byte CRC onto every SEP segment.
   This CRC covers the SEP header as well as the associated data.

6. SEP Details

   6.1. SEP fundamentals

   Command, status, message and data information is encapsulated as SEP
   segments with an SEP header at the beginning. The SEP header is a
   fixed length of eight bytes, as defined in this section. The
   information included with individual segment SEP types will be shown
   in Section 6.2.

   Figure 3 shows the SEP header.

   Flags: These are the SCSI encapsulation flags. Two flags are
   currently defined across multiple segment types:

   0x80  Command Complete û no more data to be sent in this direction.

   0x40  Good Status û status is good, so status segment wonÆt be sent.

   The range of 0x01 to 0x08 are reserved for segment type specific
   information.

   Flag usage will be further defined with each type for which they are
   valid.

   Tag: The same tag used in Parallel SCSI to associate data, messages
   and status with commands. Always contains valid information, even if
   only one outstanding command is allowed for this session.

   SEP Segment Length:  The length in bytes of actual data in the
   segment. Additional pad bytes may be inserted between the end of the
   data and the next header, as discussed in Section 6.1.2, and a
   trailing CRC may also be inserted, as discussed in Section 5.5.3.
   Since all headers will have at least one byte of  ôdataö, a zero in
   the length field will mean 65536. When transferring more than 65536
   bytes, additional data headers will be required, however it is
   recommended that headers be spaced closer together, so that new
   commands can be sent to the target in a timely fashion.

   6.1.2. Padding to four byte boundaries

   Hardware implementation of a protocol such as SEP can be greatly
   simplified if all fields are aligned on four byte or larger
   boundaries. Since simplified hardware results in cheaper and faster
   implementations, SEP preserves a four byte alignment. To make sure
   that all SEP headers and segments start on four byte boundaries, the
   payload in an SEP segment will be padded with zeros to the next byte
   boundary that is divisible by 4. The Next SCSI Header field will
   indicate the actual number of valid bytes, and the additional
   padding will be automatically applied and removed by SEP. An example
   of how a 6 byte CDB would be handled is shown in Figure 4.

   6.1.3. SEP CRC

   If the optional SEP CRC is used, it is appended to the end of a
   segment, after any required pad bytes, as shown in . The length
   field in the header still refers to the amount of usable data in the
   segment, so the CRC constitutes an additional four bytes which must
   be added to the overall length till next header by the receiving
   SEP.

   Figure 6: SCSI Data Segment

   The SCSI Data segment (type: 0x04) will contain up to 65536 bytes of
   data, as shown in Figure 6. If the Command Complete flag is set, it
   indicates that this is the last Data segment in this direction. If
   Good Status is set on a read segment, it indicates that good status
   was received, and no status segment will follow. The following flags
   are valid:

   0x80  Command Complete - Placed in the last SEP header of a data
         segment to indicate that this segment is the last one in this
         direction for this command. On a command which transfers data
         from an initiator to a target, the target can determine if an
         over- or under-run condition has occurred by comparing the
         actual amount transferred with the expected amount. If placed
         in a segment carrying data or status from a target to an
         initiator, it also indicates the SCSI command has completed.

   0x40  Good Status û Placed in the last SEP header of read data
         (along with Command Complete) to indicate that good status was
         received. No status segment will follow.

   Figure 9: SCSI Data Request

   The SCSI Data Request segment (Figure 9, Type: 0xC) allows a device
   receiving data (usually a target) to control the time at which the
   data is delivered. The typical case occurs when write data is being
   sent to a target with inadequate buffer memory, where the device
   wants little or no data sent to it until it is ready to actually
   transfer the data to the media. The SCSI Data Request allows it to
   ask for appropriate size chunks of data at a more convenient time,
   rather than when the host adapter wants to send it.

   The SCSI Data Request sets a new value into a stop pointer, which is
   a byte offset from the beginning of the data stream for this
   command. Both the sending and receiving SEP layer will keep a
   current byte pointer indicating which byte they last sent or
   received. When the sending SEP layer receives a SCSI Data Request,
   it immediately updates its Stop Pointer, and checks to see whether

                The SCSI Encapsulation Protocol (SEP)        MAY 2000


   the current byte pointer is greater or less than the new Stop
   Pointer. If the current pointer is greater, it immediately stops
   sending data, and sets its current byte pointer back to the new
   value of the stop pointer. If the current pointer is less, it
   continues sending until the current pointer equals the stop pointer.
   If the SEP layer has stopped sending data because its data pointer
   was equal to the stop pointer, it will resume sending data from its
   current data pointer and continue up to the new stop pointer.
   Thus, the SCSI Data Request can be used to regulate host buffer to
   target buffer data flow in three ways: by not allowing the host to
   send write data until explicitly requested by the target, by
   allowing the host to send some initial  write data then explicitly
   requesting the rest by the target, or by allowing the host to send
   write data immediately after the write command until stopped by the
   target. In the first and second approaches the SCSI Data Request is
   being used as an explicit data fetch mechanism, while in the third
   approach it is being used as an XOFF / XON signal.

   In the explicit fetch method the target will determine how much data
   it can initially accept and negotiate that amount, which may be
   zero, with the initiator. When the target is ready to receive the
   rest of the data, it will send a SCSI Data Request with a stop value
   equal to the number of bytes it can next accept.  As additional data
   buffers become available, the target can increase the stop pointer
   by the amount of the additional buffers, by sending additional SCSI
   Data Requests with the new stop value. The SCSI Data Request acts
   immediately to increase the stop pointer, allowing transmission to
   continue uninterrupted.

   In the XOFF / XON approach, the target will normally be able to
   store all the delivered data, but if it should run out of buffer
   space, it will stop the delivery by sending a SCSI Data Request with
   a stop point set to the offset of the last byte it can accept. Any
   additional data received will be discarded. The target will later
   re-enable data flow by sending a SCSI Data Request with a higher
   stop point.

   The SCSI Set Data Pointer (Figure 10, Type: 0xDS) allows devices and
   LUN bridges to emulate the Modify Data Pointers, Save Data Pointers,
   and Restore Data Pointers messages from Parallel SCSI in the host
   adapter to target direction. Because network communications tend to
   be highly pipelined, the targetÆs byte count and the host adapterÆs
   will normally not be in synch, so a direct offset from the beginning
   of the commandÆs data stream will be used. A bridge can properly
   emulate the effect of Data pointer messages from SCSI targets by
   keeping local count of their progress through the data stream. This
   command will immediately update the senderÆs Data Pointer, so it
   should not be notified by the receiver until all desired data has
   been received from the last SCSI Data Request.

   The SCSI Set Data Pointer is also used to separate streams of SCSI
   data when there is a non-sequential point in the data flow. For
   example, if SCSI Data Request is used to stop data flow, and data
   beyond the stop point had already been sent, the sender will precede
   the next chunk of requested data with a SCSI Set Data Pointer since
   the new chunk will be for earlier bytes in the stream. The receiver
   will discard the extra data over the requested stop point until it
   receives the  SCSI Set Data Pointer which matches the previous stop
   point. Because SCSI only transfers data in one direction at a time
   per command, there is no ambiguity in the two uses of SCSI Set Data
   Pointer.

   The Connect & Negotiate SEP header is followed by a 16 byte SEP
   segment which specifies a LUN and Desired SEP level parameters for
   this session, as shown in Figure 11. This Information must be sent
   by an initiator at the beginning of a SEP session before any SCSI
   transfers are attempted. Attempts to send SCSI commands before the
   Connect and Negotiate command has been successfully acknowledged
   will fail. The Parameter values field (Figure 12 )is used to
   indicate SEP options which the Initiator would like to have enabled.
