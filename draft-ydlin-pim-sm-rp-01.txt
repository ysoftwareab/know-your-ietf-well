Abstract

   The Protocol Independent Multicast-Sparse Mode (PIM-SM) protocol
   establishes core-base tree to forward multicast datagrams in a
   network.  In PIM-SM, the core or Rendezvous Point (RP) of a group is
   determined at each multicast router by hashing a group address, i.e.,
   a class-D IP address, to one of the candidate RPs.  The hash function
   is characterized by its ability to evenly and uniquely choose the
   core for a group and remains insensitive to the geographic
   distribution of the group members and the sources.  However, it may
   result in a multicast tree with high cost.

   This draft presents a relocation mechanism which is extension to PIM-

   SM, in which RP could be relocated periodically.  When a new RP is
   found, the original RP informs all members to re-join to the new RP.

1. Introduction

   Multicast routing protocols can be categorized as source-based tree
   and shared-tree protocols.  A source-based tree protocol builds
   separate trees for each (source, group) pair, that is, each source
   has its own tree that reaches the active group members, such as DVMRP
   [1], PIM-DM [2], and MOSPF [3].  On the other hand, shared-based
   protocols such as PIM-SM [4] and CBT [5] build distributed trees
   having a central point (or core) to whom all receivers attached.
   Typically, a source sends datagrams to the RP and RP forwards them to
   all members through the RP-based multicast tree.  Therefore, a
   shared-tree router only needs to maintain state information for each
   group instead of for each (source, group) pair.

   In PIM-SM, new members wanting to join a group send Join messages to
   a core, called Rendezvous Point (RP), of the distribution tree.  The
   RP administers the specific multicast group(s), and facilitates the
   joining/leaving of the group members.  The address of the RP is
   determined at each multicast router by mapping a group to one of the
   candidate RPs with a hash function.  However, the chosen RP may be
   inappropriate for its group, for example, causes more tree cost.  The
   hash function is characterized by its ability to evenly and uniquely
   choose a candidate RP to be a core in order to balance the service
   load of each candidate RP in the network.

   This draft proposes an RP relocation mechanism which is extension to
   the PIM-SM multicast routing protocol.  The hash function of PIM-SM
   is initially used to obtain an RP for the multicast group.  As the
   sources come and go, RP relocates its location periodically
   afterward.  An attempt is made to obtain an appropriate core location
   by using an estimated tree cost function to evaluate the
   appropriateness of the candidates.  When RP relocation is determined,
   the original RP multicasts NEW_RP message to all members to inform
   them to re-join to the new RP.  Consequently, a new distribution tree
   is built with the least cost.

2. Issues and Motivations

   PIM-SM is a commonly used multicast routing protocol that provides
   efficient communication for multicast groups with sparsely
   distributed members.  The designers observed that several hosts
   wanting to participate in a multicast conference do not justify
   having their group's multicast traffic periodically broadcast across
   the entire network.  To eliminate the scaling problem, PIM-SM is
   designed to limit multicast traffic so that only routers interested

   in receiving traffic for a particular group will receive it.  By
   unicast routing, the source router knows how to reach and forward the
   traffic to the RP.  Then, RP distributes the traffic to all the
   members through the RP-based multicast tree.

   In order to broadcast the set of candidate RPs to the network nodes,
   the bootstrap router (BSR) is elected for the domain.  BSR originates
   Bootstrap messages to distribute the set of RPs information, which
   are distributed hop-by-hop throughout the domain.  There is only one
   RP-set per PIM-SM domain.  By using a hash function, say Hash(), each
   router can uniquely map a group address G to one of the routers in
   the RP-set.  That is, candidate C_k is chosen as RP if C_k yields
   highest hash value Hash(G, M, C_i), for all C_i belong to the RPset.
   The hash mark, M, allows a number of consecutive groups to resolve to
   the same RP.

   The shared tree, although provides better scalability, does not
   optimize the delivery path through the network.  RP for the group is
   typically designed without respect to its location.  Thus, an RP
   could be located for away from all group members, resulting in
   inefficient transmission.

   Steiner tree [6] is a well-known example of finding a minimum
   multicast tree.  However, the multicast tree T(S, R) in PIM-SM, the
   set of sources, S, and the set of members, R, are dynamic changed.
   That is, after sources and/or receivers come and go, the least cost
   multicast tree is different.  Therefore, considering a single group
   in which no member switches over to the shortest path tree (SPT),
   there is a sequence of least cost multicast trees, {T0, T1, T2, ...
   }, where Ti=Tree(S ->RPi) U Tree(RPi -> R).  Since the tree Ti is
   rooted at the RPi the problem of finding the sequence {Ti} is reduced
   to the problem of finding the sequence {RPi}, where the RP0 is the
   initial hash RP.

   Therefore, in this study, assume RP_i is the current RP of G, we
   propose an RP relocation mechanism which relocates RP when the tree
   cost reduction, TC(RP_i) - TC(RP_{i+1}), if it is larger than a pre-
   defined threshold, q.  In addition, three control messages are needed
   to migrate to the new RP and reliably maintain the membership of the
   group.  For convenience of our description, Table 1 summarizes the
   symbols used in this draft.

3. RP Relocation Algorithm

   Of priority concern in a distribution tree, the lower the tree costs
   of hop count and delay implies better routing paths.  Tree cost is
   defined as the sum of the costs of all links of the multicast tree.
   Our mechanism attempts to reduce the tree cost by relocating the RP
   for a multicast group.  To map an appropriate RP in a group, %this
   study uses an estimated function can be used.  For example, computing
   by equations in [7] we can obtain a RP with the nearly minimum tree
   cost from the RPset of a group.  Equation (3) calculates the
   distribution tree cost if the candidate C_i is taken as the RP,
   TC(C_i), by taking the average of Eq.  (1) and (2), i.e., the maximum
   and minimum bounds on tree cost.  These equations use the distance
   (i.e.  cost:E -> R+) for each possible destination as the metric.
   Notably, the distance information is already available to routers.

         TCmin(C_i)= min. tree cost                       (1)

         TCmax(C_i)= max. tree cost                       (2)

         TC(C_i)   =[ TCmin(C_i)+ TCmax(C_i) ]/2          (3)

   The best-case tree is linear if a lower bound on the cost, TCmin, of
   a tree rooted at some node is obtained.  The cost of the tree is
   simply the maximum distance from RP to any sender.  When using hop
   count (i.e.  cost:E -> 1) as the metric, the function can obtain a
   tighter bound by adding the number of senders that are at an equal
   distance.  This bound is owing to that the distribution tree cannot
   be completely linear, but must have at least an additional link.

   Opposite to the lower bound of the cost, the upper bound on the cost,
   TCmax, of a tree rooted at some node is that no links are shared
   among the paths to each sender.  Therefore, the maximum tree cost is
   the sum of the sender distances.  Also, if the number of group
   senders is greater than the root degree, the bound is tightened by
   subtracting the difference to calculate the cost for the sharing
   links.  The estimation function is thus defined as the average of the
   sum of the minimum cost and maximum cost.

   As shown in the algorithm of Fig.1, a new member m that joins a group
   sends a Join message to the hashed RP.  The hashRP verifies whether
   the RP of this group has been migrated (i.e.  the rFlag is true).  If
   so, hashRP redirects m to the new RP by sending the NEW_RP message.
   Thus, m sends a Join message and established (*, G) state along the
   path towards the new RP.  In addition, m sends a Prune message to the

   hashRP to discard the previous path.  The currentRP also confirms
   whether if the relocation timer tr has expired and the set of sources
   of the group has been changed.  If it has, a new RP with significant
   cost reduction is computed by the above cost functions TC for each
   candidate RP.

   Once the RP with least cost for a group is found, the function
   ChangeRP is invoked, as shown in Fig.2.  The currentRP first checks
   whether the new RP is the hashRP.  If it is, the rFlag is reset to

   false since the currentRP returns back to the original hashed RP.  To
   migrate the distribution tree, message NEW_RP is advertised by the
   currentRP to inform the newRP, hashRP, sources, and all members of
   the group.

   For keeping this relocation state, each node with (*, G) state
   maintains a relocation table to record the state of RP relocation, as
   well as the addresses of the RP and old RP, as shown in Table 2, G.RP
   and G.oldRP, respectively.  The rFlag indicates whether if RP of this
   group has been relocated, i.e., not the original hashed RP.  When a
   new RP is obtained, the current RP becomes the oldRP and its address
   is moved to the G.oldRP; the new RP address is then saved at the
   G.RP.  Notably, the corresponding incoming interface (iif) and the
   Reverse Path Forwarding (RPF) neighbor (nbrRPF) of the
   G.newRP/G.oldRP are also saved.  State information of the relocating
   process prevents the chaos caused by RPF checking during the
   transition between the two consecutive multicast trees.

   For example, a node with (*, G1) state continues to receive and
   distribute packets from the old RP (RP1') at the interface i_1',
   until this node receives packets from the new RP (RP1) at the
   interface i_1.  Furthermore, in order to migrate the distribution
   tree of the group G1, the current RP (RP1') of G1 multicasts the
   encoded NEW_RP message towards the newRP, all sources (First-hop
   routers) and members (Last-hop routers) of group G1.  This message
   redirects all sources to re-register, all members to re-join to the
   new RP.  Note that in case of Gn, since the rFlag is false, this
   entry records hashRP of Gn at the G.RP field.

   Figure 3 shows the RP state transition of a specific group G.  At the
   system start up, the RP is in the $Hashing$ state and enters the
   $Selection$ state as timer tr expires.  If the selected candidate
   (C_k) can significantly reduce the current tree cost, migration of RP
   tree is invoked and the $Transition$ state is entered, and thereafter
   transits further to the $Relocation$ state or $Hashing$ state,
   depending on whether the newly selected RP is the original hashed RP.
   Returning back to the $Hashing$ state means that the original hashed
   RP turns out to be the best RP for G again.  On the other hand, if
   the reduction in tree cost does not exceed the threshold, q, the RP
   enters the $Relocation$ state or $Hashing$ state, depending on the
   value of rFlag where true means this RP is a relocated, instead of
   hashed, one.  Note that the RPIM-SM verifies the source list, S, and
   the tree cost of G every tr time unless the system re-startup.

   This message is sent toward the RP or a source periodically, to
   create or refresh a branch of a multicast distribution tree.

4.1.1 At the hashRP

           if (G.rFlag == true) then
               send NEW_RP(G.RP) to receiving router
           else

4.2 Receiving Prune Messages

   This message is sent toward a source by a router when it wish to
   leave the multicast group.  This message is also sent toward the RP
   when a router switches from the RP tree to the source-rooted shortest
   path tree.  RPIM-SM handles this message as in PIM-SM.

4.3 Receiving NEW_RP Messages

   This message is used to advertise to the group that who is the new RP
   from now on.  When the computation of tree cost in Fig.  1 is done
   and the decision of the RP relocation is positive, the current RP
   sends the message NEW_RP (G, newRP) to the newRP, hashRP, sources,
   and multicasts it to all members of the group.  Then, the migration
   process is triggered, i.e., the sources re-register to the newRP and
   members re-join to the newRP.

5. Summary

   This draft proposes a dynamic mechanism, RPIM-SM, which is an
   extension to the PIM-SM multicast routing protocol.  The original
   hashed Rendezvous Point (RP) location may be inappropriate for the
   group.  Therefore, according to an estimated tree cost, the PIM-SM is
   extended by relocating the RP periodically.  In addition, the
   candidate RP with minimum tree cost is selected to be the new RP of
   the group.  To migrate to the new RP, a additional message, NEW_RP,
   is needed to notify sources to re-register, and members to re-join
   the new RP.

6. Security Considerations

   In addition to PIM-SM, the control messages, NEW_RP, I_AM_RP and
   RP_CONFIRM may use IPsec to address security concerns.
