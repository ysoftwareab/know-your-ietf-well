Abstract

   The offer/answer model for SDP assumes that endpoints establish
   somehow the QoS required for the media streams they establish.
   Endpoints in closed environments typically agree out of band (e.g.,
   using configuration information) which QoS mechanism to use.
   However, on the Internet, there is more than one QoS service
   available.  Consequently, there is a need for a mechanism to
   negotiate which QoS mechanism to use for a particular media stream.
   This document defines such a mechanism.

Internet-Draft       QoS Mechanism Selection in SDP         October 2008


1.  Introduction

   The offer/answer model [RFC3264] for SDP [RFC4566] does not provide
   any mechanism for endpoints to negotiate the QoS mechanism to be used
   for a particular media stream.  Even when QoS preconditions [RFC3312]
   are used, the choice of the QoS mechanism is left unspecified, up to
   the endpoints.

   Endpoints that support more than one QoS mechanism need a way to
   negotiate which one to use for a particular media stream.  Examples
   of QoS mechanisms are RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol) [RFC2205]
   and NSIS (Next Steps in Signaling) [RFC4080].

   This document defines a mechanism that allows endpoints to negotiate
   the QoS mechanism to be used for a particular media stream.
   Section 3 defines the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv' SDP
   attributes.  Section 4 specifies the use of these new SDP attributes
   with the offer/answer model.  Section 5 provides an example of an
   offer/answer exchanges that uses these attributes.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  SDP Attributes Definition

   This document defines the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv' session
   and media-level SDP [RFC4566] attributes.  The following is their
   augmented Backus-Naur Form (BNF) [RFC5234] syntax, which is based on
   the SDP [RFC4566] grammar:

   attribute              = qos-mech-send-attr
   attribute              = qos-mech-recv-attr

   qos-mech-send-attr     = "qos-mech-send" ":" *(SP qos-mech)
   qos-mech-recv-attr     = "qos-mech-recv" ":" *(SP qos-mech)

   qos-mech               = rsvp / nsis / extension-mech
   extension-mech         = token

   The 'qos-mech' token identifies a QoS mechanism that is supported by
   the entity generating the session description.  A token that appears
   in a 'qos-mech-send' attribute identifies a QoS mechanism that can be
   used to reserve resources for traffic sent by the entity generating

   the session description.  A token that appears in a 'qos-mech-recv'
   attribute identifies a QoS mechanism that can be used to reserve
   resources for traffic received by the entity generating the session
   description.

   The 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv' attributes are not
   interdependent; one can be used without the other.

   The following is an example of an 'm' line with a 'qos-mech-send' and
   a 'qos-mech-recv' attributes:

     m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 0
     a=qos-mech-send:rsvp nsis
     a=qos-mech-recv:rsvp nsis


4.  Offer/answer Behavior

   An offer/answer exchange using the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-
   recv' attributes allows endpoints to come up with a list of common
   QoS mechanisms sorted by preference.  However, note that endpoints
   negotiate in which direction QoS is needed using other mechanisms,
   such as preconditions [RFC3312].  Endpoints may also use other
   mechanisms to negotiate, if needed, the parameters to use with a
   given QoS mechanism (e.g., bandwidth to be reserved).

4.1.  Offerer Behavior

   Offerers include a 'qos-mech-send' attribute with the tokens
   corresponding to the QoS mechanisms supported in the send direction
   in order of preference.  Similarly, offerers include a 'qos-mech-
   recv' attribute with the tokens corresponding to the QoS mechanisms
   supported in the receive direction in order of preference.

4.2.  Answerer Behavior

   On receiving an offer with a set of tokens in a 'qos-mech-send'
   attribute, the answerer takes those tokens corresponding to QoS
   mechanisms it supports in the receive direction and includes them, in
   order of preference, in a 'qos-mech-recv' attribute in the answer.
   On receiving an offer with a set of tokens in a 'qos-mech-recv'
   attribute, the answerer takes those tokens corresponding to QoS
   mechanisms it supports in the send direction and includes them, in
   order of preference, in a 'qos-mech-send' attribute in the answer.

   When ordering the tokens in a 'qos-mech-send' or a 'qos-mech-recv'
   attribute by preference, the answerer may take into account its own
   preferences and those expressed in the offer.  However, the exact

Internet-Draft       QoS Mechanism Selection in SDP         October 2008


   algorithm to be used to order such token lists is outside the scope
   of this specification.

   Note that if the answerer does not have any QoS mechanism in common
   with the offerer, it will return empty 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-
   recv' attributes.

4.3.  Resource Reservation

   Once the offer/answer exchange completes, both offerer and answerer
   use the token lists in the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv'
   attributes of the answer to perform resource reservations.  Offerers
   and answerers SHOULD attempt to use the QoS mechanism with highest
   priority in each direction first.  If an endpoint (the offerer or the
   answerer) does not succeed using the mechanism with highest priority
   in a given direction, it SHOULD attempt to use the next QoS mechanism
   in order of priority in that direction, and so on.

   If an endpoint tries unsuccessfully all the common QoS mechanisms for
   a given direction, the endpoint MAY attempt to use additional QoS
   mechanisms not supported by the remote endpoint.  This is because
   there may be network entities out of the endpoint's control (e.g., an
   RSVP proxy) that make those mechanisms work.

4.4.  Subsequent Offer/answer Exchanges

   If, during an established session for which the QoS mechanism to be
   used for a given direction was agreed using the mechanism defined in
   this specification, an endpoint receives a subsequent offer that does
   not contain the QoS selection attribute corresponding to that
   direction (i.e., the 'qos-mech-send' or 'qos-mech-recv' attribute is
   missing), the endpoints SHOULD continue using the same QoS mechanism
   used up to that moment.


5.  Example

   The following is an offer/answer exchange between two endpoints using
   the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv' attributes.  Parts of the
   session descriptions are ommitted for clarity purposes.

   The offerer generates the following session description listing both
   RSVP and NSIS for both directions.  The offerer would prefer to use
   RSVP and, thus, includes it before NSIS.

     m=audio 50000 RTP/AVP 0
     a=qos-mech-send: rsvp nsis
     a=qos-mech-recv: rsvp nsis

Internet-Draft       QoS Mechanism Selection in SDP         October 2008


   The answerer supports NSIS in both directions, but not RSVP.
   Consequently, it returns the following session description:

     m=audio 55000 RTP/AVP 0
     a=qos-mech-send: nsis
     a=qos-mech-recv: nsis


6.  IANA Considerations

   This specification registers two new SDP attributes and creates a new
   registry for QoS mechanisms.

6.1.  Registration of the SDP 'qos-mech-send' Attribute

   This section instructs the IANA to register the following SDP att-
   field under the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters
   registry:

   Contact name:   Gonzalo.Camarillo@ericsson.com

   Attribute name:   qos-mech-send

   Long-form attribute name:   QoS Mechanism for the Send Direction

   Type of attribute   Session and Media levels

   Subject to charset:   No

   Purpose of attribute:   To list QoS mechanisms supported in the send
      direction.

   Allowed attribute values:   IANA Registered Tokens

6.2.  Registration of the SDP 'qos-mech-recv' Attribute

   This section instructs the IANA to register the following SDP att-
   field under the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters
   registry:

   Contact name:   Gonzalo.Camarillo@ericsson.com

   Attribute name:   qos-mech-recv

Internet-Draft       QoS Mechanism Selection in SDP         October 2008


   Long-form attribute name:   QoS Mechanism for the Receive Direction

   Type of attribute   Session and Media levels

   Subject to charset:   No

   Purpose of attribute:   To list QoS mechanisms supported in the
      receive direction.

   Allowed attribute values:   IANA Registered Tokens

6.3.  Registry for QoS Mechanism Tokens

   The IANA is requested to create a subregistry for QoS mechanism token
   values to be used in the 'qos-mech-send' and 'qos-mech-recv'
   attributes under the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters
   registry.  The initial values for the subregistry are presented in
   the following, and IANA is requested to add them into its database:

      QoS Mechanism                Reference
      ---------------------------- ---------
      rsvp                         RFC xxxx
      nsis                         RFC xxxx

   [RFC Editor's note: please replace 'RFC xxxx' with the number this
   RFC will get.]

   As per the terminology in [RFC5226], the registration policy for new
   QoS mechanism token values shall be 'Specification Required'.


7.  Security Considerations

   An attacker may attempt to add, modify, or remove 'qos-mech-send' and
   'qos-mech-recv' attributes from a session description.  This could
   result in an application behaving in a non-desirable way.  For
   example, the endpoints under attack may not be able to find a common
   QoS mechanism to use.

   Consequently, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that integrity and
   authenticity protection be applied to SDP session descriptions
   carrying these attributes.  For session descriptions carried in SIP
   [RFC3261], S/MIME [RFC3851] is the natural choice to provide such
   end-to-end integrity protection, as described in [RFC3261].  Other
   applications MAY use a different form of integrity protection.
