Abstract

   The Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the most widely deployed
   protocol for securing network traffic.  It provides mutual
   authentication, data confidentiality and integrity, key generation
   and distribution, and security parameters negotiation.  However,
   missing from the protocol is a way to multiplex single-application
   multiple-stream applications that commonly use parallel connections
   to the same logical and/or physical server application data.

   This document describes a mechanism to multiplex single-application
   multiple-stream over TLS.  It extends TLS to multiplex parallel
   connections of a given application over a single TLS session,
   avoiding additional delay related to the TLS/TCP session/connection
   setup.

1.  Introduction

   A single-application multiple-stream/-thread/-connection commonly
   uses parallel connections to the same logical and/or physical server
   application data.  When that application is run over TCP, a TCP
   connection must be established for each stream/thread/connection
   (channel).  This incurs a significant additional delay due to the TCP
   slow-start and to the duplication of an existing TLS session as well.
   Having a single TCP connection and opening additional channels over
   that single TCP connection can benefit of a high TCP congestion
   window and throughput instantaneously via statistical multiplexing,
   and raising the throughput further (incrementally) from an already
   high level can be achieved much faster in TCP.

   TLS does not multiplex single-application multiple-channel; it must
   instead duplicate the existing TLS session for each channel.  This
   document defines Multiplexing Multi-Threaded Application over
   Transport Layer Security (MTA-TLS).  MTA-TLS extends TLS to multiplex
   a single-application multiple-channel over a single TLS session,
   avoiding additional delay related to the TLS/TCP session/connection
   setup.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  TLS multiplexing Overview and Considerations

   This document makes use of TLS extensions described in [RFC5246] and
   defines an extension of type data_multiplexing(TBD).  The
   "extension_data" field of this extension SHALL be empty (zero-
   length).

2.1.  Handshake

   The client and the server can, in an ordinary TLS handshake,
   negotiate the future use of MTA-TLS.  The negotiation usually starts
   with the client that indicates its support of MTA-TLS by including an
   extension of type 'data_multiplexing' in its hello message.

   If the client does attempt to initiate a TLS session using MTA-TLS
   with a server that does not support it, it will be automatically
   alerted.  For servers aware of MTA-TLS but not wishing to use it, it
   will gracefully revert to an ordinary TLS handshake or stop the
   negotiation.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-TLS                      April 2009


   If the server is able of and willing to use the "data_multiplexing"
   extension, it MUST reply with an empty extension of the same type.

   Once the Handshake is complete, both the client and the server can
   start 'channel multiplexing' using a set of requests/responses
   defined below.  All requests/responses will pass through MTA-TLS
   layer and are formatted into MTA-TLS packets, depending on each
   request/response.

2.1.1.  Opening Channels

   The sender MAY request the opening of many channels.  For each
   channel, the MTA-TLS layer generates and sends the following request:

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint16 length;
          opaque sender_channel_id[2];
          uint32 sender_window_length;
          uint32 sender_max_packet_length;
          opaque source_address_machine<1..2^16-1>;
          opaque source_port[2];
          opaque destination_address_machine<1..2^16-1>;
          opaque destination_port[2];
      } ChannelEstablishmentRequest;

   type

      The "type" field specifies the MTA-TLS packet type (types are
      summarized below).

   length

      The "length" field indicates the length, in octets, of the current
      MTA-TLS packet.

   sender_channel_id

      The "sender_channel_id" is the first half of the channel
      identifier.  The second half is generated by the receiver of that
      MTA-TLS packet.

   sender_window_length

      The "sender_window_length" field conveys the data length (in
      octets), specifying how many bytes the receiver of the packet can
      maximally send on the channel before receiving a new window length
      (available free space).  Each end of the channel establishes a

Internet-Draft                   MTA-TLS                      April 2009


      "receive buffer" and a "send buffer".

   sender_max_packet_length

      The "sender_max_packet_length" field conveys the data length (in
      octets), specifying the maximal packet's length in octets the
      receiver of that packet can send on the channel.  The
      sender_max_packet_length is always smaller than the free space of
      the sender_window_length (the sender's "receive buffer").

   source_address_machine and source_port

      The "source_address_machine" MAY carry either the numeric IP
      address or the domain name of the host from where the application
      originates the data multiplexing request and the "source_port" is
      the port on the host from where the connection originated.

   destination_address_machine and destination_port

      The "destination_address_machine" and "destination_port" specify
      the TCP/IP host and port where the recipient should connect the
      channel.  The "destination_address_machine" MAY be either a domain
      name or a numeric IP address.

   The receiver decides whether it can open the channel, and replies
   with one of the following messages:

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint16 length;
          opaque sender_channel_id[2];
          opaque receiver_channel_id[2];
          uint32 receiver_window_length;
          uint32 receiver_max_packet_length;
      } ChannelEstablishmentSuccess;

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint16 length;
          opaque sender_channel_id[2];
          opaque error<0..2^16-6>;
      } ChannelRequestEchec;

   The "sender_channel_id" and "receiver_channel_id" are the same
   generated during the channel establishment.  The length conveys the
   data length of the current packet.

   The field "error" conveys a description of the error.

Internet-Draft                   MTA-TLS                      April 2009


   Each MTA-TLS channel has its identifier computed as:

          channel_id = sender_channel_id + receiver_channel_id

   Where "+" indicates concatenation.

   Note: channel_id may be susceptible to collisions.  The receiver
   needs to take care not to choose a "receiver_channel_id" to avoid any
   collide with any of the established channel identifiers.

2.1.2.  Closing Channels

   The following packet MAY be sent to notify the receiver that the
   sender will not send any more data on this channel and that any data
   received after a closure request will be ignored.  The sender of the
   closure request MAY close its "receive buffer" without waiting for
   the receiver's response.  However, the receiver MUST respond with a
   confirmation of the closure and close down the channel immediately,
   discarding any pending writes.

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint16 length;
          opaque channel_id[4];
      } ChannelCloseRequest;

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint16 length;
          opaque channel_id[4];
      } ChannelCloseConfirmation;

   The above two packets can be sent even if no window space is
   available.

2.2.  MTA-TLS Flow Control

   The structure of the MTA-TLS data packet is described below.

   Each entity maintains its "max_packet_length" (that is originally
   initialized during the channel establishment) to a value not bigger
   than the free space of its "receive buffer".  For each received
   packet, the receiver MUST subtract the packet's length from the free
   space of its "receive buffer".  For each transmitted packet, the
   sender MUST subtract the packet's length from the free space of its
   "send buffer".  In any case, the result is always positive.

   If the entity is willing to notify the other side about any change in

Internet-Draft                   MTA-TLS                      April 2009


   the "max_packet_length", the entity MUST send a NewMaxPacketLength
   conveying the new "max_packet_length" that MUST be smaller than the
   free space of the entity's "receive buffer"

   The free space of the "receive buffer" of the sender (resp. the
   receiver) MAY increase in length.  The sender SHOULD send an
   Acknowledgment packet to inform the receiver about this increase,
   allowing this latter to send more packets but with length smaller or
   equal than the minimum of the "max_packet_length" and the "receive
   buffer" of the sender.

   If the length of the "receive buffer" does not change, the
   Acknowledgment packet will never be sent.

   In the case where the "receive buffer" of an entity fills up, the
   other entity MUST wait for an Acknowledgment packet before sending
   any more MTATLSPlaintext packets.

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint32 length;
          opaque channel_id[4];
          opaque data[MTATLSPlaintext.length];
      } MTATLSPlaintext;

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint16 length;
          opaque channel_id[4];
          uint32 max_packet_length;
          /* the max_packet_length of the sender of that packet */
      } NewMaxPacketLength;

      struct {
          uint8  type;
          uint16 length;
          opaque channel_id[4];
          uint32 free_space;
      } Acknowledgment;

   The Acknowledgment and NewMaxPacketLength packets can be sent even if
   no window space is available.

   The TLS Record Layer receives data from MTA-TLS, supposes it as
   uninterpreted data and applies the fragmentation and the
   cryptographic operations on it, as defined in [RFC5246].

   Note: multiple MTA-TLS fragments MAY be coalesced into a single

   TLSPlaintext record.

   Received data is decrypted, verified, decompressed, and reassembled,
   then delivered to MTA-TLS entity.  Next, the MTA-TLS sends data to
   the appropriate application using the channel identifier and the
   length value.

2.3.  MTA-TLS Message Types

   This section defines the initial set of MTA-TLS Message Types used in
   Request/Response exchanges.  The Message Type field is one octet and
   identifies the structure of an MTA-TLS Request or Response message.

   The messages defined in this document are listed below.  More Message
   Types may be defined in future documents.  The list of Message Types,
   as defined through this document, is maintained by the Internet
   Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA).  Thus, an application needs to be
   made to the IANA in order to obtain a new Message Type value.  Since
   there are subtle (and not-so-subtle) interactions that may occur in
   this protocol between new features and existing features that may
   result in a significant reduction in overall security, new values
   SHALL be defined only through the IETF Review process specified in
   [RFC5226].

                      ChannelEstablishmentRequest        1
                      ChannelEstablishmentSuccess        2
                      ChannelRequestEchec                3
                      ChannelCloseRequest                4
                      ChannelCloseConfirmation           5
                      MTATLSPlaintext                    6
                      NewMaxPacketLength                 7
                      Acknowledgment                     8

3.  Security Considerations

   Security issues are discussed throughout this document and in
   [RFC5246].

   If a fatal error related to any channel of an arbitrary application
   occurs, the secure session MUST NOT be resumed.  This is logic since
   the Record protocol does not distinguish between the MTA-TLS
   channels.  However, if an error occurs at the MTA-TLS layer, both
   parties immediately close the related channel, but not the TLS
   session (no alert of any type is sent by the TLS Record).

4.  IANA Considerations

   This section provides guidance to the IANA regarding registration of
   values related to the TLS protocol.

   There are name spaces that require registration: the
   data_multiplexing extension and the MTA-TLS message types.

   Message Types have a range from 1 to 255, of which 1-8 are to be
   allocated for this document.  Because a new Message Type has
   considerable impact on interoperability, a new Message Type SHALL be
   defined only through the IETF Review process specified in [RFC5226].
