1. Abstract 
    
   This draft describes a method to reduce the PPP framing overhead 
   used to transport small packets over slow links. The method, PPP 
   Multiplexing, sends multiple PPP encapsulated packets in a single 
   PPP frame. As a result, the PPP overhead per packet is reduced. 
     
2. Description 
    
   PPP encapsulation (for example with PPP in HDLC framing) adds 
   several bytes of overhead: a HDLC flag (at least one to separate  
   adjacent packets), the Address (0xFF) and Control (0x03) field  
   bytes, a two byte PPP Protocol ID, and the two byte CRC field. Even  
   with  the Address and Control Fields negotiated off and the PPP  
   Protocol ID compressed, each PPP encapsulated frame will include  
   four bytes of overhead. When PPP frames are tunneled, as in L2TP 
   [1], the L2TP overhead per PPP frame is significant.  
    
   The key idea is to concatenate multiple PPP encapsulated frames into 
   a single PPP multiplexed frame by inserting a delimiter before the 
   beginning of each frame. The description of the delimiters is 
   provided in Subsection 2.1. The delimiters are used by the

   demultiplexor to separate the PPP frames within the multiplexed 
   frame. Each PPP encapsulated frame within the multiplexed frame is 
   called a PPP subframe.  
  
   During the NCP negotiation phase of PPP, a receiver can offer to 
   receive multiplexed frames using the PPP Mux Control Protocol 
   (PPPMuxCP), as described in Section 3. Once PPPMuxCP has been 
   negotiated, the transmitter may choose which PPP frames to 
   multiplex. Frames should not be re-ordered by either the transmitter 
   or receiver regardless of whether they arrive as part of the PPP 
   multiplexed frame or by themselves. 
 
   The scheme proposed is similar to the concatenated framing option 
   [2]. The key differences are that PPP multiplexing is more efficient 
   and that it allows concatenation of variable sized frames. This is 
   unlike concatenated framing which restricts all frames to be of 
   fixed length.  
    
   As with any concatenation scheme, the implementer has to consider 
   the tradeoff between increased delay for multiplexing/demultiplexing 
   and reduced packet overhead as the length of the multiplexed frame 
   increases. 
  
 
2.1. Payload Format 
    
   The format of the complete PPP frame along with multiple subframes 
   for PPP in HDLC-like framing [3] is shown in Figure 1. Note that
   regardless of the order in which individual bits are transmitted, 
   i.e. LSB first or MSB first, the PFF bit will be seen to be the MSB 
   of a byte that contains both the PFF and the subframe length field.

   PPP Header: 
        The PPP header contains the PPP Protocol Field for a PPP 
        Multiplexed Frame (0x0059). The PPP header compression 
        options (ACFC and PFC) may be negotiated during LCP and 
        could thus affect the format of this header. 
    
   Length Field:

                               PPP Mux                 February, 2001 
 
 
        The length field consists of three subfields: 
    
    1. Protocol Field Flag (PFF): 
        The PFF refers to the most significant bit of the first byte of 
        each subframe. This one bit field indicates whether the PPP 
        Protocol ID of the subframe follows the subframe length field. 
        For the first subframe, the PFF bit could be set to zero if the 
        PPP protocol ID of the first subframe is equal to the default 
        PID value negotiated in PPPMuxCP. PFF = 1 indicates that the 
        protocol field is present (and follows the length field) for 
        this subframe. PFF = 0 indicates that the protocol field is 
        absent for this subframe. If PFF = 0 then the PPP Protocol ID 
        is the same as that of the preceding subframe with PFF = 1, or 
        it is equal to default PID value of the PPPMuxCP Option for the 
        first subframe. The transmitter is not obligated to remove the 
        PPP Protocol ID for any subframe. 
        
    2. Length Extension (LXT) 
        This one bit field indicates whether the length field is one  
        byte or two bytes long. If the LXT bit is set, then the  
        length field is two bytes long (a PFF bit, a length extension  
        bit, and 14 bits of sub-frame length). If the LXT bit is  
        cleared, then the length field is one byte long(a PFF bit, a  
        length extension bit, and 6 bits of sub-frame length). 
    
    3. Sub-frame Length (LEN):  
        This is the length of the subframe in bytes not including the  
        length field. However, it does include the PPP Protocol ID if  
        present (i.e. if PFF = 1). If the length of the subframe is  
        less than 64 bytes (less than or equal to 63 bytes), LXT is set  
        to zero and the last six bits of the length field is  
        the subframe length. If the length of the subframe is greater  
        than 63 bytes, LXT is set to one and the last 14 bits of the  
        length field is the length of the subframe. The maximum  
        length of a subframe is 16,383 bytes. PPP packets larger than  
        16,383 bytes will need to be sent in their own PPP frame. A  
        transmitter is not required to multiplex all frames smaller  
        than 16,383 bytes. It may chose to only multiplex frames  
        smaller than a configurable size into a PPP multiplexed frame. 
    
   Protocol Field: 
        This field contains the Protocol Field value for the subframe. 
        This field is optional. If PFF = 1 for a subframe, the 
        protocol field is present in the subframe, otherwise it is 
        inferred at the receiver. 
    
        The receiver MUST support Protocol-Field-Compression (PFC) 
        [4] for subframe PPP Protocol IDs. Thus the field may be  
        one or two bytes long. The transmitter SHOULD 
        compress PPP Protocol IDs in this field that have an upper 
        byte of zero (i.e. Protocol IDs from 0x21 thru 0xFD). This

                               PPP Mux                 February, 2001 
 
 
        Protocol Field Compression in each PPP subframe is not related 
        to the negotiation of PFC during LCP negotiation which affects 
        the length of PPP Multiplexed Frame Protocol ID. 
    
   Information Field: 
        This field contains the actual packet being encapsulated. 
        Any frame may be included here with the exception of LCP  
        Configure Request, ACK, NAK and Reject frames and PPP  
        Multiplexed frames. If LCP is renegotiated then PPP 
        Multiplexing MUST be disabled until the PPP Mux Control 
        Protocol is negotiated. 
        
2.2 Transmitter procedure 
    
   A simple implementation of the transmitter is provided. During the 
   transmission of a multiplexed PPP frame, the transmitter has a state 
   variable, Last_PID, which is used to hold the most recent value of 
   protocol field in a subframe with PFF=1. At the start of the 
   multiplexing process, Last_PID is set equal to the default PID value 
   negotiated in PPPMuxCP. Also, a user configurable parameter, maximum 
   subframe length (MAX_SF_LEN), is used to determine the maximum size 
   of a PPP frame which can be multiplexed. The value of MAX_SF_LEN 
   should be less or equal to the minimum of MRU-2(maximum size of 
   length field) and 16,383 (14 bits).   
    
   After transmitting a PPP frame (multiplexed or not) on the channel, 
   the PPP multiplexing logic looks at the buffers that hold the PPP 
   frames to be transmitted. In case there are multiple frames, the PPP 
   multiplexing logic checks if the length of the first frame in the 
   buffer is less than or equal to MAX_SF_LEN bytes. If so, the 
   transmitter starts compiling a multiplexed PPP frame with the 
   protocol field value corresponding to PPP Multiplexed Frame (0x59). 
   For each subframe, the test for deciding to prepend the protocol 
   field to a subframe is to compare the protocol field value of the 
   subframe to Last_PID. If they are equal, PFF is set to 0 and the 
   protocol field is deleted. If not, PFF is set to 1, the protocol 
   field is included, after PFC, in the subframe and Last_PID is set to 
   the protocol field value of the current subframe. The stopping 
   criteria in the concatenation process are (i) when the length of the 
   next subframe is greater than MAX_SF_LEN bytes or (ii) the length of 
   the entire PPP frame by including the new subframe exceeds the 
   maximum receive unit (MRU) parameter negotiated during LCP [4], or 
   (iii) there are no more subframes to concatenate. 
    
   Implementers may choose additionally to implement using timers. In 
   such a case a timeout in addition to the conditions stated above is 
   used as a stopping criteria of the multiplexing process. Moreover, 
   it may be desirable to limit the maximum size of a multiplexed 
   packet to be considerably smaller than MRU for reasons of 
   multiplexing latency and packet error considerations.

2.3 Receiver procedure 
    
   If a multiplexed frame, i.e. a frame with Protocol field value equal 
   to PPP Multiplexed Frame (0x0059), is received, the frame is 
   demultiplexed in order using the following input demultiplexing 
   logic. Similar to a transmitter, the receiver has a state variable 
   called Last_rcvd_PID, which is the value of the protocol field in 
   the most recently demultiplexed subframe with PFF=1. Last_rcvd_PID 
   is initialized to default PID value negotiated by PPPMuxCP. If PFF=0 
   for a subframe, Last_rcvd_PID is appended to the beginning of the 
   subframe before handing the subframe, as determined by the length 
   field, to the PPP logic. If PFF=1 for a subframe, Last_rcvd_PID is 
   set to this value and the subframe, as determined by the length 
   field, is passed to PPP logic. The remainder of the frame is 
   returned to the demultiplexor. Each succeeding subframe is processed 
   similarly. This processing is complete when the remainder of the 
   frame is empty, or when the size field of a subframe exceeds the 
   amount of data remaining in a packet. In the latter case, there is 
   an error either in the length field of the last subframe or in the 
   length field of one of the previous subframes. In either case the 
   last subframe must be dropped by the demultiplexing logic. 
    
   It is illegal to put a multiplexed frame within a multiplexed frame. 
    
    
3. PPP Network Control Protocol for PPP Multiplexing (PPPMuxCP) 
    
   A receiver will offer its ability to received multiplexed frames by 
   negotiating NCP for PPP multiplexing, PPPMuxCP. The protocol field 
   value for a PPPMuxCP frames is 0x8059. PPPMuxCP is similar to other 
   NCPs such as IPCP [6]. A transmitter may not send a multiplexed 
   frame unless the peer has offered to receive multiplexed frames. 
   Support of multiplexed frame reception is negotiated in each 
   direction independently. Successful negotiation of PPPMuxCP does not 
   obligate a peer to transmit multiplexed frames. 
    
   As part of the PPPMuxCP negotiation, a 'default PID' option is 
   always negotiated. This enables the transmitter to transmit the 
   first subframe of a PPP multiplexed frame without a PID (PFF=0), 
   thus resulting in a saving of one or two bytes. Note that the 
   negotiation of default PID does not require the transmitter to send 
   the first subframe with PFF=0 even if doing so would optimize the 
   transmission. And, as always, the option (and thus the default PID) 
   is negotiated by the receiver, i.e. the receiver will interpret a 
   received PPPmux packet using the default PID it offered. 
    
   LCP frames MUST NOT be sent in Multiplexed frames.

   The only option in PPPMuxCP is the negotiation of Default PID and is 
   shown below

4. Interaction with PPP Multilink (MP) Protocol  
    
   PPP multiplexed frame option is negotiated by an NCP.  LCP is 
   negotiated over each member link of a multilink bundle and not on 
   the bundle itself [5]. Thus in case of MP, PPPmux cannot be 
   negotiated for individual links, but only for the bundle.  
    
   Hence, on the transmitter side PPP multiplexing always occurs before 
   multilink PPP encapsulation. On a link, an MP header (if present) 
   MUST be outside of a PPPmux header (if present). Multilink frames 
   must not be sent in Multiplexed frames. 
    
    
5. Interaction with CCP and ECP 
    
   PPP multiplexing must be performed below (after) any bundle-level 
   CCP and/or ECP, and above (before) MP and any per-link CCP and/or 
   ECP.  Thus,  to negotiate the hypothetical transmit path sequence 
   CCP -> PPPMux -> ECP, the bundle-level version of CCP (80fd) and the 
   per-link version of ECP (8055) are negotiated along with the PPPMux 
   Option. 
    
   An implementation that cannot perform PPPMux above CCP or ECP MUST 
   issue Protocol-Reject for the per-link forms of CCP and ECP if 
   PPPMux has been negotiated. 
    
    
6. Security Considerations 
 
   This draft does not impose additional security considerations beyond 
   those that apply to PPP and header-compression schemes over PPP.
