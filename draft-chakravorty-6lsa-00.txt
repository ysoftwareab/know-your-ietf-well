  This document provides specifications for IPv6 label switching architecture (6LSA) 
  and associated IPv6 packet transport mechanisms.   
    
Abstract 
    
   This specification provides an architectural framework, called IPv6 Label 
   Switching Architecture or 6LSA, for an end-to-end, IP-centric packet switching 
   technique that uses the IPv6 packet header Flow Label, header extensions, and 
   unique routing algorithms, the latter two when needed, to establish IPv6-based 
   label switched paths.  The label switched paths, called 6LSPs, provide application 
   and user specified routes for speedier transport of packets and as means for 
   quality of service (QoS) solutions as in IPv4-based MPLS or ATM.  Since MPLS-like 
   protocol labeling will be redundant for IPv6 and since there are no widely-known 
   QoS deployments of IPv6 over any of the layer 2 switching mechanisms such as ATM, 
   the 6LSA framework fills the technology void without the link overhead from 
   extraneous layer 2 labeling and signaling of MPLS, or packet fragmentation and 
   added signaling as in ATM.  Through the use of fast switching of 20-bit labels 
   instead of 128-bit IPv6 address look-ups, the architecture presented here also 
   provides processing savings through significantly reduced address fetches for the 
   low-powered, handheld devices.

    Introduction 
    
   Several approaches have been developed over the past decade to provide packet 
   switching and QoS to IPv4 flows.  These include MPLS, ATM, extensions to routing 
   protocols such as IGP, IS-IS and OSPF, and proprietary.  Some of these techniques 
   can also be applied to IPv6 transport but not directly.  An MPLS mechanism for 
   IPv6 would amount to redundant labeling; what is commonly proposed is IPv6 to IPv4 
   translation or tunneling and then using MPLS.  There is no widely known deployment 
   where one or more of the common layer 2 switching techniques have been used with 
   IPv6 for QoS delivery.  However, IPv6 offers strong features to enable switching 
   of IPv6 packets, most significant among them are the provision of the Flow Label 
   and the Routing Header extension.  This framework thus fills the void that absence 
   of such IPv6 switching technologies present.   
    
   The IPv6 Label Switching Architecture (6LSA) eliminates the link overhead from 
   extraneous layer 2 labeling and signaling as in MPLS, or packet fragmentation and 
   added signaling as in ATM.  The fast switching of 20-bit labels instead of 128-bit 
   IPv6 address look-ups also provides processing savings because address fetches for 
   low-powered, handheld devices, which are mostly 32-bit architectures, would be 
   four times as fast.    
    
   This document introduces an architectural framework for the use of IPv6 packet 
   header Flow Labels for setting up label switched paths of local significance to 
   provide QoS for connection-oriented flows that cannot be provided by a purely 
   routed, connectionless approach.  The 6LSA allows local label generation that can

   help update label values in a synchronized manner across the network to reduce 
   man-in-the-middle attacks.  In essence, the 6LSA provides the means for static and 
   mobile nodes to set up label switched paths, automatically and/or manually, to 
   provide secure end-to-end QoS.  
    
2. 
  Overview 
    
   The IPv6 label switching mechanism makes use of the 20-bit Flow Label in the IPv6 
   header to assign flow IDs which are used for IPv6 Flow Label switched paths, also 
   called IPv6 label switched paths (6LSPs).  The specification of IPv6 label is in 
   conformance with [2] RFC 3697, IPv6 Flow Label Specification, in which the use of 
   Flow Label has been recommended for establishing different types of flows end-to-
   end. Indeed, the proposed mechanism of IPv6 label switching significantly broadens 
   the scope of the use of Flow Labels beyond its mere use for flow identification. 
    
   In a conventional router, the forwarding decision is independently made in each 
   router as the packet travels from one router to the next.  In each router, the 
   packetÆs header is analyzed using a network layer routing algorithm to find the 
   best next-hop that is often the shortest distance to the next router.  Since this 
   forwarding in each router is "independent" of how the previous packet for the same 
   destination was processed and forwarded, the routing is considered connectionless. 
    
   As noted in [1] ¡ RFC 3031, MPLS Architecture, e. Rosen, et al, IP packet header 
   contains significantly more information than is needed for the selection of the 
   best next hop.  The process specified in this document provides two functions: 
   first, grouping of packets of similar flow requirements into a Forwarding 
   Equivalence Class (FEC), and second, forwarding all packets belonging to an FEC 
   along the same path or set of paths, the latter when multiple paths are allowed, 
   for example, in case of load balancing.  The assignment of packets to an FEC is 
   called binding.   
    
   In 6LSA, the FEC may be encoded in the Flow Label field as a non-zero value, which 
   is also called label in this document.  The label is thus either available in the 
   incoming packetÆs Flow Label, locally generated based on certain algorithm or 
   policy, or distributed through a label distribution process.   
    
   Once a binding of a label to a given FEC is performed, the forwarding treatment of 
   the packet may be represented through the label and is maintained at a minimum for 
   the duration of the session.  As in the MPLS Architecture [1], a packet is labeled 
   before it is forwarded, however, unlike MPLS, the label may be strictly local-node 
   based as also the processing of the packet.  
    
   Several models for how to build and use the 6LSA labels are presented in this 
   document.  The IP packet header, specifically the IPv6 packet header, contains 
   more information than is needed to determine the next hop and forward the packet.  
   The 6LSA label can easily support the forwarding of packets belonging to the same 
   FEC along a 6LSP.  
    
   In the 6LSA, only the first packet of a flow is analyzed for FEC determination and 
   label selection.  Subsequent packets of the same flow may not go through the same 
   process of label selection and assignment.   
    
   Packet forwarding is done using the label only after the label binding to a FEC 
   has taken place.  
    
   At each router, the label assigned to a packet, along with the packetÆs source and 
   destination addresses, and other processing criteria are entered into a packet 
   forwarding table, also called a switching table.  The label is assigned to the 
   lead packet of a flow, which may or may not be the same as first packet of the 
   flow.  As subsequent packets arrive, the switching table is checked using the

   algorithms described here to see if there is a label for the flow.  If none 
   exists, a label is assigned to the packet and the packet is treated as a lead 
   packet.  If a label value exists in the switching table, then the packet is given 
   the same forwarding treatment as the label binding indicates. 
    
   Since the packet forwarding decision can be made based on the switching look up, 
   the packet processing is fast, as per a known forwarding treatment, and takes 
   place over a known path. 
    
   The selection of a label is based on the FEC which itself is based on one or more 
   packet characteristics.  What characteristics should be chosen for what FEC is an 
   administrative, QoS, or policy decision, or a combination thereof.  Such a 
   decision is meant to support certain traffic engineering requirements, such as 
   those based on DSCP code points or other similar values encoded or configured into 
   the Traffic Class field of IPv6 packet header.  This selection and encoding 
   procedure is outside the scope of this specification.  Selection of FEC may be a 
   configurable parameter of the router, server, host or any other device that 
   implements this specification of 6LSA.    
    
   Finally, 6LSA is applicable to any device that is capable of processing and 
   forwarding IPv6 packets.  This protocol is not constrained by any layer 2 or layer 
   1 technology.

    Terminology 
    
  This section provides a general overview of the terms used in this document.  Some 
  of these terms are more precisely defined in the later sections of this document.  
  Most of the definitions mirror those provided in RFC 3031 [1] and are applied to 
  the 6LSA specification as appropriate for consistency. 
   
   
     FEC                     Forwarding Equivalent Class; the forwarding treatment 
                            that a collection of IP packets receives; such 
                            packets all have the same characteristics from a 
                            QoS perspective, receive the same forwarding 
                            treatment, and are generally forwarded over the 
                            same label switched path (6LSP)

     label merging           the replacement of multiple incoming labels with a 
                            single outgoing label

                            an incoming label to determine the outgoing label, 
                            port, and other data handling information and then 
                            replacing the incoming label with the outgoing 
                            label which may or may not be the same as the 
                            incoming label

4. 
    Distinguishing Characteristics of 6LSA  
    
   The 6LSA characteristics justify its application wherever IPv6 is deployed and 
   where QoS network performance delivery is required or where other available packet 
   switching mechanisms cannot deliver network performance end-to-end.  The special 
   characteristics of 6LSA are listed here in no particular order: 
    
   o  IP Transparency End-to-End - By being a layer 3 protocal and by  
      avoiding encapsulation (as in MPLS) or fragmentation (as in ATM) of IP, the 
      6LSA retains the IP transparency end-to-end.  
       
   o  No-Extraneous-Label-Binding Option ¡ 6LSA offers the option to avoid the use of 
      any extraneous labels and thus avoid the need for label distribution across 
      the network in the control plane as is done in MPLS. 
       
   o  No Label Distribution Protocols - There is no need for label  
      distribution protocol so as to be able to map labels to addresses across the 
      network(s). 
       
   o  Elimination of Label Distribution Traffic ¡ Absent a control  
      plane for label distribution, there is no control plane traffic. 
       
   o  No Label Distribution State Machine ¡ Without label distribution,  
      there is no need for a separate state machine for the maintenance of 
      extraneous labels. 
       
   o  Free of Layer 2 Overheads - Being a layer 3 packet switching  
      solution, 6LSA does not need a layer 2 packet switching mechanism  
      such as ATM, MPLS or switched Frame Relay and as such 6LSA avoids ATMÆs 
      fragmentation and reassembly of IP packets and thus eliminates the resulting 
      header overhead.  It also avoids the need for added signaling and state 
      machine mechanisms to provide ATM switched paths and ship-by-night 
      capabilities.  Additionally, 6LSA tends to avoid the potential for O(N2) and 
      O(N3) problems.   
       
   o  Deployment Ease - The 6LSA can be deployed over simple layer 2  
      protocols such as Ethernet and PPP.  This should help expedite the deployment 
      of IP over DWDM.  There is no layer 2 interface limitation in 6LSA. 
       
   o  Extensive QoS Label Space - The 20-bit Flow Label in addition to  
      the 8-bit Traffic Class field can provide a huge traffic classification space 
      if needed, conversely, both the fields may be used together in the 6LSA.  
      (This is a subject for further work and documentation.)  Neither MPLS or nor 
      ATM provides this capability, indeed MPLS is allowed to forfeit up to 5 bits 
      from its label space for QoS marking. 
       
   o  Feature Visibility to Applications ¡ Unlike ATM or MPLS, all of  
      IPv6Æs packet features are available to upper layer APIs.  In the case of ATM, 
      whole IP packets have to be reassembled for common IP APIs to work, while in 
      MPLS, one or more labels have to be removed.

   o  Extensive Operational Flexibility - 6LSA provides the flexibility  
      between switching and routing as needed without the need for label popping or 
      any additional processing for exiting the 6LSA mode of operation and then 
      again reverting back to 6LSA.  Thus any two peering nodes can have a best-
      effort routing between them on a pair of interfaces while on other interfaces, 
      the same two nodes may forward the same packets over 6LSPs.  The 6LSA thus 
      allows the best of both worlds for transmission ¡ one with a single class of 
      traffic and the other with multiple classes of traffic. 
       
   o  Security Enhancement ¡ since 6LSA allows node-local generation of  
      labels, such generation where adopted can be made totally random or 
      periodically synchronized across the 6LSA domain to considerably reduce man-
      in-the-middle attacks. 
       
    o  Hop Limit field - the 8-bit hop limit field in the IPv6 header  
      is available for loop prevention.  There is no need to port this value to an 
      extraneous label. 
       
   o  No MTU Violation ¡ since the packet size does not change because  
      of the addition of extraneous labels, 6LSA eliminates the potential for MTU 
      violations. 
       
   o  Fast Switching in IPv6 ¡ the 6LSA protocol provides for a fast  
      label switching mechanism heretofore available only in IPv4  
      through the use of MPLS. 
    
   To summarize, 6LSA provides a significantly efficient and powerful layer 3 
   mechanism for switching IP packets - with little or no added overhead for 
   establishing label switched paths - for end-to-end, granular QoS delivery.    
    
    
5. 
   Routing Versus Switching of IP Traffic 
    
   The routing of packets on the Internet has the following essential 
   characteristics. 
    
   ¡  Routing is connectionless and comprises non-sequential packet  
      transport. 
   
   ¡  The technique is essentially store-and-forward and involves slow route 
       processing.  
   
   ¡  The paths are not dedicated (non-switched) virtual paths - for the duration of 
       a session, the inter-router or inter-device paths may vary many times for a 
       given flow. 
   
   ¡  There are generally no delivery or QoS guarantees - a single class of traffic 
       is available. 
   
   ¡  The process is geared more toward routing flexibility than speed. 
   
   ¡  The routing protocols are generally developed by the IETF. 
    
    
   Switching of packets has the following basic characteristics. 
    
    ¡  The ôroutingö of packets is connection-oriented; the flow of packets comprises 
       sequential packets. 
    
    ¡  The packet processing can be cut-through and therefore extremely fast.

    ¡  The packets travel over dedicated, virtual paths which are either permanent or 
       temporary. 
    
    ¡  Switching is generally associated with certain delivery guarantees and traffic 
       classification.   
    
    ¡  The technique is geared more toward speed than routing flexibility. 
    
   The issues with switching are: 
    
    ¡  There are delays caused by VC setup time across the network.  
    
    ¡  There is the need for VC state maintenance. 
    
    ¡  IP address to VC translation latency is always present however small. 
    
    ¡  Hardware performance has not always been up to demand since switching is a 
       rather fast process. 
    
    ¡  Potential for large resource wastage in case of link or node failure in IP 
       virtual network over switched network, for example IP over ATM that may cause 
       N2 and N3 problems.  
    
    ¡  Generally there is no error correction enroute. 
    
    ¡  Most switching protocols are not developed by the IETF.  The 6LSA overcomes 
   most of these disadvantages as will be shown below.

    6LSA Basic Components and Their Attributes 
 
In this section, we define the basic components and their attributes pertaining to an 
IPv6. 
 
 
6.1 
     Label 
 
Labels are 20-bit, fixed length Flow Label identifiers in the IPv6 header that a node 
in the 6LSA binds to a Forwarding Equivalency Class (FEC) and uses it to forward the 
packet.  The label thus represents the FEC.  In the 6LSA, the FEC indicates the 
forwarding treatment a group or class of packets (with a given label) receives.  This 
label and the FEC it represents have only local (per hop) significance unless the 
attributes associated with a FEC are shared among multiple nodes. 
 
A label in an incoming packet is called an ôincoming labelö, and that in an outgoing 
packet is called an ôoutgoing label.ö 
 
A label is associated with both the flow and Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC).  A 
flow cannot be identified without a label; the forwarding treatment associated with a 
FEC may be identified by the value of the label. 
 
In this document, the nomenclature of label or Flow Label is variously used though 
the meaning is the same and while referring to the word label used in other 
technologies, such as in MPLS, the context of the technology is also mentioned to 
distinguish the application and meaning of the word. 
 
 
6.2 
     Flow 
 


 
 
Chakravorty                Expires - December 2004                  [Page 8] 
draft-chakravorty-6lsa-00.txt                                August 2004 
 
 
A flow is a sequence of packets sent from a particular source node to a particular 
unicast, anycast or multicast destination node for which the source node desires 
special handling by the intervening nodes.  The nature of that special handling might 
be conveyed to the routers by a control protocol, such as the resource reservation 
protocol (RSVP), Differentiated Services Traffic Engineering (DSTE) mechanism, or by 
information within the flow's packets themselves.  
 
A flow comprises source and destination addresses as well as the label value in the 
Flow Label. All packets belonging to the same flow must be sent with the same source 
address, destination address and flow label.   
 
   There may be multiple active flows in the 6LSA at any given time.  Further 
applicable statements are quoted here from [3] RFC 2460 for clarity. 
 
ôA flow label is assigned to a flow by the flow's source node.  New    flow labels 
must be chosen (pseudo-)randomly and uniformly from the   range 1 to FFFFF hex.  The 
purpose of the random allocation is to   make any set of bits within the Flow Label 
field suitable for use as   a hash key by routers, for looking up the state 
associated with the   flow. 
 
If any of those packets includes a Hop-by-Hop Options header, then they all must be 
originated with the same Hop-by-Hop Options header contents   (excluding the Next 
Header field of the Hop-by-Hop Options header). 
 
If any of those packets includes a Routing header, then they all must be originated 
with the same contents in all extension headers up to   and including the Routing 
header (excluding the Next Header field in   the Routing header).  The routers or 
destinations are permitted, but   not required, to verify that these conditions are 
satisfied.  If a   violation is detected, it should be reported to the source by an 
ICMP 
Parameter Problem message, Code 0, pointing to the high-order octet of the Flow Label 
field (i.e., offset 1 within the IPv6 packet). 
 
The maximum lifetime of any flow-handling state established along a flow's path must 
be specified as part of the description of the   state-establishment mechanism, e.g., 
the resource reservation   protocol or the flow-setup hop-by-hop option.  A source 
must not re-   use a flow label for a new flow within the maximum lifetime of any   
flow-handling state that might have been established for the prior   use of that flow 
label.ö 
 
 
6.3 
     Pseudoflow 
 
This specification introduces the concept of pseudoflow.  In 6LSA, if a Flow Label 
has a zero value, a 0 (zero) label, the packet containing such a label may still be 
treated as a part of a group of packets in a ôflowö in which all packets have the 
same source and destination addresses and the same label binding to FEC.  The 6LSA 
node may bind the packet to a FEC and process the packet such that it can later be 
associated with other packets with the same source and destination addresses and FEC 
binding.  The transmission of such packets is called a pseudoflow to distinguish it 
from the conventional version of flow that comprises a non-zero label. 
 
In a pseudoflow, packets may carry source address of a node other than where the 
pseudoflow originated and destination address of a node other than where the 
pseudoflow will terminate.  Thus, a pseudoflow originating at an upstream node, which 
may not be the source node, continues to the next-hop node and terminates in the 
next-hop node, which may not be the destination node.  The label binding in the lead 
packet may be reused for a pseudoflow going via nodes downstream of the pseudoflow 
origination node.   
 
In this document, for simplicity, a pseudoflow is often called a flow when the 
context is clearly stated.

6.4 
     Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) 
 
The Forwarding Equivalence Class (FEC) represents forwarding treatment a group of 
IPv6 packets receive.  The forwarding treatment may be based on one or more 
attributes associated with the flow or other processing requirements imposed on the 
flow externally.   
 
Several flows from multiple sources may receive the same forwarding treatment and 
thus belong to the same FEC.  For example, if multiple flows are to be processed in 
the same outgoing queue because they all deliver the same QoS, they are identified by 
the same FEC. 
 
 
6.5 
     Labeled Packet 
 
In 6LSA, a packet that has a label value that a node can bind to a FEC is called a 
labeled packet.  A labeled packet is an IPv6 packet whose header has a zero or non-
zero Flow Label value.   
 
All packets in a flow in 6LSA have a non-zero label value, while all packets in a 
pseudoflow may have zero label value.  If an incoming packet into a 6LSA node has a 
zero label value and it is not a lead packet (see Section 6.7), it is assigned a non-
zero label value before forwarding it.  This is because in 6LSA, a zero label is used 
to indicate that the packet is part of a pseudoflow. 
   
The label is a part of the IPv6 header and not an extraneous, encapsulating label 
loaded on the packet.  However, the value of the label may be transferred from a 
packet Flow Label field to a label field in layer 2 such as into an MPLS label space, 
if adequate label space is available, as the packet moves from a 6LSA domain to an 
MPLS-enabled network domain or vice versa.  In the case of ATM, the label value may 
be encoded in the VPI/VCI fields to extend the label and related FEC attributes to 
the ATM layer.   
 
The label from a flow in the 6LSA thus may be transferred to a non-6LSA network layer 
or to a non-6LSA data link layer as long as there is a field available that can carry 
the 6LSA label.  The particular encoding technique and its significance must be 
agreed by both the layers - layer 3, the network layer, and layer 2, the data link 
layer.   Specifics of the method of this encoding are outside the scope of this 
document. 
 
 
6.6 
     IPv6 Label Switching Router (6LSR) 
 
A router operating in the 6LSA is an IPv6 label switching router, called 6LSR, which 
performs as a minimum the two 6LSA functions of: 1) replacing (swapping) an incoming 
label in a packet with an outgoing label, and 2) forwarding the packet based on the 
appropriate forwarding treatment.  If the packet is not to be assigned to a FEC, as 
in the case when the packet exits a 6LSA network and if it is a subsequent packet, 
the non-zero label is removed and in its place the original non-6LSA label, a zero 
value label, is inserted as needed.   
 
A 6LSR is so called in this specification because other protocols, such as the MPLS, 
identify a label switching router as an LSR which has different capabilities.  This 
helps avoid any ambiguity with the definition of LSR. 
 
A 6LSR is either an upstream 6LSR or downstream 6LSR ¡ the relationship means that 
with respect to a given label binding, a particular label represents a specific FEC 
for packets traveling out of the former into a next-hop node or 6LSR, or into the 
latter from a next-hop node or 6LSR.

6.7 
     Lead Packet 
 
A packet arriving at a 6LSA node is a lead packet if it is the first packet of the 
flow that this node has received.  A lead packet may or may not be the first packet 
of the flow that the upstream router or 6LSR forwarded to this 6LSR.  It is possible 
that the first packet in the flow is lost or misdirected, or for that matter, first 
few packets in the flow are lost or misdirected.   
 
All lead packets, whether they are the first packet from the upstream router or 6LSR 
or not, are treated like they were the first packet of the flow. 
 
Lead packet has no existing entry in the switching table of the 6LSR.  All lead 
packets have a 0 (zero) label coming into the 6LSA nodes from a best-effort network.  
When source nodes are 6LSA nodes, lead packets may carry non-zero labels.   
 
 
6.8 
     Packet Identifier (PID) Field 
 
An identifier, called Packet Identifier (PID) is a field in the switching table 
entry.  The concept of switching table is later described in this specification (see 
Section 6.9).  This field is updated whenever a packet is received by 6LSR.  The PID 
value entered is 0 (zero), if the packet is identified as a lead packet, if it is 1 
(one), the packet is a NTL or subsequent packet, that is, it is not a lead packet. 
 
 
6.9 
     Switching Table 
 
A switching table in 6SLA, often called the forwarding table in the networking 
literature, comprises the following information as they become available: 
 
  ò  Label value from the lead packet, if there is a non-zero label, otherwise a 
      zero value is entered 
  ò  Packet Identifier (PID) Field value of 0 (zero) or 1 (one) 
  ò  Incoming interface, that is, interface on which the packet arrived 
  ò  PacketÆs next hop 
  ò  Outgoing interface, that is, the interface on which the packet is forwarded to 
      the next-hop 6LSR 
  ò  FEC value that identifies the forwarding operation that needs to be performed 
      on a packet; this may include ordering and queuing of the packet prior to its 
      transmission 
 
The outgoing label entered in the switching table has to be unique so that the 6LSR 
is able to identify a unique LSP for the packet.  An exception would be when multiple 
LSPs are merged.  [This is discussed further in the following sections.] 
 
Additional information that may be available in the switching table is as follows. 
 
  ò  The data link layer and encapsulation to use 
  ò  How the label value needs to be encoded in the Flow Label field 
  ò  Timers associated with the packet  
  ò  Last packet in the flow 
  ò  Information with regard to how to discard labels or packets 
 
The format and content of the switching table entry are implementation and 
configuration specific and are not specified here.   
 
 
6.10 
      Attributes of Label Binding 
 
The binding of a label to a FEC is based on known attributes of the packet or on 
externally applied constraints.  The former may be one or more of the following: 
Traffic Class, label value, source address, destination address, TCP/UDP port number, 
RTP value, one or more extension headers, special cookie marker in the packet, or 
 
 
Chakravorty                Expires - December 2004                 [Page 11] 
draft-chakravorty-6lsa-00.txt                                August 2004 
 
 
special bit encoding in the body of the message past the protocol headers.  The 
latter may be packet-forwarding parameters selected by the network administrator 
apriori.  For instance, if an attribute is a 1 Mbps bandwidth allocation to a flow 
then this allocation is taken care of in the forwarding treatment of the packet 
identified by the binding to the proper FEC. 
 
The binding of a label to a FEC is local to a 6LSR unless such binding is promulgated 
across the network through some exterior means such as a using a label distribution 
protocol (LDP) commonly used for MPLS.  LDP is outside the scope of this document. 
 
The attributes of a label binding are configurable or encodable parameters in the 
6LSA.  The details of how the attributes are activated will be presented in a future 
traffic engineering specification. 
 
 
6.11 
      IPv6 Label Switched Path (6LSP) 
 
A label switched path in the 6LSA is called 6LSP and identifies a virtual circuit 
through which one or more flows are routed to the next-hop 6LSR.   
 
While a flow has a local, per-hop significance, a 6LSP has end-to-end, multiple-hop 
significance within the 6LSA.  A 6LSP is thus identified with a sequence of 6LSAs, 
<R1,àà,Rn> such that the following characteristics are applicable: 
 
  ò  R1, the ingress 6LSR, acquires a label and swaps it with the current label in 
      packet P unless the packet is a lead packet; 
   
  ò  For all values of i, where 1 < i < n+1, there is only one label in each IPv6 
      packet, P, and this label value is encoded in the Flow Label field of P; 
   
  ò  At no time during PÆs transit through the network of 6LSRs within a 6LSP, the 
      label value is not bound to a FEC, however, a FEC can be a best-effort delivery 
      FEC; 
   
  ò  For all i, where 1 < i < n or 1 < i < n+1, Ri transmits P to R[i+1] by using 
      the outgoing label in the packet (which is the same as the incoming label value 
      in case of the lead packet); 
   
  ò  For all i, 1 < i < n, if a system S receives and forwards P after P is 
      transmitted by Ri and before P is received by R[i+1], the forwarding decision 
      that S makes is not based on the specifications applicable to 6LSA as 
      identified in this document; such forwarding decision will imply that a layer 2 
      or other non-6LSA decision has been made outside the scope of this 
      specification; 
   
  ò  Rn, the egress 6LSR, removes the incoming label and swaps it with the original 
      label (that the ingress 6LSR received) and forwards the packet out based on the 
      next-hop address unless there is penultimate 6LSR label swapping, in which 
      case, Rn may forward the packet based on the FEC but without binding the 
      outgoing label to the FEC.   
 
The sequence of 6LSA nodes, more accurately, the sequence of node interfaces through 
which P is transported represents a 6LSP.  A 6LSP is thus represented by a label 
between any two nodes, and by one or more sequence of labels between ingress and 
egress 6LSRs, or between two or more hosts, or any combination thereof.   
Conversely, it also represents the FEC binding of each flow in each of the 6LSR on 
the 6LSP.  In this regard, 6LSP closely resembles a virtual circuit (VC) in ATM, and 
LSP in MPLS.

encoded in the Flow Label field of the outgoing packets that are not lead packets, 
out of the ingress 6LSR, A, the intermediate 6LSR, B, and removed only at the egress 
6LSRs, C, D and E when the flow of packets is from west to east.  The process is 
similar for the flows entering into the four border 6LSRs, A, C, D, and E in the 
opposite direction and for intermediate 6LSR.   
 
There can be many ingress, intermediate and egress 6LSRs in a 6LSA.   
 
Multiple 6LSPs may merge at a 6LSR if they can be identified with the same FEC and 
their outgoing route (6LSP) is the same in that they can terminate on the same next-
hop 6LSR interface.   
 
If there are no other egress routers but E, in the representative configuration shown 
in Figure 2, the flows coming on three 6LSPs represented by L1, L2, and L3 into B are 
merged and sent out on one 6LSP represented by L6.  In this case, the flows maintain 
their identity by their source and destination addresses even if their outgoing 
labels are the same on 6LSP.   
 
This is also true of the lead packet flows where labels out of A would be all of 0 
(zero) value.

Representation of 6LSPs inside a 6LSA 
Figure 2. 
 
 
Each 6LSP is maintained at least for the duration of the session of transport of all 
packets in a flow.  In 6LSA, labels may be maintained for a pre-determined time after 
a session has ceased to exist, that is, for a fixed amount of time determined apriori 
after packets belonging to a flow have ceased to arrive.   
 
A 6LSP may extend all the way to the end-system if the end-system is operating within 
the 6LSA.

    6LSA Functionalities 
 
This section provides details of 6LSA functionalities including label acquiring, 
label binding to FEC, and label swapping. 
 
 
7.1 
     Label Assignment 
 
In the 6LSA, the decision to assign or bind a label to a particular FEC is made by a 
6LSA node, generally the ingress 6LSR if it is the origination point for that flow ¡ 
in this case the flow is a pseudoflow by definition.  The host or 6LSR node then 
informs the next-hop, downstream node of this binding via the labeled IPv6 packet 
that is transmitted or via some other method depending on the nature of label 
generation and distribution methodologies.   
 
The 6LSA incorporates three models for acquiring label space.  The first model 
specifies locally generated labels; the second model refers to label distribution, 
and the third, acquires labels from the Flow Labels available in the incoming packet 
headers.  Only one of these three models of label assignment is allowed in a network 
of 6LSA-based nodes.   
 
Once a label binding is available, the 6LSA requires that the label binding be 
retained for the duration of the session.   
 
It is quite possible that multiple flows may require the same label and label binding 
to a single FEC.  In these cases, all such flows may be multiplexed together as one 
outgoing flow and forwarded on one 6LSP using the same label.  At the de-multiplexing 
6LSA node downstream, the flows must be discernible through the unique source and 
destination addresses or through other means.   
 
The 6LSA does not prevent any 6LSA node from storing any label generated at a time 
different from when it is being used nor does the 6LSA prevent a node from using any 
label that was used earlier or gotten from a flow that used an algorithm or a model 
other than those specified here.  The three models for label generation in this 
document are detailed below.

7.1.1  Locally Generated Label Model  
 
In this model, 6LSA allows a node to generate its own labels to be used in the IPv6 
header.  The specification for the algorithm(s) used to generate the 20-bit labels is 
beyond the scope of this document. An example algorithm for generating flow labels is 
a pseudorandom number generator outputting values within the parameters algorithm in 
which the bit field values are within the parameters specified in Section 6.1, Label.  
 
The Locally Generated Label model does not preclude manual generation of a label or 
range of labels through a configurator or similar other means.  The locally generated 
label may have a value related to one or more attributes that is applicable to the 
next-hop 6LSR or nodes across the network.  
 
The 6LSA specification allows labels that are locally generated but may have non-
local significance.  Such attributes may be regularly or randomly refreshed by any 
network management or other systems.  Methodologies for such refreshment are outside 
the scope of this specification.   
 
The model is not a mandatory part of 6LSA, i.e., a node is not required to implement 
the Locally Generated Label Model mechanism in order to be considered 6LSA-compliant.  
However, when a 6LSA node claims to implement the Locally Generated Label Model, the 
implementation must conform to the specification given in this document.  
 
This document encourages the use of this model because it is simple, efficient and 
avoids control plane traffic such as that present in the Distributed Label Model.  
The Locally Generated Label Model enhances security since the labels have local 
significance only and can be randomly or periodically refreshed all through the 6LSA 
domain prior to their use. 
 
7.1.2  Distributed Label Model 
 
The 6LSA allows distribution of label space generated in one or more nodes or 
externally in a server.  The architecture also allows more than one label 
distribution protocol and sharing of necessary information amongst the label 
distribution peers.  Current protocols that allow a 20-bit label distribution and do 
not violate any of this 6LSA specifications with regard to use of such labels and the 
operation of 6LSA nodes are allowed.  The specifics of label distribution protocols 
are outside the scope of this document.  
 
How label binding is distributed when applicable in the 6LSA and how a node binds a 
label to a FEC are outside the scope of this document.  The flows generated by the 
6LSA nodes using this model do not meet the definition of flow as specified in [2] 
and [3].   
 
7.1.3  Reuse Label Model 
 
The 6LSA allows a node to reuse existing label available in the node or obtained from 
labels in the incoming packets and where the flows can be associated with unique 
label bindings.   
 
This label model is not recommended for large 6LSA domains; in large domains 
undesirable duplication of labels can occur.  This model requires a single-bit field, 
the MSB field, in the label to represent the identity of the packet as the lead 
packet or non-lead packet.  It is similar to the PID value in the switching table.  
In the model, if the ôPID-representativeö bit is 0 (zero), the packet is a lead 
packet and if it is 1 (one), the packet is not a lead packet but a NTL or subsequent 
packet.  This bit assignment requires IANA registration which has not been done for 
this specification.  This bit assignment potentially reduces the number of 6LSPs 
between two peering nodes to one half of a million from a million. 
 
Details of this model remain to be developed for future specification.

7.2 
     Scope and Uniqueness of Labels 
 
A label in a packet on a 6LSP must be unique to a flow, in any given direction, 
between interfaces on peering nodes that are one hop apart.   
 
A flow always originates at the upstream source node in the 6LSA domain, continues 
through multiple 6LSRs and terminates in the destination node which also must exist 
in the 6LSA.  Such a flow must carry a non-zero label in its lead packet.   
 
A pseudoflow, on the other hand, originates at an upstream 6LSA node, which may be a 
6LSR, continues to the next-hop node and terminates there.  This next-hop node may 
also be a 6LSR.  The lead packet in a pseudoflow carries a 0 (zero) label. 
 
For the example shown in figure 3, an upstream 6LSA node, A, may bind a label L1 to 
FEC X for a flow to a downstream node, B, and B may use the same label, L1, or a 
different label (not shown) to identify a return flow Y from B to A, while at the 
same time A may bind another label L2 to FEC X for a different flow to node, C, which 
in turn may bind label L1 to FEC X for a flow to node D and label L2 to FEC X to 
another node E.

Conversely, a given upstream node, A, may bind label L to FEC F1 and then to FEC F2 
so long as these FECs represent flows to different downstream nodes, in this case, B 
and C.  See Figure 4 below.

However, two upstream nodes, A and C, may bind label L to FEC F1 and also to FEC F2 
for two different flows to the same downstream node, B, provided B is able to 
determine that the two flows are different otherwise the 6LSA requires that the 
upstream 6LSR not bind the same label to two different flows to the same next-hop 
6LSR.  See Figure 5 below, in this case the downstream 6LSR is able to determine that 
the two flows are different. What applies to two flows also applies to more than two 
flows.

         Same Label for Multiple Flows into Different Interfaces 
                                 Figure 5. 
 
 
Multiple flows from upstream 6LSRs may bind label L to multiple FECs F1, F2, F3, 
etc., for multiple flows as shown in Figure 6, or to the same FEC F for multiple 
flows.  The 6LSR B binds one label to all the outgoing flows to the downstream 6LSR 
C. This is called flow merging.  In this case, C is not able to determine on its own 
that multiple flows from B are different because they carry the same label and arrive 
on the same interface.  The differentiation is possible if the downstream 6LSR can 
identify the uniqueness of the flows through source and destination addresses, if an 
extraneous label distribution protocol such as LDP is used, or if the 6LSA locally 
distributed label model carries a specific lead packet identifier bit, such as the 
PID-representative bit as in the Reuse Label model.

7.3 
     Label Retention Mode 
 
If a 6LSR B receives a label binding from a 6LSR A for a particular FEC via an LDP, 
even though B is more than one hop apart from A, then such binding may be retained or 
discarded by B.  If the binding is retained, then this binding may be used later when 
A becomes a next hop 6LSR to B.  If the binding is discarded, then B will have to 
acquire a new binding for traffic from A through one of the three models described in 
Section 6.5.     
 
 
7.4 
     Packet Forwarding 
 
Whatever the incoming label, unless the label carries some special significance 
because of certain bit arrangement in the label or some parameters associated with 
the label that were configured apriori, the forwarding treatment of the label is of 
local significance and decided by the 6LSA node itself.  This treatment may or may 
not be the same the packet receives in any other node.  The 6LSP chosen for the 
packet is thus based on the local FEC.  The nature of the forwarding treatment and 
how it is applied is out of scope for this document.  The only exception to this rule 
may be a case when a label value is assigned globally, by policy for example. 
 
 
7.5 
     Label Stacking 
 
The 6LSA does not allow label stacking.  There is only one label in a packet and this 
label must be in the Flow Label field in the IPv6 packet header.  The 6LSA allows 
multiple label spaces per platform however the use of the label must conform to the 
specifications here in this document. 
 
 
7.6 
     Label Swapping 
 
Label swapping or switching is a process in which the incoming label in a packet is 
replaced with an outgoing label.  In this document, this process is associated with 
multiple other activities elaborated below.  These activities include matching 
switching table entries with certain incoming packet header fields, binding a label 
to the FEC, updating the switching table and forwarding the packet.  However, when 
the swapping involves only incoming label replacement with an outgoing label, it is 
called label switching, which is typically is fast process and may be carried out in 
the interface card itself. 
 
7.7 
     Packet Processing Algorithm 
 
The 6LSA packet processing algorithm includes handling packets that arrive from the 
ouside networks into the 6LSA domain or when they arrive from hosts in the same 6LSA 
domain.  The 6LSA domain processing provides QoS priority handling or such other 
treatment that the packets need. 
 
In this section, the sequence of basic steps needed for processing  a packet inside 
6LSA is detailed.

The simplest 6LSA domain consists of three nodes: the source node or ingress 6LSR, 
one destination node or egress 6LSR, and one 6LSR in between, the intermediate 6LSR.  
In the next, more complex network configuration, there are four or more nodes with 
two or more intermediate 6LSRs.   
 
The incoming flows into any of the nodes can arrive on one or more 6LSPs.  If the 
outgoing flows are merged onto the same 6LSP, the downstream node receives the merged 
flow with the same label and the flow arrives on the same interface.  Since there is 
no label stacking in 6LSA, there is no inherent advantage in flow merging.   
Packets from different flows when merged into a single flow will still have different 
source and destination addresses, and distinction between flows thus can be made by 
the source and destination addresses when the merged flow arrives at a downstream 
node.   
 
If the incoming flows arrive on different 6LSPs and thus on different interfaces, 
then flows can be distinguished by their labels and/or by incoming interfaces.  As 
the complexity grows, there may be a combination of incoming flows representing 
different LSPs ¡ merged and non-merged.  
 
In each step of packet processing, there are activities that are related to the 
components of the IPv6 header in addition to the Flow Label.  One such component is 
the Hop Limit that is incremented every time a packet passes through a node in the 
6LSA.  Additionally, if the packet has header extensions, such as Hop-by-Hop or 
Routing Header, they are processed as in the conventional IPv6 routing environment.  
Such extensions may be represented in the FEC. 
 
Recall that a 6LSA node must use only one label model at any time, for example, if it 
is using the Distributed Label Model, it must not use the Locally Generated Label 
Model. 
 
7.7.1  Packet Processing in Locally Generated Label Model 
 
The key considerations of packet processing in this model are as follows: 
 
  ò  A 6LSA domain network peers with one or more other networking domains such that 
      all packets into and out of 6LSA domains carry 0 (zero) labels. 
   
  ò  Within a 6LSA domain, a source node may generate one or more unique labels and 
      forward all packets with one, unique label for a given flow, or may forward 
      lead packet with the locally generated 0 (zero) label and the NTL and 
      subsequent packets with the unique label, the former is defined as a flow, 
      while the latter, a pseudoflow in this specification. 
   
  ò  If the lead packet from an upstream node is lost before reaching the next-hop 
      6LSR, then the NTL packet with a non-zero label will be treated by the 
      downstream 6LSR as the lead packet and forwarded with the same incoming non-
      zero label.   
   
  ò  If a lead packet with a 0 (zero) label in a flow is forwarded to a next-hop 
      6LSR different from the one to which the NTL and subsequent packets from the 
      same flow (such all packets having the same source and destination addresses) 
      are forwarded to, then two scenarios are possible.  If the lead packet shows up 
      before the NTL packet in the downstream 6LSR, then the forwarding process will 
      be as specified here.  However, if the lead packet shows up after the NTL or 
      subsequent packet, then the lead packet is processed as a lead packet while the 
      NTL packet is also processed as a lead packet but with its non-zero label.  
      Based on the flow characteristics and label bindings, the 6LSR however may 
      provide the same forwarding treatment to both flows and thus forward the 
      packets out the same interface over the same 6LSP.  If this is an egress 6LSR, 
      the outgoing label will be zero in all the packets.

  ò  If a lead packet with a non-zero label in a flow is forwarded to a next-hop 
      6LSR different from the one to which the NTL and subsequent packets from the 
      same flow (such all packets having the same source and destination addresses) 
      are forwarded to, then two scenarios are possible here as well.  If the lead 
      packet shows up before the NTL packet in the downstream 6LSR, then the 
      forwarding process will be as specified here.  However, if the lead packet 
      shows up after the NTL or subsequent packet, then the lead packet is processed 
      as an NTL or subsequent packet while the NTL packet is processed as a lead 
      packet all with the same non-zero label.  Based on the flow characteristics and 
      label bindings, the 6LSR however may provide the same forwarding treatment to 
      both the incoming flows and thus forward the packets out the same interface 
      over the same 6LSP.  If this is an egress 6LSR, the outgoing label will be zero 
      in all the packets.   
   
  ò  If there is a match for the incoming label and interface in the switching 
      table, then the incoming label is swapped with the outgoing label from the 
      switching table.  The PID value in the switching table is updated to 1 (one) if 
      it was 0 (zero).   
   
  ò  In the egress 6LSR peering with some other network router, FEC does not exist 
      since the packets are transmitted out to the other network; the packets are 
      forwarded based on the next-hop address. 
   
  ò  If packets carrying non-zero labels arrives from an external, non-6LSA domain 
      into the 6LSA domain, either erroneously or maliciously, the 6LSA domain does 
      not guarantee the forwarding of such packets with the incoming label via its 
      domain out to the same or other external domain unless the label binding is 
      available apriori to the egress 6LSR.  If this is not the case, the 6LSA domain 
      may forward the packet with a zero-label from the egress 6LSR.  This may by 
      default enhance security of the overall end-to-end networking.   
 
In the following paragraphs, the packet processing in three different types of 6LSA 
nodes is detailed for non-merging and merging flows. 
 
7.7.1.1  Packet Processing Example 
 
For an understanding of the process of label switching, a relatively simple 
configuration is used, see Figure 7 in which pseudoflows, called flows in this 
description for simplicity, originate in each of the upstream node and terminate in 
the next-hop, downstream node.

Representative packet flows and switching table entries are given in the table in 
Figure 8.  In the table, for each packet in each switching table entry column, 0 
(zero) and Ln are the label values in the top row, Sn and Dn are the source and 
destination addresses in the bottom row, and 0 (zero) and 1 (one) are the PID values 
in the middle row.  The values in the incoming, transiting and outgoing packet 
columns below indicate incoming label, and source and destination address values.  
All packets are arriving into A from a non-6LSA, best effort domain and going out of 
C into a non-6LSA and therefore all packets have 0 (zero) label.

All other packets in this flow have the same characteristics; following flows are 
similar to this flow. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
                      
                   Label Swapping for Non-Merging Flows 
                             Figure 8. 
 
The following observations represent the packet processing in Figure 8.   
 
The label in the lead packet of a flow is not swapped in any of the 6LSRs regardless 
of its label.  The PID value in the switching table is 0 (zero) for the lead packet.  
The 6LSR acquires a label, binds the lead packet label to a FEC and makes an entry in 
the 6LSR switching table for the incoming label as well as the acquired label for 
this flow, incoming interface (the physical port or link on which the packet arrived 
¡ not shown), outgoing interface (not shown), source and destination addresses, and 
the FEC (not shown).  The outgoing interface, that is, the physical port or link on 
which the packet has to be transmitted out is determined from the IPv6 routing table, 
FEC or other similar means, and entered into the switching table.  How the 6LSR 
determines the best interface for the given FEC is outside the scope of this document 
and will be specified in future work. 
 
The label in each NTL packet, as well as the label in each packet thereafter is 
swapped with an outgoing label, meaning, the incoming label is replaced with a 
unique, acquired label.  This label is the same in all outgoing packets for the same 
flow irrespective of whether the outgoing label is acquired through Locally Generated 
Label Model or through some other means.   
 
The label entry may be flagged for the way the label was acquired by the 6LSR, 
however, such flagging is outside the scope of this specification.  After the label 
is swapped, the 6LSR binds the label to the FEC and applies the forwarding treatment 
for that FEC.  The labeled packet is forwarded out of the interface that is 
determined by the applicable routing protocol. 
 
7.7.1.2  Algorithm for Non-Merging Flows 
  
The following steps describe the operations of this algorithm.  The algorithm changes 
for the 6LSA in which all nodes, that is, the source and destination nodes as well as 
all 6LSRs, exist in the 6LSA domain.  In this case, lead packets from the source node 
may carry non-zero labels.  When such packets arrive at the first 6LSR, the latter 
can determine they are lead packets, and maintains the label.  So does all other 
intermediate 6LSRs.  The last 6LSR, one hop upstream of the destination node, 
maintains this label also since the next node, the destination node is in the 6LSA 
domain. 
 
a)  Ingress 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match source and destination 
    addresses in the incoming packet with those in the switching table. 
 
  i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet; acquire an outgoing label, bind 
       the outgoing label to the pre-selected FEC for this flow, make switching 
       table entry for this packet including the labels and the PID value of 0 
       (zero), and forward the packet out; there is no swapping of incoming with the 
       outgoing label. 
   
  ii) If there is a match, and the PID value is 0 (zero) in the switching table, 
       this is an NTL packet in the flow.  Swap the incoming label with the outgoing 
       one in the switching table, set the PID to 1 (one), and forward the packet 
       out. 
   
  iii)If there is a match and the PID value is 1 (one) in the switching table, this 
       is the third or later packet, that is, a subsequent packet in the flow, 
       switch the incoming label with the outgoing label and forward the packet.

draft-chakravorty-6lsa-00.txt                                August 2004 
 
 
b)  Intermediate 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match the incoming 
    label and interface with those in the switching table. 
 
  i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet; acquire an outgoing label, bind 
       the outgoing label to the pre-selected FEC for this flow, make switching 
       table entry for this packet including the labels and the PID value of 0 
       (zero) and forward the packet out with the incoming label; there is no 
       swapping of labels. 
   
  ii) If there is a match for only the incoming label, i.e., if no outgoing label 
       exists, then this is a lead packet; acquire an outgoing label, bind the 
       outgoing label to the pre-selected FEC for this flow, make switching table 
       entry for this packet including the labels and the PID value of 0 (zero) and 
       forward the packet out; there is no swapping of labels. 
   
  iii)If there is a match, for both the label and the interface, this is an NTL or a 
       subsequent packet in this flow.  Switch the incoming label with the outgoing 
       label and forward the packet out. 
 
c)  Egress 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match the incoming label and 
    interface with those in the switching table. 
 
  i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet, look up the next-hop route and 
      make switching table entry for this packet including the label including the 
      PID value of 0 (zero) and the route for the outgoing packet, and forward the 
      packet out; there is no label binding, and there is no swapping of incoming 
      with the outgoing labels if the incoming label is 0 (zero) otherwise swap the 
      incoming label with 0 (zero) label for the peering best-effort network. 
   
  ii) If there is a match for only the incoming label and not the interface, then 
      this is a lead packet; look up the next-hop route and make switching table 
      entry for this packet including the label, the PID value of 0 (zero) and route 
      for the outgoing packet, and forward the packet out; there is no swapping of 
      labels if the incoming label is 0 (zero) otherwise swap the incoming label 
      with 0 (zero) label for the peering best-effort network. 
   
  iii)If there is a match for both the label and interface in the same entry, this 
      is an NTL or a subsequent packet in this flow; switch the incoming label with 
      0 (zero) label and forward the packet out for the peering best-effort network 
      based on the next-hop route from the switching table. 
 
7.7.1.3  Algorithm for Merging Flows 
 
Packets arriving at a downstream 6LSA node that belong to different flows but have 
the same label and arrive on the same interface are said to belong to a merged flow.  
Such packets cannot be differentiated by the downstream node without the apriori 
knowledge of how the flows were merged in the upstream 6LSR or through some other 
means. 
 
The following steps describe the operations of the algorithm when the flows out of 
the upstream 6LSR are merged and forwarded as a single flow to the next-hop 6SLR. 
 
a)  Ingress 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match source and destination 
    addresses in the incoming packet with that in the switching table.  The matching 
    by source and destination addresses identifies the uniqueness of the flow. 
 
i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet; acquire an outgoing label which is 
unique for the outgoing interface, bind the outgoing label to the pre-selected FEC 
for this flow, make switching table entry for this packet including the labels and 
the PID value of 0 (zero) for the outgoing packet and forward the packet out; there 
is no swapping of incoming with the outgoing labels.

ii)  If there is a match, and the PID value is 0 (zero) in the switching table, this 
is an NTL packet in the flow, swap the incoming label with the outgoing one in the 
switching table, increment the PID to 1 (one), and forward the packet out. 
 
iii)  If there is a match and the PID value is 1 (one) in the switching table, this a 
subsequent packet in the flow, switch the incoming label with the outgoing label and 
forward the packet out. 
 
b)  Intermediate 6LSR: when a packet arrives on an interface, match the incoming 
    label and interface with those in the switching table. 
 
i)  If there is no match, this is a lead packet; acquire an outgoing label which is 
    unique, bind the outgoing label to the pre-selected FEC for this flow, make 
    switching table entry for this packet including the labels and the PID value of 
    0 (zero) and forward the packet out and forward the packet out; there is no 
    swapping of incoming with the outgoing labels. 
 
ii) If there is a match for the incoming label and not the incoming interface, and 
    the PID value is 0 (zero) in the switching table, then this is a lead packet; 
    acquire an outgoing label, bind the outgoing label to the pre-selected FEC for 
    this flow, make switching table entry for this packet including the labels and 
    the PID value of 0 (zero) for the outgoing packet and forward the packet out; 
    there is no swapping of incoming with the outgoing labels. 
 
iii) If there is a match for both the label and the interface in the same entry, this 
    is an NTL or a subsequent packet in this flow or another flow (if the upstream

    described before for a lead packet. 
 
7.7.2  Packet Processing in Reuse Label Model 
 
Packet processing in this model is similar to that in the above packet processing 
description for the Locally Generated Label Model.  The main difference is that in 
the label, the PID-representative bit is 0 (zero) when the packet is processed as a 
lead packet and 1 (one), when the packet is processed not as a lead packet.   
 
7.7.3  Packet Processing in the Distributed Label Model 
 
Packet processing in this model is out of scope of this specification.  This if for 
future work and specification. 
 
7.8 
     Fast Switching 
 
When a 6LSR can simply swap an incoming label with an outgoing label without going 
through insertion of new entry in the switching table for that packet, then this 
swapping is termed fast switching in this specification. 
 
7.9 
     FEC Mapping 
 
Each FEC may map to a set of flows, node and route characteristics which may be 
represented in the switching table.  The switching table may consist of more than one 
entry that a particular FEC can be mapped to and forwarded via a labeled packet.   
 
7.10 
      Penultimate 6LSR Label Processing 
 
If the label in a non-lead packet is acquired through the Locally Generated Label 
model and not through other means and applied to a packet in the 6LSR upstream of the 
penultimate 6LSR, the latter being the 6LSR one hop upstream of the egress 6LSR, the 
penultimate 6LSR may decide to not bind the label to the FEC for this flow but simply 
insert it in the packet and forward the packet out since the next hop is not affected 
by the absence of any prior label binding.  The egress 6LSR forwards the packet out 
based on the outgoing route.  This saves processing related to binding at a minimum. 
 
7.11 
    Invalid Incoming Labels 
 
An incoming or acquired label is invalid if it has a value that does not allow the 
6LSA node to bind the label to a FEC.  Such a label may be discarded after the lead 
packet is forwarded in a pseudoflow.  Invalid labels may not include a zero-labeled 
packet. 
 
7.11.1  LSP Control: Ordered and Loose 
 
As described in the MPLS label switching architecture [1], some FECs correspond to 
address prefixes which are available from dynamic routing algorithm running in a 
node.  There are two methods in 6LSA for setting up LSPs for these FECs: Ordered and 
Loose.  The control of LSP is a local function at a 6LSA node.  In 6LSA, each FEC is 
identified with a set of attributes.   
 
If the traffic in a particular FEC has to follow the same path that has a specified 
set of attributes such as bandwidth and other resources (QoS parameters) etc., then 
ordered control must be used.  How this ordered control is initiated and maintained 
is out of the scope of this document.  This is for further work and documentation. 
 
In the loose control, a 6LSR after binding a label to a FEC, distributes that binding 
to its label distribution peers more like the routing algorithms.   
 
Ordered control and loose control are fully interoperable.

7.12 
      Aggregation 
 
The 6LSA allows aggregation of labels when FECs represent address prefixes.  Since 
IPv6 address prefixes are ôaggregatableö, aggregation of FECs corresponding to 
aggregatable prefixes is allowed in the 6LSA.  The extent of aggregation is a 
function of the address aggregation, granularity of service desired or both.  Such 
aggregation may further be decided by the IPv6 packet header Traffic Class 
parameters. 
 
7.13 
      Route Selection  
 
The method of selecting the proper 6LSP for a particular FEC is called route 
selection in the 6LSA and the options the 6LSA allows are (1) hop-by-hop routing, and 
(2) explicit routing.   
 
The hop-by-hop option has been described above in Section 7.7 in which each node in 
the 6LSA independently selects the next hop based on a given FEC.  This is very 
similar to the ôbest-effortö routing except that the forwarding in this mode of 6LSA 
is FEC driven.  
 
7.13.1  Hop-by-Hop Routing using Hop-by-Hop Header Extension 
 
To ensure per hop 6LSP execution, the 6LSA allows use of Hop-by-Hop Options header, 
identified by a Next Header value of 0 (zero) in the IPv6 header.  This increases 
processing at each node since the packet carries optional information that needs 
processing by every 6LSR along a packetÆs route. 
 
7.13.2  Explicit Routing using Routing Header Extension  
 
To ensure explicit routing of packets, the 6LSA allows use of IPv6 Routing Header 
extensions.  The Next Header value of 43 is then an attribute that a given FEC must 
include.  In this case, the label binding to the FEC represents explicit routing 
using the Next Header value.  The forwarding treatment a packet gets in a 6LSR 
comprises transmitting the packet to the next-hop 6LSR identified in the destination 
address field of the packet.  The final destination of the packet in an explicitly 
routed packet may be outside of the 6LSA domain.  
 
7.14 
      Control 
 
The 6LSA specification requires the Hop Limit value in the packet header be 
decremented by 1 (one) in each 6LSR.  The 6LSA processing of Hop Limit remains the 
same as in conventional IPv6 packet processing. 
 
7.15 
      Label Encodings  
 
The 6LSA allows encoding of the label value in layer 2 protocols such as in ATM 
packetÆs VPI/VCI fields.  Since only one label is used and that each such label is 
uniquely identifiable in the 6LSA, encoding the label in the ATM VPI/VCI field is 
feasible.  Considerations with respect to how flows are identified, the FEC-based 
forwarding treatment and flow merging issues need careful planning in layer 2 label 
encoding.   
 
How a 6LSA label value is encoded in the ATM VPI/VCI field is outside the scope of 
this document.    
7.16 
      Anycast in 6LSA  
 
IPv6 defines the anycast address like a regular unicast address with a prefix 
specifying the subnet and an identifier that is set to all zeroes.  Anycast packets 
delivered to this address are delivered to one router in that subnet.  There are 
reserved subnet anycast addresses such as for mobile IPv6 Home-Agents anycast.  The 
6LSA allows the use of anycast addressing.  Whenever a 6LSR is a node in any anycast 
subnet, such a subnet may be a 6LSA, a subset of 6LSA or some other part of 6LSA.  
When an anycast packet arrives in anycast subnet 6LSR where the subnet is a part or

whole of 6SLA, the 6LSR binds the packet to a FEC which has anycast routing as part 
of the forwarding treatment attributes of the FEC.  The packet is thus forwarded to a 
next-hop 6LSR through an interface determined by the FEC attributes related to 
anycast forwarding. 
 
7.17 
      Multicast in 6LSA 
 
IPv6 defines the mutlicast address by the high-order octet FF or 11111111 in binary 
notation and 4 bits for the scope of the multicast and an identifier bit that 
indicates whether the multicast address belongs to a well-known IANA multicast 
address group or is a temporary address.   
 
The 6LSA allows the use mutlicast addressing.  Whenever a 6LSR is a node in any 
mutlicast tree, such a tree may be a 6LSA, a subset of 6LSA or a part of 6LSA.  When 
a mutlicast packet arrives in a multicast tree 6LSR where the subnet is a part or 
whole of 6SLA, the 6LSR binds the packet to a FEC which has mutlicast routing as part 
of the forwarding treatment attributes of the FEC.  The packet is thus forwarded to a 
next-hop 6LSR through an interface determined by the FEC attributes related to 
mutlicast forwarding. 
 
8. 
    Security Considerations 
 
The 6SLA allows security association.  If the security association (SA) partners are 
outside the 6SLA, then there is no effect on the 6SLA by the SA whether the mode of 
operation is in the transport mode or in the tunnel mode.   
 
In the transport mode of SA, only the packet payload is subject to encryption or 
authentication, so the IPv6 packet header features are not affected and the 6LSA 
being a transport mechanism that sets up 6LSPs and provides specific FEC-driven 
forwarding treatment, there is no impact on the 6LSA or impact on SA operation by the 
6SLA. 
 
In the tunnel mode of SA, the SA requires an outer wrapper IPv6 packet.  The sending 
gateway wraps the whole IPv6 packet including the content.  The receiving gateway 
performs the checksum on the outer wrapper packet, unwraps the packet and then 
verifies the checksum of the inner packet through end-to-end SA.  If the outer 
wrapper packet conveys the Flow Label value of the inner packet, then 6SLA provides 
the 6LSP transport based on the inner label value, otherwise the transport indicates 
the outer label value.  Here also, there is no impact on the 6LSA based transport of 
the secure packets or vice versa. 
 
The Authentication Header (AH) is used in IPv6 for authentication of individual 
packets to prevent common Internet-based attacks such as IP address spoofing and 
session hijacking.  The computation of cryptographically secure checksum over the 
payload as well as some fields of the IPv6 and extension headers has to take place 
between the SA partners.  This computation does not include the Flow Label field in 
the packet header.  This maintains label transparency in the 6SLA.  Authentication 
can be either in the transport mode or in the tunnel mode. 
 
The 6SLA security considerations that apply to Encrypted Security Payload (ESP) 
header comprise encryption modes that are categorized as transport mode or tunnel 
mode.  In the transport mode, no encryption of the Flow Label field is performed, so 
the value is carried through the 6SLA.  In the tunnel mode, the issues are the same 
as stated here above.
