    OSPF-Traffic Engineering Link Availability Extension for Links with 
                        Variable Discrete Bandwidth 
            draft-ietf-ccamp-ospf-availability-extension-13.txt 


Abstract 

   A network may contain links with variable discrete bandwidth, e.g., 
   copper, radio, etc. The bandwidth of such links may change 
   discretely in reaction to changing external environment. 
   Availability is typically used for describing such links during 
   network planning. This document defines a new type of the 
   Generalized Switching Capability-specific information (SCSI) TLV to 
   extend the Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Open 
   Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol. The extension can be 
   used for route computation in a network that contains links with 
   variable discrete bandwidth. Note, this document only covers the 
   mechanisms by which the availability information is distributed. The 
   mechanisms by which availability information of a link is determined 
   and the use of the distributed information for route computation are 
   outside the scope of this document. It is intended that technology-
   specific documents will reference this document to describe specific 
   uses.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED","MAY", and

1. Introduction 

   Some data plane technologies, e.g., microwave, and copper,   allow 
   seamless change of maximum physical bandwidth through a set of known 
   discrete values. The parameter, availability, as described in 
   [G.827], [F.1703] and [P.530] is often used to describe the link 
   capacity. The availability is a time scale, representing a proportion 
   of the operating time that the requested bandwidth is ensured. To 
   set up an LSP across these links, availability information is 
   required by the nodes to verify the bandwidth before making a 
   bandwidth reservation.  Assigning different availability classes 
   over such links provides for a more efficient planning of link 
   capacity to support different types of services. The link 
   availability information will be determined by the operator and 
   statically configured. It will usually be determined from the 
   availability requirements of the services expected to be carried on 
   the LSP. For example, voice service usually needs "five nines" 
   availability, while non-real time services may adequately perform at 
   four or three nines availability. For the route computation, both 
   the availability information and the bandwidth resource information 
   are needed. Since different service types may need different 
   availability guarantees, multiple <availability, bandwidth> pairs 
   may be required to be associated with a link.  

   In this document, a new type of the Generalized SCSI TLV, 
   Availability TLV is defined. It is intended that technology-specific 
   documents will reference this document to describe specific uses. 
   The signaling extension to support links with discrete bandwidth is 
   defined in [I-D. ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-bandwidth-availability].

3. Overview 

   A node which has link(s) with variable bandwidth attached should 
   include < availability, bandwidth> information list in its OSPF 
   Traffic Engineering (TE) LSA messages. The list provides the mapping 
   between the link nominal bandwidth and its availability level. This 
   information is used for path calculation by the node(s). The setup 
   of a Label Switched Path requires this information to be flooded in 
   the network and used by the nodes or the PCE for the path 
   computation. In this document, a new type of the Generalized SCSI 
   TLV, Availability TLV is defined. The computed path can then be 
   provisioned via the signaling protocol [I-D. ietf-ccamp-rsvp-te-
   bandwidth-availability]. 

   Note, the mechanisms described in this document only distribute 
   availability information. The methods for measuring the information 
   or using the information for route computation are outside the scope 
   of this document. 

4. TE Metric Extension to OSPF-TE 

4.1. Availability SCSI-TLV 

   The Generalized SCSI is defined in [RFC8258]. The Availability TLV 
   defined in this document is a new type of Generalized SCSI-TLV. The

Internet-Draft    Availability extension to OSPF-TE      December 2017 
    

   Availability SCSI-TLV can be included for one or more times. The 
   Availability SCSI-TLV has the following format: 

       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |               Type            |               Length          | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
      |                   Availability level                          |

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   Type: 0x0001, 16 bits. 

   Length: 2 octets, 16 bits. 

   Availability level: 32 bits 

   This field is a binary32-format floating point number as defined by 
   [IEEE754-2008]. The bytes are transmitted in network order; that is, 
   the byte containing the sign bit is transmitted first. This field 
   describes the decimal value of availability guarantee of the 
   switching capability in the Interface Switching Capability 
   Descriptor (ISCD) [RFC4202] object. The value MUST be less than 1. 
   The Availability level is usually expressed in the value of 
   0.99/0.999/0.9999/0.99999. 

   LSP Bandwidth at Availability level n: 32 bits 

   This field is a 32-bit IEEE floating point number as defined by 
   [IEEE754-2008]. The bytes are transmitted in network order; that is, 
   the byte containing the sign bit is transmitted first. This field 
   describes the LSP Bandwidth for the Availability level represented 
   in the Availability field. The units are bytes per second.  

4.2. Processing Procedures  

   The ISCD allows routing protocols such as OSPF to carry technology 
   specific information in the Switching Capability-specific 
   information (SCSI) field, see [RFC4203]. A node advertising an 
   interface with a Switching Capability which supports variable 
   bandwidth attached SHOULD contain one or more Availability SCSI-TLVs 
   in its OSPF TE LSA messages. Each Availability SCSI-TLV provides the 
   information about how much bandwidth a link can support for a 

 
 
Long, et al.            Expires June 5, 2018                  [Page 5] 

Internet-Draft    Availability extension to OSPF-TE      December 2017 
    

   specified availability. This information may be used for path 
   calculation by the node(s). 

   The Availability SCSI-TLV MUST NOT be sent in ISCDs with Switching 
   Capability field values that have not been defined to support the 
   Availability SCSI-TLV. Non-supporting nodes would see such as a 
   malformed ISCD/LSA. 

   Absence of the Availability SCSI-TLV in an ISCD containing Switching 
   Capability field values that have been defined to support the 
   Availability SCSI-TLV, SHALL be interpreted as representing fixed-
   bandwidth link with the highest availability value.  

   Only one Availability SCSI-TLV for the specific availability level 
   SHOULD be sent. If multiple are present, the Availability SCSI-TLV 
   with the lowest bandwidth value SHALL be processed. If an 
   Availability SCSI-TLV with an invalid value (e.g., large than 1) is 
   received, the Availability SCSI-TLV will be ignored.  

5. Security Considerations 

   This document specifies the contents of Opaque LSAs in OSPFv2. 
   Tampering with GMPLS TE LSAs may have an effect on traffic 
   engineering computations.  [RFC3630] suggests mechanisms such as 
   [RFC2154] to protect the transmission of this information, and those 
   or other mechanisms should be used to secure and/or authenticate the 
   information carried in the Opaque LSAs. An analysis of the security 
   of OSPF is provided in [RFC6863] and applies to the extensions to 
   OSPF as described in this document.  Any new mechanisms developed to 
   protect the transmission of information carried in Opaque LSAs will 
   also automatically protect the extensions defined in this document. 

   Please refer to [RFC5920] for details on security threats; defensive 
   techniques; monitoring, detection, and reporting of security 
   attacks; and requirements. 

6. IANA Considerations 

   This document introduces a new type for availability of the 
   Generalized SCSI-TLV of the TE Link TLV in the TE Opaque LSA for 
   OSPF v2. Technology-specific documents will reference this document 
   to describe specific use of this Availability SCSI-TLV.  

   IANA has created a registry called the "Generalized SCSI (Switching 
   Capability Specific Information) TLVs Types" registry. The registry

Internet-Draft    Availability extension to OSPF-TE      December 2017 
    

   is needed to be updated to include the Availability SCSI-TLV. This 
   document proposes a suggested value for the Availability SCSI-TLV; 
   it is requested that the suggested value be granted by IANA.  

   Note (Please REMOVE this note before publication): the registry will 
   be created by [RFC8258]. The requested value should be added to it 
   when it is created.
