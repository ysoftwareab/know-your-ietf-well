Abstract 
    
   For scalability purposes a network may comprise multiple IGP areas. 
   An inter-area TE-LSP is an LSP that transits through at least two IGP 
   areas. In a multi-area network, topology visibility remains local to 
   a given area, and a head-end LSR cannot compute alone an inter-area 
   shortest constrained path. One key application of the Path 
   Computation Element (PCE) based architecture is the computation of 
   inter-area TE-LSP paths. This document lists a detailed set of PCE 
   Communication Protocol (PCECP) specific requirements for support of 
   inter-area TE-LSP path computation. It complements generic 
   requirements for a PCE Communication Protocol.

3. Introduction 
 
   [RFC4105] lists a set of motivations and requirements for setting up 
   TE-LSPs across IGP area boundaries. These LSPs are called inter-area 
   TE-LSPs. These requirements include the computation of inter- 
   area shortest constrained paths with key guideline being to respect 
   the IGP hierarchy concept, and particularly the containment of 
   topology information. The main challenge with inter-area MPLS-TE

   relies actually on path computation. Indeed the head-end LSR cannot 
   compute a constrained path across areas, as its topology visibility 
   is limited to its own area.  
 
   Inter-area path computation is one of the key applications of the PCE 
   based architecture [PCE-ARCH]. The computation of optimal inter-area 
   paths may be achieved using the services of one or more PCEs.  
   Such PCE-based inter-area path computation could rely for instance on 
   a single multi-area PCE that has the TE database of all the areas in 
   the IGP domain and can directly compute an end-to-end constrained 
   shortest path.  Alternatively, this could rely on the cooperation 
   between PCEs whereby each PCE covers one or more IGP areas and the 
   full set of PCEs covers all areas. 
 
   The generic requirements for a PCE Communication Protocol (PCECP), 
   which allows a PCC to send path computation requests to a PCE and the 
   PCE to sent path computation responses to a PCC, are set forth in 
   [PCE-COM-REQ]. The use of a PCE-based approach for inter-area path 
   computation implies specific requirements on a PCE Communication 
   Protocol, in addition to the generic requirements already listed in 
   [PCE-COM-REQ]. This document complements these generic requirements 
   by listing a detailed set of PCECP requirements specific to inter-
   area path computation.  
 
   It is expected that a solution for a PCECP satisfies these 
   requirements.  
    
   Note that PCE-based inter-area path computation may require a 
   mechanism for an automatic PCE discovery across areas, which is out 
   of the scope of this document. Detailed requirements for such a 
   mechanism are discussed in [PCE-DISCO-REQ]. 
 
4. Motivations for PCE-based Inter-Area Path Computation 
    
   IGP hierarchy allows improving IGP scalability, by dividing the IGP 
   domain into areas and limiting the flooding scope of topology 
   information to area boundaries. A router in an area has full topology 
   information for its own area but only reachability to destinations in 
   other areas._ Thus, a head-end LSR cannot compute an end-to-end 
   constrained path that traverses more than one IGP area.  
    
   A solution for computing inter-area TE-LSP path currently relies on a 
   per domain path computation ([PD-COMP]). It is based on loose hop 
   routing with an ERO expansion on each ABR. This can allow setting up 
   a constrained path, but faces two major limitations:  
   - This does not allow computing an optimal constrained path; 
   - This may lead to several crankback signaling messages and  
     hence delay the LSP setup, and also invoke possible alternate  
     routing activities. 
    
   Note that, here, by optimal constrained path we mean the shortest 
   constrained path across multiple areas, taking into account either

   the IGP or TE metric [METRIC]. In other words, such a path is the 
   path that would have been computed by making use of some CSPF 
   algorithm in the absence of multiple IGP areas.  
    
   The PCE based architecture [PCE-ARCH] is well suited to inter-area 
   path computation, as it allows overcoming the path computation 
   limitations resulting from the limited topology visibility, by 
   introducing path computation entities with more topology visibility, 
   or by allowing cooperation between path computation entities in each 
   area. 
    
   There are two main approaches for the computation of an inter-area 
   optimal path: 
   - Single PCE computation: The path is computed by a single PCE that  
     has topology visibility in all areas and can alone compute an end- 
     to-end optimal constrained path. 
   - Multiple PCE computation with inter-PCE communication: the path  
     computation is distributed on multiple PCEs, which have partial  
     topology visibility. They compute path segments in their areas of  
     visibility and collaborate with each other so as to arrive at an  
     end-to-end optimal constrained path. Such collaboration is ensured   
     thanks to inter-PCE communication. 
    
   Note that the use of a PCE-based approach, to perform inter-area path 
   computation implies specific functional requirements in a PCECP, in 
   addition to the generic requirements listed in [PCE-COM-REQ]. These 
   specific requirements are discussed in next section. 
 
 
5. Detailed Inter-Area Specific Requirements on PCECP 
 
   This section lists a set of additional requirements for the PCECP 
   that complement requirements listed in [PCE-COM-REQ] and are specific 
   to inter-area (G)MPLS TE path computation. 
    
5.1. Control of area crossing 
    
   In addition to the path constraints specified in [PCE-COM-REQ], the 
   request message MUST allow indicating whether area crossing is 
   allowed or not.  
   Indeed, when the source and destination reside in the same IGP area, 
   there may be intra-area and inter-area feasible paths. As set forth 
   in [RFC4105], if the shortest path is an inter-area path, an operator 
   either may want to avoid, as far as possible, crossing areas and thus 
   may prefer selecting a sub-optimal intra-area path or, conversely, 
   may prefer to use a shortest path, even if it crosses areas.   
    
   Also, when the source and destinations reside in the same area it may 
   be useful to know whether the returned path is an inter-area path. 
   Hence the response message MUST allow indicating whether the computed 
   path is crossing areas.

Internet Draft draft-ietf-pce-pcecp-interarea-reqs-02.txt    July 2006 


5.2. Area Recording 
     
   It may be useful for the PCC to know the set of areas crossed by an 
   inter-area path and the corresponding path segments. Hence the 
   response message MUST support the inclusion of the identifiers of the 
   crossed areas and MUST allow identifying the corresponding path 
   segments. 
 
5.3. Strict Explicit Path and Loose Path 
    
   A Strict Explicit Path is defined as a set of strict hops, while a 
   Loose Path is defined as a set of at least one loose hop and zero, 
   one ore more strict hops. An inter-area path may be strictly explicit 
   or loose (e.g. a list of ABRs as loose hops). It may be useful to 
   indicate to the PCE if a Strict Explicit path is required or not. 
   Hence the PCECP request message MUST allow indicating whether a 
   Strict Explicit Path is required/desired. 
 
5.4. PCE-list Enforcement and Recording in Multiple PCE Computation 
 
   In case of multiple-PCE inter-area path computation, a PCC may want 
   to indicate a preferred list of PCEs to be used. Hence the PCECP 
   request message MUST support the inclusion of a list of preferred 
   PCEs. Note that this requires that a PCC in one area have knowledge 
   of PCEs in other areas. This could rely on configuration or on a PCE 
   discovery mechanism, allowing discovery across area boundaries (see 
   [PCE-DISCO-REQ]). 
    
   Also it would be useful to know the list of PCEs which effectively 
   participated in the computation. Hence the request message MUST 
   support a request for PCE recording and the response message MUST 
   support the recording of the set of one or more PCEs that took part 
   in the computation. 
   It may also be useful to know the path segments computed by each PCE. 
   Hence the request message SHOULD allow a request for the 
   identification of path segments computed by a PCE, and the response 
   message SHOULD allow identifying the path segments computed by each 
   PCE. 
 
5.5. Inclusion of Area IDs in Request 
    
   The knowledge of the areas in which the source and destination lie 
   would allow selection of appropriate cooperating PCEs. A PCE may not 
   be able to determine the location of the source and destination and 
   in such a case it would be useful that a PCC indicates the source and 
   destination area IDs.  
   For that purpose the request message MUST support the inclusion of  
   the source and destination area IDs. Note that this information could  
   be learned by the PCC through configuration.

5.6. Inter-area Diverse Path computation 
    
   For various reasons, including protection and load balancing, the 
   computation of diverse inter-area paths may be required.  
   There are various levels of diversity in an inter-area context:  
        -Per-area diversity (intra-area path segments are link, node or  
         SRLG disjoint) 
        -Inter-area diversity (end-to-end inter-area paths are link,  
         node or SRLG disjoint) 
    
   Note that two paths may be disjoint in the backbone area but non-
   disjoint in peripheral areas. Also two paths may be node disjoint 
   within areas but may share ABRs, in which case path segments within 
   an area are node disjoint but end-to-end paths are not node-disjoint. 
 
   The request message MUST allow requesting the computation of a set of 
   inter-area diverse paths between the same node pair or between 
   distinct node pairs. It MUST allow indicating the required level of 
   intra-area diversity (link, node, SRLG) on a per area basis, as well 
   as the level of inter-area diversity (shared ABRs or ABR 
   disjointness). 
    
   The response message MUST allow indicating the level of diversity of 
   a set of computed loose paths. 
 
   Note that specific objective functions may be requested for diverse 
   path computation, such as minimizing the cumulated cost of a set of 
   diverse paths as set forth in [PCE-COM-REQ]. 
    
5.7. Inter-area Policies 
    
   In addition to the policy requirements discussed in [PCE-COM-REQ], 
   the application of inter-area path computation policies requires some 
   additional information to be carried in the PCECP request messages: 
    
    - The request message MUST allow for the inclusion of the address of   
      the originating PCC. This may be useful in a multiple PCE  
      computation, so as to apply policies not only based on the PCECP  
      peer but also based on the originating PCC; 
    
   - The request message MUST allow indicating whether area/AS crossing    
      is allowed or not.  
    
   Note that work on supported policy models and the corresponding 
   requirements/implications is being undertaken as a separate work item 
   in the PCE working group ([PCE-POL-FMWK]).

6. Manageability Considerations 
    
   The inter-area application does not imply new manageability 
   requirements beyond those already defined in [PCE-COM-REQ]. 
 
7. Security Considerations 
    
   IGP areas are administrated by the same entity. Hence the inter-area 
   application does not imply a new trust model, or new security issues 
   beyond those already defined in [PCE-COM-REQ].
