 1.     Overview  
         
    This document provides an applicability statement for the transport 
    of TDM circuits over PSN. The document describes the various 
    deployment scenarios and the recommended encapsulations and 
    services to be used. In particular, it describes the scenarios 
    applicable for SONET/SDH derived circuit emulation and scenarios 
    applicable for native TDM emulation.  
     
    SONET/SDH SPE circuit emulation is described in [CEP-SPE].  
    Extension of SONET/SDH emulation for SONET VT1.5/2/3/6 and SDH VC-
    11/12/2 circuits is described in [CEP-VT]. This draft also 
    describes bandwidth saving modes for SONET STS-1 and SDH VC-3/4 
    circuits carrying tributaries or asynchronous E3/T3 signals.  
    Native TDM circuit emulation for unstructured T1/E1/T3/E3 and 
    structured N*DS0 circuit emulation is described in [CESoPSN]. The 
    native encapsulation also supports generic mechanism for carrying 
    CE application state signaling. 
    All proposals support the same set of PSN encapsulations, 
    multiplexing techniques and share a common control word, differing 
    only in payload. The proposals and the applicability statement all 
    follow the PWE3 framework [PWE3-FW] and requirements [PWE3-REQ] as

    well as the protocol layering architectural document [PWE3-LAYERS] 
    and the design guidelines of the architectual principals of the 
    Internet document [RFC1958]. In particular, the principle of 
    minimum intervention that states the payload should, where 
    possible, be transported as received without modification is 
    followed. 
     
     
 2.     Fidelity of Emulated TDM Services  
     
    Emulated TDM services may differ from the alternative to carry them 
    as native TDM services end to end on the following parameters: 
    timing, service reliability, end-to-end delay, and bit-error-rate. 
    Each of these parameters is discussed below. 
     
 2.1      Timing 
     
    The most predominant differentiator between emulation of TDM 
    services and emulation of layer-2 services is the need to stand 
    within the stringent timing and synchronization standards [G.823], 
    [G.824] and [T1.101]. The requirements on the clock accuracy, 
    jitter and wander are tighter for the higher rate services.  
     
    All protocols allow carrying an emulated signal and the timing of 
    the emulated signal, independent of the provider network timing 
    scheme and source.  
     
    All protocols do not presume availability of a common synchronous 
    clock at the ends of a PW (i.e. at the PEs). However, the fidelity 
    of the recovered TDM timing in this case will be dependent on the 
    packet-delay variation behavior of the underlying PSN and the 
    robustness of the timing recovery algorithm used. 
     
    In all protocols, it is possible to decouple the timing quality of 
    the emulated signal from the PSN characteristics by providing a 
    synchronized clock to both PEs. The required quality of this 
    synchronization depends on the emulated signal requirements and 
    application, and is beyond the scope of this document. 
     
    Given the rigorous synchronization requirements implied by 
    emulating core SONET/SDH circuits, it is expected that SONET/SDH 
    SPE emulation [CES-SPE] will frequently be deployed in situations 
    where a common timing reference is available at the PW end-points.   
     
    It is expected that in point to point PDH circuit emulation and in 
    PDH to SONET/SDH emulation scenarios common timing reference will 
    not be available at the PW end points.

 2.2      Service Reliability 
         
    Service Reliability may be impacted by two components: the 
    robustness of the underlying PSN and whether specific steps have 
    been taken to protect the emulated service (such as 1+1 protection 
    switching on the emulated service).  The PE's de-jitter buffer and 
    packet reordering mechanisms reduce the impact of fast PSN 
    rerouting events on the emulated service. In the case of a failure, 
    fast protection mechanism in the PSN can guarantee performance   
    similar to that of the equivalent recovery mechanisms in the native 
    TDM network. 
     
    Occasional loss of a single packet does not result in losing more 
    information than carried in this packet, since all the protocols 
    allow independent play out of each packet, as recommended in 
    [RFC2736]. 
     
 2.3      End to End Delay 
         
    The end-to-end delay will be impacted by the packetization delay, 
    the transit delay through the PSN and the packet-delay-variation 
    characteristics of the PSN, as the latter define the minimum de-
    jitter buffer length and therefore the incremental delay caused by 
    the de-jitter buffer operation. The protocol makes no assumption 
    regarding the delay and delay variation introduced by the PSN.  
    However, the tighter the bound on transit delay and delay 
    variation, the shorter the end-to-end delay of the emulated circuit 
    will be.  
     
    The packetization delay within all payload formats is constant for 
    the duration of the PW and configurable at set up time. The payload 
    formats differ in the maximal configurable packetization delay. 
    Longer packetization delay adds to the total delay but increase the 
    bandwidth efficiency. 
    Native emulation [CESoPSN] has no restriction on the maximal 
    packetization delay. SPE based SONET/SDH emulation [CEP-SPE] 
    restricts the packetization delay to 0.125 ms equivalent to a 
    single SPE frame. VT based SONET/SDH emulation [CEP-VT] restricts 
    the packetization delay to 0.5 ms equivalent to 4 T1/E1 frames. 
     
    Echo cancellers may be required when one-way end to end delay 
    exceeds 25 ms [G.131].  
     
 2.4      Error Rate 
         
    BER will be dependent on the characteristics of the PSN. A BER on a 
    physical link in the PSN is translated in current PSN links to a 
    packet drop. Congestion may also lead to packet drop. Packets 
    arriving too late for the de-jitter buffer depth are effectively 
  
  
                        Expires - December 2002               [Page 4] 
                 TDM emulation applicability statement       June 2002 
  
  
    dropped. Each such packet drop event will result in a number of 
    byte errors equivalent to packet length on the emulated signal. The 
    use of shorter packet lengths can minimize the effect at the cost 
    of additional total overhead. All payload formats allow packet 
    length flexibility. New transport technologies enable forwarding 
    PSN packets for selected services even when there is BER on the 
    physical links. This will enable in the future better BER 
    performance of the emulated service. 
     
     
 3.     Fault Isolation and Performance Monitoring 
     
    The protocol allows collection of PDH and SONET/SDH-like faults and 
    performance monitoring parameters.  Similarity with existing PDH 
    and SONET/SDH services is increased by the protocol's ability to 
    carry 'far end error' indications (i.e. RDI).  The protocol 
    performance monitoring capabilities are based on PDH and SONET/SDH 
    requirements as reflected by the available standards, and adapted 
    to the nature of the protocol.  
         
    The protocol provides the ability to detect lost packets and hence 
    allows it to distinguish between PSN problems and problems external 
    to the PSN as causes of outages and/or degradations of the emulated 
    service.  In addition, the protocol supports fast detection of 
    defects, enabling deployment of rapid fault recovery mechanisms for 
    the emulated circuit.  
         
 4.     PSN Considerations  
     
    Limitation on Path MTU, bandwidth considerations and congestion 
    control implications are discussed below. 
     
 4.1      Path MTU 
     
    Some assumptions on path MTU are made. The assumptions are as 
    follows: 
     
    Path MTU between a pair of PEs SHOULD allow carrying CEP payload of 
    783 bytes for SONET/SDH circuit emulation defined in [CEP-SPE] and 
    for fractional STS-1/VC-3/VC-4 defined in [CEP-VT]. 
     
    Path MTU between a pair of PEs MUST allow carrying payload of 537 
    bytes (for unstructured E3) and 699 bytes (for unstructured T3) 
    [CESoPSN]. 
     
    While these requirements exceed the minimal IP path MTU defined in 
    [RFC1122], they are easily met in most modern core packet-switching 
    networks.

 4.2      Bandwidth Effectiveness 
  
    The protocol allows for bandwidth conservation in the PSN by 
    carrying only AIS and/or unequipped/Idle indications instead of 
    empty payloads.  
     
    Payload compression of SONET/SDH STS-1/VC-3/VC-4 circuits carrying 
    tributaries and SONET/SDH STS-1/VC-3 carrying asynchronous DS-3/E3 
    PDH signals is defined in [CEP-VT]. The first method provides the 
    ability to carry any number of tributaries 1-28 within a SONET STS-
    1 emulated circuit and 1-84 tributaries for an SDH VC-4 emulated 
    circuit omitting unequipped or unswitched tributaries. The second 
    method drops the fixed columns within the STS-1/VC-3 asynchronous 
    DS-3/E3 emulated circuit providing up to 28% bandwidth saving. 
     
    [CESoPSN] N*DS0 structured service provides bandwidth efficient 
    encapsulation for Fractional T1/E1 applications, carrying only the 
    relevant DS0 across the PSN. 
             
    Longer packetization delay increases the bandwidth effectiveness 
    but adds to the total end to end delay and to the cost of packet 
    loss (BER). The tradeoffs and limitations on the maximal 
    packetization delay are discussed in a previous section.  
     
    In addition to the encapsulation overhead, each protocol adds PSN 
    specific overhead and control word and RTP header. In some 
    scenarios, and depending on the protocol, the RTP header may be 
    compressed. Specifically, in [CEP-VT]and [CEP-SPE] the RTP overhead 
    may be compressed independent of the timing mode used. 
     
 4.3      Congestion   
     
    Being a constant bit rate (CBR) service, the protocol cannot 
    provide TCP-friendly behavior under network congestion.  It will 
    operate best in environments where the Diff-Serv EF PHB with 
    allocated bandwidth is available end-to-end between the PW 
    endpoints and the EF bandwidth is sized to meet the requirements of 
    the emulated TDM circuits, or over a well engineered path as 
    available through the relevant signaling protocols like RSVP-TE and 
    CR-LDP for MPLS PSNs.  Using these methods will prevent contention 
    between the TDM Emulation protocol and TCP traffic.  Unusable 
    service characteristics from the packet switched network may be 
    used to trigger circuit/PW teardown or switch-over.  
     
        
 5.     Deployment Scenarios  
         
    This section describes the various TDM emulation deployment 
    scenarios and recommends the best encapsulation type for each. In

                 TDM emulation applicability statement       June 2002 
  
  
    deployment scenarios where more then one option exists, the 
    considerations for selecting one of the recommended options are 
    indicated. The considerations include (not in order of importance) 
    simplicity, flexibility, bandwidth utilization, operation and 
    maintenance features, and the services expected by deployment of 
    (non-emulated) circuits in similar environments.  
     
     
 5.1      Point to Point PDH Emulation 
     
    Point to Point PDH emulation deployment scenario refers to 
    scenarios where a structured or unstructured PDH circuit is 
    emulated across the PSN. The lists of services are: 
     
      1. Structured services:  
          a. N*DS0, 1 <= N <= 31 as described in [G.704].  
           
      2. Unstructured services  
          a. Unstructured E1 as described in [G.704][G.703]  
          b. Unstructured T1 (DS1) as described in [T.157a]  
          c. Unstructured E3 as defined in [G.751]  
          d. Unstructured T3 (DS3) as described in [T.157a]  
     
    The native payload format defined in [CESoPSN] provides a simple 
    and efficient encapsulation for emulation of these point to point 
    PDH services. The payload of each packet includes constant number 
    TDM data bytes. Apart of aligning T1s 193 bits into a 25 byte 
    payload, no other overhead is added. Application state signaling 
    (e.g., CAS) can be supported using the appropriate generic 
    mechanism. 
    Structured N*DS0 emulated service includes fractional E1/T1 
    applications that save bandwidth at the PSN by transferring only 
    "used" timeslots of an E1/T1 circuit, yet allow the CEs to use 
    traditional circuit state indications (AIS/RDI). 
     
    The payload formats defined in [CEP-VT] can be used to emulate 
    structured PDH services using the SONET/SDH byte-synchronous 
    mapping into SONET/SDH encapsulation and unstructured services 
    using the SONET/SDH bit-asynchronous mappings [GR.253][G.707]. 
    These payload formats add SONET/SDH overhead bytes, and therefore 
    are less bandwidth efficient. This encapsulation effectively 
    creates SONET/SDH circuits between the PEs to carry the PDH 
    signals. The additional overhead may be justified in scenarios 
    where multiple PDH circuits are carried from one PE to the other, 
    or when the service expectations include SONET/SDH like operation, 
    administration, maintenance and provisioning (OAM&P) capabilities.

 5.2       Multi-Point to Multi-Point SONET/SDH Emulation 
     
    [CEP-SPE] defines SONET/SDH circuit emulation for SONET STS-1/SDH 
    VC-3 SPEs as well as for the higher concatenated STS-Nc SPE (N = 3, 
    12, 48, or 192)/SDH VC-4, VC-4-4c, VC-4-16c, or VC-4-64c SPEs.  
     
    Because the protocol terminates the SONET/SDH section and line 
    before emulating the individual SPEs, the protocol allows the PSN 
    to operate as a distributed SONET/SDH STS level cross-connect.  
     
    [CEP-VT] adds circuit emulation for SONET VT1.5/2/3/6 and SDH VC-
    11/12/2 circuits. Together the provide emulation for the complete 
    SONET/SDH circuit hierarchy. 
     
    Because the protocol can also terminate the SONET/SDH path [CEP-VT] 
    before emulating the individual SONET VTs or SDH VC-11/12/2, the 
    protocol allows the PSN to operate as a distributed SONET/SDH VT 
    level cross-connect. 
     
    [CEP-VT] defines fractional STS-1/VC-3/VC-4 payload formats 
    removing all unequipped or unswitched tributaries. Alternatively, 
    only the relevant tributaries can be switched using the SONET 
    VT1.5/2/3/6 or SDH VC-11/12/2 payload format.  
     
    The fractional STS-1/VC-3/VC-4 encapsulation is the only technique 
    that allows carriage of virtually concatenated tributaries. It 
    ensures that the delay variation introduced by the emulation 
    process would be the same for all tributaries within the 
    concatenated service, enabling easier implementation of the virtual 
    concatenation termination. An example of use of virtual 
    concatenation for delivering PPP streams is defined in [RFC3255]. 
     
 5.3       Multi-point to point PDH to SONET/SDH Emulation 
     
    The access and metro networks can benefit from the deployment of 
    circuit emulation technology, aggregating multiple PDH circuits 
    into a SONET/SDH uplink. This deployment is fostered by the 
    development of new layer 2 packet technologies adapted specifically 
    for the access and metro network requirements. Multiple provider 
    edge (PE) access devices provide PDH links (T1/E1/T3/E3) to their 
    CEs while a PE closer to the central office aggregates the circuits 
    to a SONET/SDH OC-3/OC-12 trunk.  
     
    Two approaches can be taken. The first approach is to extend the 
    SONET/SDH trunk across the PSN [CEP-VT] towards the PDH PEs. The 
    second approach is using the native TDM emulation [CESoPSN] to 
    extend the PDH links over the PSN and map the PDH signals into the 
    SONET/SDH trunk at the SONET/SDH PE.

                 TDM emulation applicability statement       June 2002 
  
  
    Using the [CEP-VT] payload format the relevant circuits are 
    extracted from the SONET/SDH trunk and sent unmodified across the 
    PSN to the access PEs. The SONET/SDH overhead bytes are used to 
    extend the OAM&P functionality up to the access PEs. This extension 
    of OAM&P includes the ability to monitor errors across the entire 
    SONET/SDH path, including bit parity, remote error indications, end 
    to end path trace functionality and protection functionality. The 
    SONET/SDH emulation allows the required flexibility of the number 
    of circuits distributed over the PSN to each access device. A SONET 
    VT1.5 circuit delivering a T1 circuit across the PSN can be 
    extended into a fractional STS-1 circuit carrying 5 VT1.5 and 
    finally extended to a complete STS-1 carrying 28 VT1.5 circuits, 
    according to the increasing demand for emulated circuit ports 
    within the same access PE. 
     
    Using the native payload format [CESoPSN], the PDH circuits can be 
    extended across the PSN and mapped to the SONET/SDH trunk at the 
    SONET/SDH PE. The flexibility in the maximal payload size and the 
    N*DS0 payload format can be used to optimize bandwidth efficiency.  
     
 6.     Security Considerations  
      
    TDM circuit emulation does not introduce additional security 
    considerations beyond those discussed in section 9 of [PWE3-
    LAYERS].
