  Abstract 
   
     In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-ps, the problems with using global IP mobility 
     management protocols for local mobility and some problems with existing 
     localized mobility management protocols are described. In this document, we 
     explore requirements for localized mobility management in more detail. An 
     extensive gap analysis against the protocols illustrates where existing 
     protocols are able to fulfill the requirements and where they are lacking.

   1.0 Introduction 
         
     In draft-kempf-netlmm-nohost-ps [1], the basic problems that occur when a 
     global mobility protocol is used for managing local mobility are described, 
     and two basic approaches to localized mobility management - the host-based 
     approach that is used by most IETF protocols and the WLAN switch approach 
     are examined. The conclusion from the problem statement document is that 
     neither approach has a complete solution to the problem. While the WLAN 
     switch approach is most convenient for network operators and users because 
     it requires no host support, the proprietary nature limits interoperability 
     and the restriction to a single wireless link type and wired backhaul link 
     type restricts scalablity. The IETF host-based protocols require host 
     software stack changes that may not be compatible with all global mobility 
     protocols, and also require specialized and complex security transactions 
     with the network that may limit deployability.   
      
     This document develops more detailed requirements for a localized mobility 
     management  protocol  and  analyzes  existing  protocols  against  those 
     requirements. In Section 2.0, we review a list of requirements that are 
     desirable in a localized mobility management solution. Section 3.0 performs 
     a gap analysis against the requirements of proposed solutions to localized 
     mobility management. Section 4.0 briefly outlines security considerations. 
     Finally, in Section 5.0, a recommendation is made for the development of a 
     network-based approach to localized mobility management. 
      
  1.1 Terminology 
      
     Mobility terminology in this draft follows that in RFC 3753 [2] and in [1]. 
     In addition, the following terms are used here: 
      
        Host-Based Approach 
          A host-based approach to localized mobility management requires binding 
          between a local care-of address and a regional care-of address at a 
          mobility anchor within the localized mobility management domain. The 
          binding is maintained by the mobile node and requires software in the 
          mobile node's stack to perform the binding. The localized mobility 
          service is authorized with the mobility anchor point separately from 
          network access. An example is HMIPv6 [19]. A mobility anchor is a kind 
          of localized mobility management domain gateway. The regional care-of 
          address is fixed at the mobility anchor while the local care-of address 
          on the access router changes when the mobile node moves to a new IP 
          link. 
           
        Micromobility Approach 
          A micromobility approach to localized mobility management requires host 
          route propagation from the mobile node to a collection of specialized 
          routers in the localized mobility management domain along a path back 
          to a boundary router at the edge of the localized mobility management 
          domain. A boundary router is a kind of localized mobility management 
      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 2] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
          domain gateway. Localized mobility management is authorized with the 
          access router, but reauthorization with each new access router is 
          necessary on IP link movement, in addition to any reauthorization for 
          basic network access. The host routes allow the mobile node to maintain 
          the same IP address when it moves to a new IP link, and still continue 
          to receive packets on the new IP link. 
           
        Edge Mobility Approach 
          In the edge mobility approach to localized mobility management, the 
          access routers update bindings between the mobile node's care-of 
          address and the mobile node's current IP link. The bindings are 
          maintained at an edge mobility anchor point. No host involvement is 
          required beyond movement detection. The mobile node requires no special 
          authorization for localized mobility management service beyond the 
          authorization required for basic network access. A mobile node's IP 
          address does not change when the mobile node moves from one access 
          router to another within the coverage area of the edge mobility anchor 
          point, because the mobility anchor and access routers take care of 
          changing the routing. 
            
   2.0 Requirements for Localized Mobility Management 
      
     Any localized mobility solution must naturally address the three problems 
     described in [1]. In addition, the side effects of introducing such a 
     solution into the network need to be limited. In this section, we address 
     requirements on a localized mobility solution including both solving the 
     basic problems and limiting the side effects. 
      
     Some basic requirements of all IETF protocols are not discussed in detail 
     here, but any solution is expected to satisfy them. These requirements are 
     interoperability,  scalability,  and  minimal  requirement  for  specialized 
     network  equipment.  A  good  discussion  of  their  applicability  to  IETF 
     protocols can be found in [3]. 
      
     Out of scope for the initial requirements discussion are QoS, multicast, and 
     dormant mode/paging. While these are important functions for mobile hosts, 
     they are not part of the base localized mobility management problem. In 
     addition, mobility between localized mobility management domains is not 
     covered here. It is assumed that this is covered by the global mobility 
     management protocols. 
       
  2.1     Handover Performance Improvement (Requirement #1) 
      
     Handover packet loss occurs because there is usually latency between when 
     the wireless link handover starts and when the IP link handover completes. 
     During this time the mobile node is unreachable at its former topological 
     location on the old IP link where correspondents are sending packets and to 
     which the routing system is routing them. Such misrouted packets are 
     dropped. This aspect of handover performance optimization has been the 
     subject of an enormous amount of work, both in other SDOs, to reduce the 
     latency of wireless link handover, and in the IETF and elsewhere, to reduce 
     the latency in IP link handover. Many solutions to this problem have been 
     proposed at the wireless link layer and at the IP layer.

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     Note that a related problem occurs when traffic packets are not routed 
     through a global mobility anchor such as a Mobile IP home agent. Route 
     optimized Mobile IPv6 [4] and HIP [5] are examples. A loss of connectivity 
     can occur when both sides of the IP conversation are mobile and they both 
     hand over at the same time. The two sides must use a global mobility anchor 
     point,  like  a  home  agent  or  rendezvous  server,  to  re-establish  the 
     connection, but there may be substantial packet loss until the problem is 
     discovered.  
      
     In both cases, the loss of accurate routing caused the connection to 
     experience an interruption which may cause service degradation for real time 
     traffic such as voice 
      
  2.2     Reduction in Handover-related Signaling Volume (Requirement #2) 
      
     Considering Mobile IPv6 as the global mobility protocol (other mobility 
     protocols require about the same or somewhat less), if a mobile node is 
     required to reconfigure on every move between IP links, the following set of 
     signaling messages must be done: 
      
     1) Movement detection using DNA [6] or possibly a link specific protocol, 
     2) Any link layer or IP layer AAA signaling, such as 802.1x [7] or PANA [8]. 
        The mobile node may also or instead have to obtain a router certificate 
        using SEND [9], if the certificate is not already cached, 
     3) Router discovery which may be part of movement detection, 
     4) If stateless address autoconfiguration is used, address configuration and 
        Duplicate  Address  Detection  (unless  optimistic  Duplicate  Address 
        Detection [10] is used). If stateful address configuration is used, then 
        DHCP is used for address configuration, 
     5) Binding Update to the home agent, 
     6) If route optimization is in effect, return routability to establish the 
        binding key, 
     7) Binding Update to correspondent nodes for route optimization. 
      
     Note that Steps 1-2 will always be necessary, even for intra-link mobility, 
     and Step 3 will be necessary even if the mobile node's care-of address can 
     remain the same when it moves to a new access router. 
      
     This is a lot of signaling just to get up on a new IP link. Furthermore, in 
     some cases, the mobile node may need to engage in "heartbeat signaling" to 
     keep the connection with the correspondent or global mobility anchor fresh, 
     for example, return routability in Mobile IPv6 must be done at a maximum 
     every 7 minutes even if the mobile node is standing still.  
      
  2.3     Location privacy (Requirement #3) 
      
     Location privacy in the context of IP mobility refers to hiding the 
     geographic location of mobile users. Although general location privacy 
     issues have been discussed in [12], the location privacy referred to here 
     focuses on the IP layer and involves the basic property of the IP address 
     that may change due to the mobility. The location information should not be 
     revealed to nor deduced by the correspondent node without the authorization 
     of the mobile node's owner. Since the localized mobility management protocol 
     is responsible for the MN mobility within the local mobility management 
      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 4] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     domain,  it  should  conceal  geographical  movement  of  the  mobile  node. 
      
     The threats to location privacy come in a variety of forms. Perhaps least 
     likely  is  a  man  in  the  middle  attack  in  which  traffic  between  a 
     correspondent and the mobile node is intercepted and the mobile node's 
     location is deduced from that, since man in the middle attacks in the 
     Internet tend to be fairly rare. More likely are attacks in which the 
     correspondent is the attacker or the correspondent or even mobile node 
     itself are relaying information on the care-of address change to someone. 
     The owner of the correspondent or mobile node might not even be aware of the 
     problem if an attacker has installed spyware or some other kind of exploit 
     on the mobile node and the malware is relaying the change in care-of address 
     to an attacker. 
      
     Note that the location privacy referred to here is different from the 
     location privacy discussed in [14][15][16]. The location privacy discussed 
     in these drafts primarily concerns modifications to the Mobile IPv6 protocol 
     to eliminate places where an eavesdropper could track the mobile node's 
     movement by correlating home address and care of address.    
      
  2.4     Efficient Use of Wireless Resources (Requirement #4) 
      
     Advances in wireless PHY and MAC technology continue to increase the 
     bandwidth available from limited wireless spectrum, but even with technology 
     increases, wireless spectrum remains a limited resource. Unlike wired 
     network links, wireless links are constrained in the number of bits/Hertz by 
     their coding technology and use of physical spectrum, which is fixed by the 
     PHY. It is not possible to lay an extra cable if the link becomes 
     increasingly congested as is the case with wired links.  
      
     Some existing localized mobility management solutions increase packet size 
     over the wireless link by adding tunneling or other per packet overhead. 
     While header compression technology can remove header overhead, header 
     compression does not come without cost. Requiring header compression on the 
     wireless access points increases the cost and complexity of the access 
     points, and increases the amount of processing required for traffic across 
     the wireless link. Since the access points tend to be a critical bottleneck 
     in wireless access networks for real time traffic (especially on the 
     downlink), reducing the amount of per-packet processing is important. While 
     header compression probably cannot be completely eliminated, especially for 
     real time media traffic, simplifying compression to reduce processing cost 
     is an important requirement. 
      
  2.5 Reduction of Signaling Overhead in the Network (Requirement #5) 
      
     While bandwidth and router processing resources are typically not as 
     constrained in the wired network, wired networks tend to have higher 
     bandwidth  and  router  processing  constraints  than  the  backbone.  These 
     constraints are a function of the cost of laying fiber or wiring to the 
     wireless access points in a widely dispersed geographic area. Therefore, any 
     solutions for localized mobility management should minimize signaling within 
     the wired network as well.

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
  2.6 No Extra Security Between Mobile Node and Network (Requirement #6) 
      
     Localized mobility management protocols that have signaling between the host 
     and network require a security association between the host and the network 
     entity that is the target of the signaling. Establishing a security 
     association  specifically  for  localized  mobility  service  in  a  roaming 
     situation may prove difficult, because provisioning a mobile node with 
     security credentials for authenticating and authorizing localized mobility 
     service in each roaming partner's network may be unrealistic from a 
     deployment perspective. Reducing the complexity of host to network security 
     for  localized  mobility  management  can  therefore  reduce  barriers  to 
     deployment. 
      
     Removing host involvement in localized mobility management also limits the 
     possibility of DoS attacks on network infrastructural elements. In a host 
     based approach, the host is required to have a global or restricted routing 
     local IP address for a network infrastructure element, the mobility anchor 
     point. The network infrastructural element therefore becomes a possible 
     target for DoS attacks, even if hosts are properly authenticated. A properly 
     authenticated host can either willfully or inadvertently give the network 
     infrastructural element address to an attacker.  
      
     In summary, ruling out host involvement in local mobility management 
     simplifies security by removing the need for service-specific credentials to 
     authenticate and authorize the host for localized mobility management in the 
     network  and  by  limiting  the  possibility  of  DoS  attacks  on  network 
     infrastructural elements.  
      
  2.7 Support for Heterogeneous Wireless Link Technologies (Requirement #7) 
      
     The number of wireless link technologies available is growing, and the 
     growth seems unlikely to slow down. Since the standardization of a wireless 
     link PHY and MAC is a time consuming process, reducing the amount of work 
     necessary to interface a particular wireless link technology to an IP 
     network is necessary. A localized mobility management solution should 
     ideally  require  minimal  work  to  interface  with  a  new  wireless  link 
     technology. 
      
     In addition, an edge mobility solution should provide support for multiple 
     wireless link technologies within the network in separate subnets. The edge 
     mobility solution should also support handover between different wireless 
     link technologies. 
      
      
  2.8 Support for Unmodified Hosts (Requirement #8) 
      
     A localized mobility management solution should be able to support any host 
     that walks up to the link and has a wireless interface that can communicate 
     with the network, without requiring localized mobility management software 
     on the host. This approach has been extremely successful in the wireless LAN 
     switching  market,  because  it  reduces  the  burden  of  host  software 
     installation on the user. In addition, being able to accommodate unmodified 
     hosts enables a service provider to offer service to as many customers as 

      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 6] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     possible, the only constraint being that the customer is authorized for 
     network access.  
      
     As a practical matter, there may be some constraints that require some 
     configuration on the host. The host must have some kind of global mobility 
     protocol if it is to move from one domain of edge mobility support to 
     another, although no global mobility protocol is required if the host only 
     moves  within  the  coverage  area  of  the  localized  mobility  management 
     protocol. Also, every wireless link protocol requires handover support on 
     the host in the physical and MAC layers. Information from the MAC layer to 
     the IP layer on the host may be necessary to trigger signaling for IP link 
     handover. The localized mobility solution should be able to accommodate 
     wireless link protocols with host handover support. 
      
     Another  advantage  of  minimizing  host  changes  for  localized  mobility 
     management is that multiple global mobility management protocols can be 
     supported with a localized mobility management solution that does not have 
     host  involvement.  While  Mobile  IPv6  is  clearly  the  global  mobility 
     management protocol of primary interest going forward, there are a variety 
     of global mobility management protocols that might also need support, 
     including proprietary protocols needing support for backward compatibility 
     reasons. Within IETF, both HIP and Mobike are likely to need support in 
     addition to Mobile IPv6, and Mobile IPv4 support may also be necessary. 
      
  2.9 Support for IPv4 and IPv6 (Requirement #9) 
      
     While most of this document is written with IPv6 in mind, localized mobility 
     management is a problem in IPv4 networks as well. A solution for localized 
     mobility that works for both versions of IP is desirable, though the actual 
     protocol may be slightly different due to the technical details of how each 
     IP version works. From Requirement #8 (Section 2.8), minimizing host support 
     for localized mobility means that ideally no IP version-specific changes 
     would be required on the host for localized mobility, and that global 
     mobility protocols for both IPv4 and IPv6 should be supported. Any IP 
     version-specific features would be confined to the network protocol. 
      
   3.0 Gap Analysis 
      
     This section discusses a gap analysis between existing proposals for solving 
     localized mobility management and the requirement sin Section. 2.0. 
      
  3.1 Mobile IPv6 with Local Home Agent 
      
     One option is to deploy Mobile IPv6 with a locally assigned home agent in 
     the local network. This solution requires the mobile node to somehow be 
     assigned a home agent in the local network when it boots up. This home agent 
     is used instead of the home agent in the home network. The advantage of this 
     option is that the no special solution is required for edge mobility - the 
     mobile node reuses the global mobility management protocol for that purpose 
     - if the mobile node is using Mobile IPv6. One disadvantage is that Mobile 
     IP has no provision for handover between home agents. Although such handover 
     should be infrequent, it could be quite lengthy and complex.

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     The analysis of this approach against the requirements above is the 
     following. 
      
     Requirement #1: If the mobile node does not perform route optimization, this 
     solution  reduces,  but  does  not  eliminate,  IP  link  handover  related 
     performance problems. 
       
     Requirement #2: Similarly to Requirement #1, signaling volume is reduced if 
     no route optimization signaling is done on handover.  
      
     Requirement #3: Location privacy is preserved for external correspondents, 
     but the mobile node itself still maintains a local care-of address which a 
     worm or other exploit could misuse. If the mobile node does perform route 
     optimization, location privacy may be compromised, and this solution is no 
     better than having a remote home agent. 
      
     Requirement #4: If traffic is not route optimized, the mobile node still 
     pays for an over-the-air tunnel to the locally assigned home agent. The 
     overhead here is exactly the same as if the mobile node's home agent in the 
     home network is used and route optimization is not done. 
      
     Requirement #5: If the localized mobility management domain is large, the 
     mobile node may suffer from unoptimzed routes since handover and mobility 
     between home agents is not supported. 
      
     Requirement #6: A local home agent in a roaming situation requires the guest 
     mobile node to have the proper credentials to authenticate with the local 
     home agent in the serving network. In addition, as in Requirement #3, the 
     local home agent's address could become the target of a DoS attack if 
     revealed to an attacker. So a local home agent would provide no benefit for 
     this requirement. 
      
     Requirement #7: This solution supports multiple wireless technologies in 
     separate IP link subnets. No special work is required to interface a local 
     home agent to different wireless technologies. 
      
     Requirement #8: The host must support Mobile IPv6 in order for this option 
     to work. So host stack changes are required and other IP mobility protocols 
     are not supported.  
       
     Requirement #9: This solution requires separate locally assigned home agents 
     for Mobile IPv4 and Mobile IPv6 since the local home agent should have MIP 
     functions or IPv4 or IPv6 in conjunction with IP version of global mobility 
     protocol, or some way to register an IPv4 care of address to home address 
     mapping in an Mobile IPv6 home agent. While there are a couple of proposals 
     currently active in the IETF for this (see [17] for one), it is not clear at 
     this point whether they will be adopted for standards track development. 
           
  3.2     Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) 
      
     HMIPv6  [19]  provides  the  most  complete  localized  mobility  management 
     solution available today as an Internet RFC. In HMIPv6, a localized mobility 
     anchor called a MAP serves as a routing anchor for a regional care-of 
     address. When a mobile node moves from one access router to another, the 
      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 8] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     mobile node changes the binding between its regional care-of address and 
     local care-of address at the MAP. No global mobility management signaling is 
     required, since the care-of address seen by correspondents does not change. 
     This part of HMIPv6 is similar to the solution outlined in Section 3.1; 
     however, HMIPv6 also allows a mobile node to hand over between MAPs. 
      
     Handover between MAPs and MAP discovery requires configuration on the 
     routers. MAP addresses are advertised by access routers. Handover happens by 
     overlapping MAP coverage areas so that, for some number of access routers, 
     more than one MAP may be advertised. Mobile nodes need to switch MAPs in the 
     transition area, and then must perform global mobility management update and 
     route optimization to the new regional care-of address, if appropriate. 
      
     The analysis of this approach against the requirements above is the 
     following. 
      
     Requirement #1 This solution shortens, but does not eliminate, the latency 
     associated with IP link handover, since it reduces the amount of signaling 
     and the length of the signaling paths.  
      
     Requirement  #2  Signaling  volume  is  reduced  simply  because  no  route 
     optimization signaling is done on handover within the coverage area of the 
     MAP.  
      
     Requirement #3 Location privacy is preserved for external correspondents, 
     but the mobile node itself still maintains a local care-of address which a 
     worm or other exploit could access by sending the local care-of address to 
     third malicious node to enable it to track the MN∆s location. 
      
     Requirement #4 The mobile node always pays for an over-the-air tunnel to the 
     MAP. If the mobile node is tunneling through a global home agent or VPN 
     gateway, the wired link experiences double tunneling. Over-the-air tunnel 
     overhead can be removed by header compression, however. 
      
     Requirement #5 From Requirement #1 and Requirement #4, the signaling 
     overhead is no more or less than for mobile nodes whose global mobility 
     management anchor is local. However, because MAP handover is possible, 
     routes across large localized mobility management domains can be improved 
     thereby improving wired network resource utilization by using multiple MAPs 
     and handing over, at the expense of the configuration and management 
     overhead involved in maintaining multiple MAP coverage areas.  
      
     Requirement #6 In a roaming situation, the guest mobile node must have the 
     proper credentials to authenticate with the MAP in the serving network. In 
     addition, since the mobile node is required to have a unicast address for 
     the MAP that is either globally routed or routing restricted to the local 
     administrative domain, the MAP is potentially a target for DoS attacks 
     across a wide swath of network topology. 
      
     Requirement #7 This solution supports multiple wireless technologies in 
     separate IP link subnets.

     Requirement  #8  This  solution  requires  modification  to  the  hosts.  In 
     addition, the HMIPv6 design has been optimized for Mobile IPv6 hosts, and is 
     not a good match for other global mobility management protocols.  
      
     Requirement #9 Currently, there is no IPv4 version of this protocol; 
     although there is an expired Internet draft with a design for a regional 
     registration protocol for Mobile IPv4 that has similar functionality. 
      
  3.3 Combinations of Mobile IPv6 with Optimizations 
      
     One approach to local mobility that has received much attention in the past 
     and has been thought to provide a solution is combinations of protocols. The 
     general approach is to try to cover gaps in the solution provided by MIPv6 
     by using other protocols. In this section, gap analyses for MIPv6 + FMIPv6 
     and HMIPv6 + FMIPv6 are discussed.  
      
  3.3.1 MIPv6 + FMIPv6 
      
     As discussed in Section 3.1, the use of MIPv6 with a dynamically assigned, 
     local home agent cannot fulfill the requirements. A fundamental limitation 
     is that Mobile IPv6 cannot provide seamless handover (i.e. Requirement #1). 
     FMIPv6 has been defined with the intent to improve the handover performance 
     of MIPv6. For this reason, the combined usage of FMIPv6 and MIPv6 with a 
     dynamically assigned local home agent has been proposed to handle local 
     mobility.  
      
     Note that this gap analysis only applies to localized mobility management, 
     and it is possible that MIPv6 and FMIPv6 might still be acceptable for 
     global mobility management. 
      
     The analysis of this combined approach against the requirements follows.  
      
     Requirement  #1  FMIPv6  provides  a  solution  for  handover  performance 
     improvement  that  should  fulfill  the  requirements  raised  by  real-time 
     applications in terms of jitter, delay and packet loss. The location of the 
     home agent (in local or home domain) does not affect the handover latency.  
      
     Requirement #2 FMIPv6 requires the MN to perform extra signaling with the 
     access router (i.e. exchange of RtSolPr/PrRtAdv and FBU/FBA). Moreover, as 
     in standard MIPv6, whenever the mobile node moves to another IP link, it 
     must send a Binding Update to the home agent. If route optimization is used, 
     the mobile node also performs return routability and sends a Binding Update 
     to each correspondent node. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that FMIPv6 
     should result in a reduction of the amount of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery 
     signaling on the new link.  
      
     Requirement #3 The mobile node mantains a local care-of address. If route 
     optimization is not used, location privacy can be achieved using bi-
     directional tunneling. However, as mentioned in Section 3.1, a worm or other  
     malware can exploit this care of address by sending it to a third malicious 
     node.  
      
     Requirement #4 As stated for Requirement #2, the combination of MIPv6 and 
     FMIPv6 generates extra signaling overhead. For data packets, in addition to 
      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 10] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     the Mobile IPv6 over-the-air tunnel, there is a further level of tunneling 
     between the mobile node and the previous access router during handover. This 
     tunnel is needed to forward incoming packets to the mobile node addressed to 
     the previous care-of address. Another reason is that, even if the mobile 
     node has a valid new care-of address, the mobile node cannot use the new 
     care of address directly with its correspondents without performing route 
     optimization to the new care of address. This implies that the transient 
     tunnel overhead is in place even for route optimized traffic.  
      
     Requirement #5 FMIPv6 generates extra signaling overhead between previous 
     the access router and the new access router for the HI/HAck exchange. 
     Concerning  data  packets,  the  use  of  FMIPv6  for  handover  performance 
     improvement implies a tunnel between the previous access router and the 
     mobile node that adds some overhead in the wired network. This overhead has 
     more impact on star topology deployments, since packets are routed down to 
     the old access router, then back up to the aggregation router and then back 
     down to the new access router.  
      
     Requirement #6 In addition to the analysis for Mobile IPv6 with local home 
     agent in Section 3.1, FMIPv6 requires the mobile node and the previous 
     access router to share a security association in order to secure FBU/FBA 
     exchange. So far, only a SEND-based solution has been proposed and this 
     requires the MN to use autoconfigured Cryptographically Generated Addresses 
     (CGAs)[20]. This precludes stateful address allocation using DHCP, which 
     might be a necessary deployment in certain circumstances. Another solution 
     based on AAA is under study but it could require extra signaling overhead 
     over the air and in the wired network and it could raise performance issues.  
      
     Requirement #7 MIPv6 and FMIPv6 support multiple wireless technologies, so 
     this requirement is fufilled.  
      
     Requirement #8 The host must support both MIPv6 and FMIPv6, so it is not 
     possible to satisfy this requirement. 
      
     Requirement #9 Work is underway to extend MIPv6 with the capability to run 
     over both IPv6-enabled and IPv4-only networks [17]. FMIPv6 only supports 
     IPv6. Even though an IPv4 version of FMIP has been recently proposed, it is 
     not clear how it could be used together with FMIPv6 in order to handle fast 
     handovers across any wired network.  
      
  3.3.2 HMIPv6 + FMIPv6  
      
     HMIPv6 provides several advantages in terms of local mobility management. 
     However, as seen in Section 3.2, it does not fulfill all the requirements 
     identified in Section 2.0. In particular, HMIPv6 does not completely 
     eliminate the IP link handover latency. For this reason, FMIPv6 could be 
     used together with HMIPv6 in order to cover the gap.  
      
     Note that even if this solution is used, the mobile node is likely to need 
     MIPv6 for global mobility management, in contrast with the MIPv6 with 
     dynamically assigned local home agent + FMIPv6 solution. Thus, this solution 
     should really be considered MIPv6 + HMIPv6 + FMIPv6.  
      
     The analysis of this combined approach against the requirements follows.        
      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 11] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
      
     Requirement #1 HMIPv6 and FMIPv6 both shorten the latency associated with IP 
     link  handovers.  In  particular,  FMIPv6  is  expected  to  fulfill  the 
     requirements  on  jitter,  delay  and  packet  loss  raised  by  real-time 
     applications. 
      
     Requirement #2 Both FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 require extra signaling compared with 
     Mobile IPv6. As a whole the mobile node performs signaling message exchanges 
     at each handover that are RtSolPr/PrRtAdv, FBU/FBA, LBU/LBA and BU/BA. 
     However, as mentioned in Section 3.2, the use of HMIPv6 reduces the 
     signaling overhead since no route optimization signaling is done for intra-
     MAP handovers. In addition, naève combinations of FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 often 
     result in redundant signaling. There is much work in the academic literature 
     and the IETF on more refined ways of combining signaling from the two 
     protocols to avoid redundant signaling.    
      
     Requirement #3 HMIPv6 may preserve location privacy, depending on the 
     dimension of the geographic area covered by the MAP. As discussed in Section 
     3.2, the mobile node still maintains a local care-of address that can be 
     exploited by worms or other malware.   
      
     Requirement #4 As mentioned for Requirement #2, the combination of HMIPv6 
     and FMIPv6 generates a lot of signaling overhead in the network. Concerning 
     payload data, in addition to the over-the-air MIPv6 tunnel, a further level 
     of tunneling is established between mobile node and MAP. Notice that this 
     tunnel is in place even for route optimized traffic. Moreover, if FMIPv6 is 
     directly applied to HMIPv6 networks, there is a third temporary handover-
     related tunnel between the mobile node and previous access router. Again, 
     there is much work in the academic literature and IETF on ways to reduce the 
     extra tunnel overhead on handover by combining HMIP and FMIP tunneling.  
      
     Requirement #5 The signaling overhead in the network is not reduced by 
     HMIPv6, as mentioned in Section 3.2. Instead, FMIPv6 generates extra 
     signaling overhead between the previous access router and new access router 
     for HI/HAck exchange. For payload data, the same considerations as for 
     Requirement #4 are applicable.  
      
     Requirement #6 FMIPv6 requires the mobile node and the previous access 
     router to share a security association in order to secure the FBU/FBA 
     exchange. In addition, HMIPv6 requires that the mobile node and MAP share an 
     IPsec security association in order to secure LBU/LBA exchange. The only 
     well understood approach to set up an IPsec security association using of 
     certificates, but this may raise deployment issues. Thus, the combination of 
     FMIPv6 and HMIPv6 doubles the amount of host to network security protocol 
     required, since security for both FMIP and HMIP must be deployed. 
      
     Requirement #7 HMIPv6 and FMIPv6 support multiple wireless technologies, so 
     this requirement is fufilled.  
      
     Requirement #8 The host must support both HMIPv6 and FMIPv6 protocols, so 
     this requirement is not fulfilled.

     Requirement #9 Currently there is no IPv4 version of HMIPv6. There is an 
     IPv4 version of FMIP but it is not clear how it could be used together with 
     FMIPv6 in order to handle fast handovers across any wired network.  
      
  3.4 Micromobility Protocols 
      
     Researchers have defined some protocols that are often characterized as 
     micromobility  protocols.  Two  typical  protocols  in  this  category  are 
     Cellular-IP [21] and HAWAII [22]. Researchers defined these protocols before 
     local mobility optimizations for Mobile IP such as FMIP and HMIP were 
     developed, in order to reduce handover latency. 
      
     Cellular IP and HAWAII have a few things in common.  Both are compatible 
     with Mobile IP and are intended to provide a higher level of handover 
     performance in local networks than was previously available with Mobile IP 
     without such extensions as HMIP and FMIP.  Both use host routes installed in 
     a number of routers within a restricted routing domain. Both define specific 
     messaging to update those routes along the forwarding path and specify how 
     the messaging is to be used to update the routing tables and forwarding 
     tables along the path between the mobile and a micromobility domain boundary 
     router at which point Mobile IP is to used to handle scalable global 
     mobility. Unlike the FMIP and HMIP protocols, however, these protocols do 
     not require the host to obtain a new care of address on each access router 
     as it moves; but rather, the host maintains the same care of address across 
     the micromobility domain. From outside the micromobility domain, the care of 
     address is routed using traditional longest prefix matching IP routing to 
     the domain's boundary router, so the care of address conceptually is within 
     the micromobiity domain boundary router's subnet. Within the micromobility 
     domain, the care of address is routed to the correct access router using 
     host routes. 
      
     Cellular IP and HAWAII differ in a few aspects.  Cellular IP seems to be 
     restricted, based on the nature of the protocol, to tree-based network 
     topologies.  HAWAII claims to be applicable in both tree-based and more 
     complete network topologies.  HAWAII documents more functionality in the 
     realm of reliability and QoS interworking.  Both protocols involve the 
     mobile node itself in mobility operations, although this is also true of the 
     Mobile IP based optimizations, so both protocols raise the same security 
     concerns with respect to authorizing address update as the Mobile IP based 
     optimizations.    HAWAII  provides  some  analysis  of  network  deployment 
     scenarios including scale, density, and efficiency, but some of these 
     assumptions seem very conservative compared to realistic cellular type 
     deployments. 
      
     Micromobility protocols have some potential drawbacks from a deployment and 
     scalability standpoint. Both protocols involve every routing element between 
     the mobile device and the micromobility domain boundary router in all packet 
     forwarding decisions specific to care of addresses for mobile nodes. 
     Scalability is limited because each care of address corresponding to a 
     mobile node generates a routing table entry, and perhaps multiple forwarding 
     table entries, in every router along the path. Since mobile nodes can have 
     multiple global care of addresses in IPv6, this can result in a large 
     expansion in router state throughout the micromobility routing domain. 
     Although the extent of the scalability for micromobility protocols is still 
      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 13] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     not clearly understood from a research standpoint, it seems certain that 
     they will be less scalable than the Mobile IP optimization enhancements, and 
     will require more specialized gear in the wired network. 
      
     The following is a gap analysis of the micromobility protocols against the 
     requirements in Section 2.0: 
      
     Requirement #1 The micromobility protocols reduce handover latency by 
     quickly fixing up routes between the boundary router and the access router. 
     While some additional latency may be expected during host route propagation, 
     it is typically much less than experienced with standard Mobile IP.  
      
     Requirement #2 The micromobility protocols require signaling from the host 
     to the access router to initiate the host route propagation, but that is a 
     considerable reduction over the amount of signaling required to configure to 
     a new IP link. 
      
     Requirement #3 No care-of address changes are exposed to correspondent nodes 
     or  the  mobile  node  itself  while  the  mobile  node  is  moving  in  the 
     micromobility-managed network. Because there is no local care-of address, 
     there is no threat from malware that exposes the location by sending the 
     care-of address to an adversary. 
      
     Requirement #4 The only additional over-the-air signaling is involved in 
     propagating host routes from the mobile node to the network upon movement. 
     Since this signaling would be required for movement detection in any case, 
     it is expected to be minimal. Mobile node traffic experiences no overhead. 
      
     Requirement #5 Host route propagation is required throughout the wired 
     network. The volume of signaling could be more or less depending on the 
     speed of mobile node movement and the size of the wired network. 
      
     Requirement #6 The mobile node only requires a security association of some 
     type with the access router. Because the signaling is causing routes to the 
     mobile  node's  care-of  address  to  change,  the  signaling  must  prove 
     authorization to hold the address. 
      
     Requirement  #7  The  micromobility  protocols  support  multiple  wireless 
     technologies, so this requirement is satisfied. 
      
     Requirement #8 The host must support some way of signaling the access router 
     on link handover, but this is required for movement detection anyway. The 
     nature of the signaling for the micromobility protocols may require host 
     software changes, however. 
      
     Requirement #9  Most of the work on the micromobility protocols was done in 
     IPv4, but little difference could be expected for IPv6.  
      
      
   4.0    Security Considerations 
      
     Sections 2.3 and 2.6 discuss security considerations for edge mobility. 
     Ideally, a single authentication and authorization of the host for entry 
     into a serving network should be sufficient to authorize the host for 
      
     Kempf, et. al.                  Expires January 2006              [Page 14] 

     Internet Draft          LMM Requirements and Gap Analysis        July, 2005 
      
     receiving edge mobility service as well as normal IP routing to and from the 
     Internet. In the other direction, authentication and authorization of the 
     access routers through RFC 3971 [9] should be sufficient for the host to 
     trust the routing infrastructure, including for edge mobility. This limits 
     the serving network's exposure to the host and the host's exposure to the 
     serving network to two points: the NAS (which, in a wireless network is 
     typically built into the wireless access points) and the access routers. Any 
     additional network elements required to implement edge mobility are not 
     directly accessible to the host. 
      
     Sections 2.3 and 2.6 also discuss how involving the host in localized 
     mobility management can increase the probability of DoS attacks or expose 
     location privacy information. Global mobility protocols such as Mobile IPv6 
     that require host to network signaling have the same vulnerability, however, 
     the difference with localized mobility management is that the number of 
     network entities involved and their management is expected to be minimal. In 
     addition, while it would certainly be preferable if global IP mobility could 
     be designed in a way to eliminate any global mobility anchor, the nature of 
     IP routing seems to preclude such an option. Any doubts about the dangers 
     spyware, viruses, and other malware could pose to a design that didn't seek 
     to mitigate such threats can be assuaged by checking the volume of spam that 
     comes through zombies and other compromised hosts. 
      
   5.0    Recommendation 
      
     In view of the gap analysis in Section 3.0, none of the existing solutions 
     provide complete coverage of the requirements. FMIPv6 provides a complete 
     solution to Requirement 3.1 but to no other requirement. FMIP, HMIP and 
     micromobility protocols require that the MN is modified to support the 
     additional functionality. But as analyzed above, the functionality provided 
     by each protocol is does not fully support the set of requirements discussed 
     in Section 2.0. 
      
     We  therefore  recommend  that  a  new,  network  based  localized  mobility 
     management  protocol  be  developed  that  minimizes  or  eliminates  host 
     involvement. Such a localized mobility management protocol can be treated as 
     part of the network infrastructure. This kind of architecture is required to 
     address the gaps with existing protocols described in Section 3.0. The new 
     localized mobility management protocol can be paired with a link layer 
     specific IP link handover optimization protocol, such as are provided by 
     wireless LAN switches, or an IP link handover optimization protocol, such as 
     FMIPv6, to eliminate handover related packet latency. The protocol should 
     minimize the number of specialized routers in the localized mobility 
     management domain to reduce the amount of state update needed upon movement 
     and to allow standardized network equipment to be used where mobility 
     support is not required.  
      
     With the edge mobility approach, a mobile node has a single IP address that 
     does not change when the mobile node moves from one access router to 
     another, because the mobility anchor and access routers take care of 
     changing the routing. An edge mobility approach does not require a separate 
     security association with a network element, reducing the amount of overhead 
     required to get a connection up on the network. In an edge mobility approach, 
     hosts only have link local addresses for access routers, so it is much more

     difficult to mount off-link DoS attacks, and on-link attacks are easier to 
     trace and stop. With the edge mobility approach, no authentication and 
     authorization is necessary beyond that necessary for initial network access 
     and whatever additional authentication and authorization is required by the 
     wireless link layer upon movement between access points.
