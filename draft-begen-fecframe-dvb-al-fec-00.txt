Abstract

   This document describes the Application-layer Forward Error
   Correction (FEC) protocol that was developed by the Digital Video
   Broadcasting (DVB) consortium for the protection of media streams
   over IP networks.  The DVB AL-FEC protocol uses two layers for FEC
   protection.  The first (base) layer is based on the 1-D interleaved
   parity code.  The second (enhancement) layer is based on the Raptor
   code.  Since both of these codes have already been specified in

   separate documents, the current document does not define the details
   of these codes but provides the references to the respective
   specifications.  By offering a layered approach, the DVB AL-FEC
   offers a good protection against both bursty and random packet losses
   at a cost of decent complexity.

Internet-Draft              DVB AL-FEC Scheme                  July 2008


1.  Introduction

   In 2007, the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) consortium published a
   technical specification [DVB-AL-FEC] through European
   Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).  This specification
   covers several areas related to the transmission of MPEG2 transport
   stream-based services over IP networks.

   The Annex E of [DVB-AL-FEC] defines an optional protocol for
   Application-layer FEC (AL-FEC) protection of streaming media for
   DVB-IP services carried over RTP [RFC3550] transport.  The AL-FEC
   protocol uses two layers for protection:  a base layer that is
   produced by the 1-D interleaved parity code, and an enhancement layer
   that is produced by the Raptor code.  Whenever a receiver supports
   AL-FEC protocol, the decoding support for the base-layer FEC is
   mandatory while the decoding support for the enhancement-layer FEC is
   optional.  Both the interleaved parity code and the Raptor code are
   systematic FEC codes, meaning that source packets are always sent as
   part of the transport.

   This document briefly explains the DVB AL-FEC protocol by providing
   references to the two FEC schemes used as part of the AL-FEC
   protocol.  This document considers protection of single sequence RTP
   flows only.

   The DVB AL-FEC protocol can protect any type of source media such as
   audio, video, text or application.  The FEC data at each layer is
   generated by an instance of the FEC Framework
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-framework], which is configured by the FEC
   Framework Configuration Information.  The configuration information
   and the information contained in the Payload IDs of the source and
   repair packets establish the exact associations and relationships
   between the source and repair packets.  This document shows how the
   FEC Framework Configuration Information may be communicated out-of-
   band in Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566].

   The FEC Framework requires the source packets to be transmitted in a
   source flow and the repair packets to be transmitted in one or more
   repair flows.  In other words, the sender MUST NOT mix source and
   repair packets in a single flow.  At the receiver side, if all of the
   source packets are successfully received, there is no need for FEC
   recovery and the repair packets may be discarded.  However, if there
   are missing source packets, the repair packets can be used to recover
   the missing information.

   The block diagram of the encoder side for the systematic DVB AL-FEC
   protection is sketched in Figure 1.  Here, the source packets are fed
   into the parity encoder to produce the parity repair packets.  The

   source packets may also be fed to the Raptor encoder to produce the
   Raptor repair packets.  Source packets as well as the repair packets
   are then sent to the receiver(s) over an IP network.

   The block diagram of the decoder side for the systematic DVB AL-FEC
   protection is sketched in Figure 2.  This is a Minimum Performance
   Decoder since the receiver only supports decoding the base-layer
   repair packets.  If there is a loss among the source packets, the
   parity decoder attempts to recover the missing source packets by
   using the base-layer repair packets.

   On the other hand, if the receiver supports decoding both the base-
   layer and enhancement-layer repair packets, a combined (hybrid)
   decoding approach is adopted to improve the recovery rate of the lost
   packets.  In this case, the decoder is called an Enhanced Decoder.
   Section 3.3 outlines the procedures for hybrid decoding.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  DVB AL-FEC Specification

   The DVB AL-FEC protocol comprises two layers of FEC protection:  1-D
   interleaved parity FEC for the base layer and Raptor FEC for the
   enhancement layer.

3.1.  Base-Layer FEC

   The 1-D interleaved parity FEC uses the exclusive OR (XOR) operation
   to generate the repair symbols.  In a group of D x L source packets,
   the XOR operation is applied to the group of the source packets whose
   sequence numbers are L apart from each other to generate L repair
   packets.  When used in combination with the enhancement layer, the D
   x L block of the source packets protected by one or more FEC packets
   SHALL be wholly contained within a single source block of the Raptor
   code.  Further details of the 1-D interleaved parity code are
   provided in [I-D.begen-fecframe-interleaved-fec-scheme].

Internet-Draft              DVB AL-FEC Scheme                  July 2008


3.2.  Enhancement-Layer FEC

   The Raptor code is a fountain code where as many encoding symbols as
   needed can be generated by the encoder on-the-fly from a source data.
   Due to the fountain property of the Raptor code, multiple enhancement
   layers may also be specified.

   The details of the Raptor code are provided in
   [I-D.watson-fecframe-raptor].  The performances of both the 1-D
   interleaved parity code and Raptor code have been examined in detail
   in [DVB-A115].

3.3.  Hybrid Decoding Procedures

   The receivers that support receiving and decoding both the base and
   enhancement-layer FEC perform hybrid decoding to improve the repair
   performance.  The following step may be followed to perform hybrid
   decoding:

   1.  Base-layer (Parity) Decoding:  In this step, the repair packets
       that are encoded by the parity encoder are processed as usual to
       repair as many missing source packets as possible.

   2.  Enhancement-layer (Raptor) Decoding:  If there are still missing
       source packets after the first step, the repair packets that are
       Raptor encoded are processed with the source packets already
       received and the source packets that are recovered in the first
       step.

   3.  Hybrid Decoding:  If there are still missing source packets after
       the second step, the unprocessed base-layer (parity) repair
       packets are converted to a form in which they can be added to the
       Raptor decoding process.  With this additional information,
       Raptor decoding may potentially recover any remaining missing
       source packet.

   The procedure that should be followed to benefit from the base-layer
   repair packets in the Raptor decoding process is explained in detail
   in Section E5.2 of [DVB-AL-FEC].


4.  Session Description Protocol (SDP) Signaling

   This section provides an SDP [RFC4566] example.  This example uses
   the SDP elements for FEC Framework, which were introduced in
   [I-D.ietf-fecframe-sdp-elements], and the FEC grouping semantics
   [RFC4756].

   Editor's note:  No FEC Encoding IDs have been registered with IANA
   for the 1-D interleaved parity FEC scheme and Raptor FEC scheme.  For
   illustrative purposes, in the example below, FEC Encoding IDs of 10
   and 11 will respectively be used.

   In this example, we have one source video stream (mid:S1), one FEC
   repair stream (mid:R1) that is produced by the 1-D interleaved parity
   FEC scheme as well as another FEC repair stream (mid:R2) that is
   produced by the Raptor FEC scheme.  We form one FEC group with the
   "a=group:FEC S1 R1 R2" line.  The source and repair streams are sent
   to the same port on different multicast groups.  The repair window is
   set to 200 ms.
