1.  Introduction

   This document describes the CONNECT-IP HTTP method.  CONNECT-IP is
   similar to CONNECT-UDP, but allows transmitting IP packets, without
   being limited to just TCP like CONNECT or UDP like CONNECT-UDP.

   CONNECT-IP allows endpoints to set up an IP tunnel between one
   another.  This can be used to implement a consumer VPN, point-to-
   point and point-to-network capabilities as described in [REQS].

Internet-Draft                 CONNECT-IP                    August 2021


1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In this document, we use the term "proxy" to refer to the HTTP server
   that responds to the CONNECT-IP request.  If there are HTTP
   intermediaries (as defined in Section 2.3 of [RFC7230]) between the
   client and the proxy, those are referred to as "intermediaries" in
   this document.

2.  The CONNECT-IP Method

   The CONNECT-IP method establishes a stream to an endpoint server that
   then permits the exchange of control data, such as IP address
   information and other relevant information for successfully
   transmitting IP datagrams between hosts.

   The request-target of a CONNECT-IP request is a URI [URI] which uses
   the "https" scheme and a client-specified path.  When using HTTP/2
   [H2] or later, CONNECT-IP requests use HTTP pseudo-headers with the
   following requirements:

   *  The ":method" pseudo-header field is set to "CONNECT-IP".

   *  The ":scheme" pseudo-header field is set to "https".

   *  The ":path" pseudo-header field is set to the value provided by
      the client.  That value MUST NOT be empty.

   *  The ":authority" pseudo-header field contains the host and port of
      the proxy.  The target of a CONNECT-IP request is the server
      providing the CONNECT-IP featureset, not an individual endpoint
      with which a connection is desired.

   A CONNECT-IP request that does not conform to these restrictions is
   malformed (see [H2], Section 8.1.2.6).

   Any 2xx (Successful) response indicates that the proxy is willing to
   open an IP tunnel between it and the client.  Any response other than
   a successful response indicates that the tunnel has not yet been
   formed.

Internet-Draft                 CONNECT-IP                    August 2021


   A proxy MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header
   fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT-IP.  A client MUST
   treat a successful response to CONNECT-IP containing any Content-
   Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields as malformed.

   A payload within a CONNECT-IP request message has no defined
   semantics; a CONNECT-IP request with a non-empty payload is
   malformed.  Note that the CONNECT-IP stream is used to convey control
   messages, but they are not semantically part of the request or
   response themselves.

   Responses to the CONNECT-IP method are not cacheable.

   The lifetime of the tunnel is tied to the CONNECT-IP stream.  Closing
   the stream (via the FIN bit on a QUIC STREAM frame, or a QUIC
   RESET_STREAM frame) closes the associated tunnel.

3.  Transmitting IP Packets using HTTP Datagrams

   IP packets are sent using HTTP Datagrams [HTTP-DGRAM].  The HTTP
   Datagram Payload contains a full IP packet, from the IP Version field
   until the last byte of the IP Payload.  In order to use HTTP
   Datagrams, the CONNECT-IP client will first decide whether or not to
   use HTTP Datagram Contexts and then register its context ID (or lack
   thereof) using the corresponding registration capsule, see
   [HTTP-DGRAM].

   Since HTTP Datagrams require prior negotiation (for example, in
   HTTP/3 it is necessary to both send and receive the H3_DATAGRAM
   SETTINGS Parameter), clients MUST NOT send any HTTP Datagrams until
   they have established support on a given connection.  If negotiation
   of HTTP Datagrams fails (for example if an HTTP/3 SETTINGS frame was
   received without the H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS Parameter), the client MUST
   consider its CONNECT-IP request as failed.

4.  Forwarding of IP Packets

   Since CONNECT-IP allows the transmission of IP packets over HTTP,
   CONNECT-IP endpoints will most often forward these packets to and
   from traditional IP interfaces.  As such, CONNECT-IP endpoints act as
   IP routers.  When a CONNECT-IP endpoint receives an HTTP Datagram
   containing an IP packet, it will parse the packet's IP header,
   perform any local policy checks (e.g., source address validation),
   check their routing table to pick an outbound interface, and then use
   an implementation-specific mechanism (such as raw sockets) to send
   the IP packet on that interface.

Internet-Draft                 CONNECT-IP                    August 2021


   Conversely, when a CONNECT-IP endpoint receives an IP packet whose
   destination address does not match any local addresses, it consults
   its routing table to pick a forwarding destination, and if the table
   points to a CONNECT-IP tunnel, the endpoint performs the same
   forwarding checks before transmitting the packet inside the tunnel.

   Note that CONNECT-IP endpoints will decrement the IP Hop Count (or
   TTL) upon encapsulation but not decapsulation.  In other words, the
   Hop Count is decremented right before an IP packet is transmitted in
   an HTTP Datagram.  This prevents infinite loops in the presence of
   routing loops, and matches the choices in IPsec [IPSEC].

   Endpoints MAY implement additional filtering policies on the IP
   packets they forward.

5.  Capsules

5.1.  ADDRESS_ASSIGN Capsule

   The ADDRESS_ASSIGN capsule allows an endpoint to inform its peer that
   it has assigned an IP address to it.  It allows assigning a prefix
   which can contain multiple addresses.  This capsule uses a Capsule
   Type of 0xfff100.  Its value uses the following format:

   ADDRESS_ASSIGN Capsule {
     IP Version (8),
     IP Address (32..128),
     IP Prefix Length (8),
   }

                  Figure 1: ADDRESS_ASSIGN Capsule Format

   IP Version:  IP Version of this address assignment.  MUST be either 4
      or 6.

   IP Address:  Assigned IP address.  If the IP Version field has value
      4, the IP Address field SHALL have a length of 32 bits.  If the IP
      Version field has value 6, the IP Address field SHALL have a
      length of 128 bits.

   IP Prefix Length:  Length of the IP Prefix assigned, in bits.  MUST
      be lesser or equal to the length of the IP Address field, in bits.

5.2.  ADDRESS_REQUEST Capsule

   The ADDRESS_REQUEST capsule allows an endpoint to request assignment
   of an IP address from its peer.  It allows the endpoint to optionally
   indicate a preference for which address it would get assigned.  This
   capsule uses a Capsule Type of 0xfff101.  Its value uses the
   following format:

   ADDRESS_REQUEST Capsule {
     IP Version (8),
     IP Address (32..128),
     IP Prefix Length (8),
   }

                  Figure 2: ADDRESS_REQUEST Capsule Format

   IP Version:  IP Version of this address request.  MUST be either 4 or
      6.

   IP Address:  Requested IP address.  If the IP Version field has value
      4, the IP Address field SHALL have a length of 32 bits.  If the IP
      Version field has value 6, the IP Address field SHALL have a
      length of 128 bits.

   IP Prefix Length:  Length of the IP Prefix requested, in bits.  MUST
      be lesser or equal to the length of the IP Address field, in bits.

   Upon receiving the ADDRESS_REQUEST capsule, an endpoint SHOULD assign
   an IP address to its peer, and then respond with an ADDRESS_ASSIGN
   capsule to inform the peer of the assignment.

5.3.  SHUTDOWN Capsule

   The SHUTDOWN capsule allows an endpoint to communicate to its peer
   that it is about to close the CONNECT-IP stream, with a string
   explaining the reason for the shutdown.  This capsule uses a Capsule
   Type of 0xfff105.  Its value uses the following format:

   SHUTDOWN Capsule {
     Reason Phrase (..),
   }

                     Figure 3: SHUTDOWN Capsule Format

   Reason Phrase:  Additional diagnostic information for the shutdown.

      This SHOULD be a UTF-8 encoded string [UTF8], though the frame
      does not carry information, such as language tags, that would aid
      comprehension by any entity other than the one that created the
      text.

   Note that the SHUTDOWN capsule is informational, the tunnel is only
   closed when its corresponding CONNECT-IP stream is closed.  Endpoints
   MAY close the tunnel with a reason phrase by sending the SHUTDOWN
   capsule with the FIN bit set on the underlying QUIC STREAM frame that
   carried it.

6.  Extensibility Considerations

   CONNECT-IP can be extended via multiple mechanisms to increase
   functionality.  There are three main ways to extend CONNECT-IP: HTTP
   headers, Capsule Types, and HTTP Datagram Registration Extension
   Data.  For example, an authentication extension could define an HTTP
   header that allows endpoints to send authentication credentials to
   their peer during the creation of the tunnel.  Alternatively, one
   could specify an extension that defines a new Capsule Type which
   allows exchanging DNS configuration between endpoints.  Additionally,
   an extension to CONNECT-IP can use multiple HTTP Datagram Contexts
   [HTTP-DGRAM] simultaneously to compress some IP packets by
   associating the compression context with an HTTP Datagram Context ID.

7.  Security Considerations

   There are significant risks in allowing arbitrary clients to
   establish a tunnel to arbitrary servers, as that could allow bad
   actors to send traffic and have it attributed to the proxy.  Proxies
   that support CONNECT-IP SHOULD restrict its use to authenticated
   users.  The HTTP Authorization header [AUTH] MAY be used to
   authenticate clients.  More complex authentication schemes are out of
   scope for this document but can be implemented using CONNECT-IP
   extensions.

   Since CONNECT-IP endpoints can proxy IP packets send by their peer,
   they SHOULD follow the guidance in [BCP38] to help prevent denial of
   service attacks.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  HTTP Method

   This document will request IANA to register "CONNECT-IP" in the HTTP
   Method Registry (IETF review) maintained at
   <https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-methods>.

   In this scenario, the client will typically receive a single IP
   address that the proxy has picked from a pool of addresses it
   maintains.  The client will route all traffic through the tunnel.
   The exchange could look as follows:
