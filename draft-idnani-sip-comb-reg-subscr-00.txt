Abstract

   This memo proposes that the headers of REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE be    
   combined, so that a REGISTER message can also be treated as an    
   implicit subscription for events. This memo identifies the need for    
   doing this, and then explains how combining the Registration and 
   Subscription solves the problem. It also presents an example flow    
   demonstrating the use of this combined registration and subscription.   
   The headers being combined will be made optional in the REGISTER and   
   SUBSCRIBE messages - depending on where they do not appear as of    
   today - so that backward compatibility is maintained.

1. Introduction

   This memo tries to solve a problem that occurs in any situation in    
   which a SIP User Agent  caches or in any way acts as a gateway to a   
   Non-SIP device.  In particular, architectures in which SIP is used    
   as the signaling protocol within the core network of a system but the   
   wireless mobile devices that roam within the system are not SIP user    
   agents themselves.

   This memo also introduces the concept of a "Proxy UA" which acts as a   
   gateway between the SIP core network and the SIP-unaware mobile. The    
   Proxy UA is responsible for running the UA call engine for all the    
   mobiles that it is serving, besides converting the call control 
   messages from SIP to legacy protocols and vice-versa.

   SIP uses contact addresses to tie a user∆s address-of-record, which    
   is his logical address, to his/her current location [1]. The contact   
   addresses are centrally registered with a SIP Registrar using a SIP    
   REGISTER message. 

   UAs can also subscribe with presence servers, to get the presence    
   information of other UAs, using the SIP SUBSCRIBE request message.   
   The presence servers send a NOTIFY message to the subscribers, when    
   the presence information changes
   
   Many a times when a mobile user moves from one service area to    
   another, his registration at the old service area is kept active by a   
   proxy UA in that area. This is because the old proxy UA has no way of   
   knowing (or atleast not fast enough way of knowing) that the user has   
   moved, and that there is now a new proxy UA for the user, which is    
   the correct proxy UA.

   This problem is more evident where you have a SIP gateway that talks   
   proprietary protocols to the MS and maintains the MS∆ presence in the

   SIP Registrar by sending SIP REGISTER messages to the SIP Registrar    
   on the MS∆ behalf. In some terms the SIP gateway behaves like a proxy   
   UA to a SIP Registrar.  When the MS moves to another SIP gateway, the   
   new gateway would also send a SIP REGISTER to the SIP Registrar, and    
   record itself as being in the path to the MS. However the data at the   
   old SIP gateway has not been updated, and the old SIP gateway is not    
   aware of the fact that the MS has moved to a new SIP gateway.

2. Background on SIP Events

   Before we go ahead with the solution, it is important to understand    
   how event notification works in SIP. So here is a brief description    
   on SIP event notifications. 

   In general entities in the SIP network can subscribe for resource or   
   state changes with other SIP entities in the network, and these    
   entities can send notifications back to the subscriber, when the   
   state changes.

   A typical flow of messages would be as follows

   +------------+           +----------+
   | Subscriber |           | Notifier |
   +------------+           +----------+
         |                        |
         |     SUBSCRIBE          | Request state subscription
         |----------------------->|
         |                        |
         |     200 OK             | Acknowledge subscription
         |<-----------------------|
         |                        |
         |     NOTIFY             | Return current state information
         |<-----------------------|
         |                        |
         |     200 OK             |
         |----------------------->|
         |                        |
         |     NOTIFY             | Return current state information
         |<-----------------------| when state changes
         |                        |
         |     200 OK             |
         |----------------------->|
         |                        |

   Subscriptions are expired like registrations and should be renewed 
   by subsequent SUBSCRIBE messages.

   It is also important to understand what presence is and how SIP    
   entities use SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY methods to communicate presence

   data. Presence according to RFC 2778 [5] is subscription and    
   notification of changes in the communication state of a user. This 
   communications state consists of the set of communications means, 
   communications address and status of that user. 

   A normal SUBSCRIBE - NOTIFY flow for presence data communication is    
   as follows

   +---------+            +----------+             +---------+
   | Watcher |            | Presence |             |   PUA   |
   +---------+            |  Server  |             +---------+
        |                 +----------+                  |
        |                       |                       |
        |    SUBSCRIBE          |                       |
        |---------------------->|                       |
        |                       |                       |
        |    200 OK             |                       |
        |<----------------------|                       |
        |                       |                       |
        |    NOTIFY             |                       |
        |<----------------------|                       |
        |                       |                       |
        |    200 OK             |                       |
        |---------------------->|                       |
        |                       |                       |
        |                       |    Update Presence    |
        |                       |<----------------------|
        |                       |                       |
        |    NOTIFY             |                       |
        |<----------------------|                       |
        |                       |                       |
        |    200 OK             |                       |
        |---------------------->|                       |
        |                       |                       |

   In the above diagram a watcher (some UA) subscribes for the presence    
   data of PUA with the presence server. The Presence server immediately   
   replies back with the current presence data of the PUA in the NOTIFY    
   message.

   At a later time, when the PUA updates its presence data by some means   
   (could use SIP REGISTER message), the presence server again notifies    
   the watcher, with the new presence data.

3. Proposed Solution

   In a legacy mobile world, the problem would be solved by the HLR    
   sending a "Cancel Location" message to the old MSC-VLR.

         SIP Combined Registration and Subscription         October 2002

   This memo tries to solve the problem in a similar way but by using    
   SIP messages. Here the SIP Registrar would somehow need to notify the   
   old SIP proxy UA (or SIP gateway) that the MS has moved to a new SIP    
   proxy UA.

   This memo proposes that

   -  We combine the SIP Registrar and the Presence Server.  However the      
      Registrar and the Presence Server should process the expirations       
      of registrations and subscriptions independently. This basically       
      means that even if a registration may have expired due to a       
      contact being overwritten, the subscription will still be active,       
      until the expiration timer runs out. A user can however explicitly      
      de-subscribe by sending a SUBSCRIBE with "Expires" header set to       
      0, or by sending a combined SIP REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE method (as      
      described below), with the "Expires" header set to 0.

   -  It further proposes that we combine the headers of SIP REGISTER       
      method and SIP SUBSCRIBE method so that an explicit SUBSCRIBE is       
      not required. This invention proposes that the SUBSCRIBE header       
      "Event" be made optional in the SIP REGISTER message. Currently       
      the header is not supported in the REGISTER message. When the SIP      
      Registrar + SIP Presence Server sees a REGISTER message with an       
      "Event" header, it SHOULD implicitly subscribe the UA for the       
      event mentioned (presence in this case). So when the presence       
      information changes - like the contact address being replaced with      
      a new one, or a new contact address being added to the contact       
      list - the old contact (proxy UA or SIP gateway in our case)       
      SHOULD be notified of the change.

   -  This memo also proposes that a NOTIFY SHOULD not be sent       
      immediately on receiving the REGISTER, since the proxy UA would       
      have all the required information on presence, or would get it in 
      the 200 OK response. So a NOTIFY SHOULD only be sent when the       
      presence information changes like when the old contact is removed,      
      or a new contact address is added,  the old contact SHOULD to be       
      informed of this change.

4. SIP Registrar

   The SIP Registrar SHOULD also act as a Presence Server in this case.    
   The SIP Registrar SHOULD subscribe the Proxy UA to presence    
   information when it receives the combined SIP REGISTER and SUBSCRIBE   
   message. If there is already a contact address for the subscriber    
   being registered, and the contact is subscribed for presence    
   information, a NOTIFY message SHOULD be sent to the old contact to    
   inform it about the change in  presence data. The Presence Server    
   will remove subscriptions on expiry.

         SIP Combined Registration and Subscription         October 2002

5. Proxy UA

   The Proxy UA SHOULD send the new combined SIP REGISTER + SIP 
   SUBSCRIBE message to the SIP Registrar.
 
   It SHOULD also be capable of handling a NOTIFY message. It MAY use 
   the message to update its local database

6. Backward Compatibility

   The modification being proposed in this memo is backward compatible    
   since the header is being made optional in the SIP REGISTER message.   
   If the header is not present, the message is same as before, so the   
   SIP Registrar SHOULD behave as usual.

         SIP Combined Registration and Subscription         October 2002

   In the above flow, Proxy UA1 does a combined SIP Registration and    
   Subscription.  The expiration interval for both will be set by the   
   Expires header in the SIP REGISTER message. We can also use the tag    
   parameter with the Contact header, so that when the user moves from   
   one proxy to another, the tag parameter can be used to replace the    
   old contact addresses at the SIP Registrar. The SIP Registrar would   
   NOTIFY the old proxies of this change.
