1. Introduction and Background

1.1 Long-term and Short-term Internet Engineering Processes

Figure 1 illustrates the long-term and short-term Internet Engineering 
model for a network. Traditionally, Network Planning is used to build a 
physical network with static topology. Once a network is installed, it 
is expected to stay for a long period of time. Traffic Engineering is 
then used to optimize network resource utilization for traffic demands 
[TE-ash]. It is the optimization of network resources based on a fixed 
network topology. It allows traffic to utilize network resources in an 
efficient way. Network Planning is a long-term process to optimize 
network resources for long-term traffic growth, while Traffic 
Engineering is a short-term process to optimize network resources for 
short-term traffic fluctuation.

1.2 Conventional IP Traffic Engineering and Limitation

Traffic Engineering, in short, is putting traffic where the capacity is 
[ASTN-LN01]. This is contrasted with Network Engineering, which is 
establishing capacity where the traffic needs it.

[TE-FRWK] has a detailed definition of Internet Traffic Engineering. 
"Internet traffic engineering is defined as that aspect of Internet 
Network Engineering dealing with the issues of performance evaluation 
and performance optimization of operational IP networks. Traffic 
Engineering encompasses the application of technology and scientific 
principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and control 
of Internet traffic [rfc2702]."


Cheng et. al.                                                  [Page 3]

In traditional IP traffic engineering, the underlying network topology 
is assumed to be relatively static [rfc2702, te-MPLS-diff]. In 
particular, the links connecting the IP/MPLS routers in the backbone 
are typically provisioned for a long period of time, due to the 
difficulties of rapid reconfiguration of physical links.

The main objective of IP/MPLS traffic engineering is efficient mapping 
of traffic demands onto the network topology to maximize resource 
utilization while meeting QoS constraints such as delay and packet 
loss. The traffic demands may be obtained from measurement, projection, 
customer prospects, Service Level Agreement (SLA), or combination of 
the above. The mapping may be done in a multi-period fashion 
corresponding to diurnal or weekly patterns. In a MPLS network, the 
mapping is facilitated by establishing explicit label switched paths 
(LSP). In a connectionless IP network, the mapping can be attempted by 
adjusting IGP weights. 

The key assumption of current Internet Traffic Engineering is that the 
total network resources for IP routers to use are fixed. This 
assumption may be changed by leveraging configurable circuit-switched 
networks. Instead of a fixed amount of resources, the allocation of 
total network resources for IP routers can now be flexible. The IP 
network can get more resources from its provider network, which may be 
a transport network that carries IP traffic. It can also return 
resources to its provider network. The configurable circuit-switched 
network is a flexible transport network, which provides a flexible 
network resource pool. However, the resources (bandwidth, links, ports) 
of the pool are limited (if there were unlimited, there would be no 
point of switching). 

IP traffic has the following characteristics:
- IP traffic is variable-speed.
- IP traffic is bursty.
- Destination address is frequently changed (e.g., net surfing).
- A variety of QoS is needed depending on application.

A fixed topology with a fixed amount of bandwidth for Traffic 
Engineering does not offer sufficient flexibility to optimally deal 
with the characteristics mentioned above, because IP traffic 
characteristics change dynamically from moment to moment. The Network 
Engineering function described herein offers the potential to overcome 
this limitation via dynamic reconfiguration of links according to the 
status of the networks, a property that is supported by dynamically 
configurable circuit-switched networks.  


1.3 Layered Network 

Before we discuss the solutions that this paper identifies, we briefly 
discuss the notion of a layered network architecture. The concept of 
layering enables a separation between a network's logical topology and 
its physical routes and resources.  In particular, the process for 
setting up connections becomes generic to all layers.


Cheng et. al.                                                  [Page 4]

Layering refers to a logical decomposition of a network into a number 
of distinct layers, which have a well-defined set of associated 
characteristics.  A layer network may be defined in terms of a <rate, 
format>-tuple (or signal type). For example, STS-1 is a different layer 
network from STS-3c is a different layer network from STS-12c. 

Flexibility can occur at each of these layers, and is usually discussed 
in terms of a network's "switching" granularity. For example, an IP 
router's switching granularity is an IP packet; a SONET cross-connectÆs 
switching granularity might be an STS-1; a photonic cross-connect's 
switching granularity is a wavelength (optical channel). Figure 3 shows 
some switching hierarchies, where the highest is SDM (Space Division 
Multiplexing), the next one WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing), 
etc. 

There are different types of Network Elements (NEs) that can include 
components of different network layers depending on the targeted 
application (refer to Figure 2).

Another way of describing Network Engineering is that it is the process 
of obtaining connections from a provider network (note that in this 
discussion we make no assumption that the user and provider are from 
different organizations) in support of aggregates of traffic units 
(e.g., packets) in the user network.  When the resources of the 
provider network are switched 1:1 with the traffic units in the user 
network, then no Network Engineering function is involved.  

At this point, we should introduce and distinguish between the concepts 
of layering and aggregation. When layering involves an adaptation of 
more than one client signal into a server signal (i.e., multiplexing), 
then it is an aggregate of client signals and the layer relationship 
can be managed by Network Engineering.  When layering is an adaptation 
of a single client into a server signal (e.g., DS3 into STS-1) then it 
is not a spacial aggregate.  If it is also not a temporal aggregate 
then the server connections are set-up and torn down one-to-one with 
client traffic units, even though thereÆs a layering relationship 
between them. When there is no layering relationship, or when the 
client/server relationship is 1:1, there is no spacial aggregation, but 
there may still be temporal aggregation. Temporal aggregation is when 
one provider connection is kept up for the multiple user traffic units.  
Thus, Network Engineering is used to control spacial and/or temporal 
aggregates of traffic.

Another way to identify an aggregation boundary is to observe bandwidth 
time product (BTP) mismatches between traffic units in the user and 
provider network.  The BTP of the traffic units in the user network is 
of finer granularity than the BTP of the traffic units in the provider 
network. Multiple IP traffic units are interleaved in time into a 
single provider connection, and the holding time of an IP traffic unit 
is shorter than the holding time of an optical connection. Tearing down 
one or more IP associations may only result in the reduction of 
bandwidth utilization in an optical connection. Tearing down an optical 
connection can only be done if all carried user IP associations are 
terminated or re-routed through another optical connection.




Cheng et. al.                                                  [Page 6

Note that the establishment of an IP link usually incurs a certain cost 
to the user IP network. It is important that the cost is within a 
planned budget. This may involve re-optimization and tearing down some 
IP links. The provider network has limited resources, so it is 
important that the total value of the links established from the 
provider network is maximized.

As another consideration, databases of resources lower than OSI layer 3 
are traditionally easy to manage since those resources are mostly 
static and changed on a order-by-order basis. However, for configurable 
circuit-switched networks, where resources lower than layer 3 are 
dynamically changed, it brings a completely new paradigm in how to 
manage resource databases. Easy and manageable database systems are 
desired.



1.4 Conventional IP Network Planning and Limitations

In conventional IP network, static topology is normally set up at the 
network planning time according to the most stringent traffic demand 
patterns in a given duration. Because of forecasting mismatch and the 
inability of changing the network topology fast enough, Traffic 
Engineering limits itself to achieving higher network resource 
utilization. 

Observe that the static topology of the IP network introduces 
limitations. Consider first the case when traffic demands are well 
estimated a priori. In this case, provisioning needs to be done 
according to the most stringent traffic demand patterns in a given 
duration (even under the assumption that the best TE plan, which can 
take advantage of multi-period traffic patterns if used). Therefore, 
network resources remain under-utilized when traffic demands are light 
(e.g., during weekends or evenings) since provisioned links cannot be 
released easily.

When the traffic demands cannot be estimated accurately, network 
planning may not be done efficiently. For example, if link provisioning 
is inadequate, traffic demands can exceed the required network 
resources. This may occur because of forecasting mismatch or the 
inability of provisioning the network fast enough to meet the growth in 
resource requirements. On the other hand, it may be necessary to over-
provision the network due to the difficulties of forecasting the 
traffic growth accurately.

Furthermore, if the provisioning cycle (i.e., the time it takes to add 
resources to the network) is long, resource provisioning needs to take 
into account the projected traffic growth until the beginning of the 
next cycle. Consequently the extra network resources may be 
significantly under-utilized at the early part of a cycle if the 
projected growth is large.




Cheng et. al.                                                  [Page 7

With the advent of circuit-switched networks, the client IP networks 
can leverage the dynamic nature of the underlying transport topology. 
It can achieve higher network resource utilization by dynamically 
setting up and tearing down IP links in response to critical traffic 
conditions (e.g., overloaded ports, overloaded routers, etc.). This 
overcomes the limitation associated with Traffic Engineering, which is 
based on a given network topology.

Note that the leverage of a configurable circuit-switched network is 
complementary to the use of effective Traffic Engineering schemes for 
the IP/MPLS networks. Indeed, it is best to use an effective Traffic 
Engineering scheme to optimize the traffic distribution over the 
existing network resources before attempting to dynamically change the 
underlying transport network resources. We present a first-draft 
description of Internet Network Engineering functionality and 
capabilities to address the limitation of classic IP Traffic 
Engineering and Network Planning.


1.5 Terminology

In this section we present a glossary of terminology that we use in 
this paper and follow it up with a description of what we term ôNetwork 
Engineeringö as a solution.

Traffic Engineering û Putting traffic where the capacity is [ASTN-LN01].

Network Planning û Network Planning function makes decisions on 
installing fiber and Network Equipment (NE) for a network based on 
forecast long-term traffic demands.

Network Engineering û Establishing capacity where the traffic needs it.

Link-connection û one channel between subnetworks. That is to say one 
unit of capacity between subnetworks. A link connection may or may not 
be carrying traffic.

Link û a set of all link connections between a pair of subnetworks that 
are equivalent for the purposes of routing. This definition allows a 
link to have zero link connections.

An IP link û a unidirectional physical connection between two IP 
routers. Note that usually IP links are bi-directional. Any request for 
a bi-directional link can then be accomplished by two requests, each 
for an uni-directional link. It could be an optical network connection 
through the underlying circuit switched network. In this case, an IP 
router has logical adjacency with its IP router peer and physical 
adjacency with the circuit switch that it is connected to.

A configurable IP link-connection û an IP link, which can be 
dynamically setup and released within the circuit-switched layer, thus 
may actively change the IP network topology.



Cheng et. al                                                   [Page 8

A non-configurable IP link-connection û an IP link, which cannot be 
dynamically setup and released within the circuit-switched layer.

User Network û an IP network, which can request for dynamical setup and 
release a link within the circuit-switched Network.

Provider Network û a circuit-switched network, which can dynamically 
setup and release a link for the user network.

Capacity û The ability of a link or link connection to carry traffic; 
this doesnÆt imply the traffic is present or not present.

Traffic û the presence of traffic in the capacity of a link or link 
connection. 

Overloaded port û A port which has more traffic than the port capacity

Overloaded router û An IP router which has no more port capacity for 
additional traffic

Configurability û the ability of the IP layer to add a link, delete a 
link, and modify the parameter(s) of a link.

2. Network Engineering 

In this section, we will elaborate 
- ôWhyö a network needs a Network Engineering function, which serves 
as the motivation of our work,
- ôWhatö Network Engineering is,
- ôHowö a Network Engineering function adds, deletes, modifies 
circuit-switched links,
- ôWhenö to activate a Network Engineering function, and 
- ôWhereö in the network the NE modifies the user network topology via 
modifying circuit-switched link configurations.



2.1 Why 

How can Traffic Engineering, which was designed for static topology, 
cope with conventional dynamic network topology? We will introduce 
here, Network Engineering, to dynamically ôadjustö network topology for 
the traditional Traffic Engineering. The network topology considered by 
the Network Engineering function consists of a user network and a 
provider network. Hence, it is a logical network topology.

Figure 4 illustrates the engineering hierarchy of Internet Engineering 
Processes for a network to satisfy traffic demands from both short-term 
and long-term perspectives.

Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 10]

We consider a network consisting of a set of IP routers that are inter-
connected either through fixed links or through a set of circuit 
switches. That is, there are two logical layers, i.e., IP layer and the 
underlying circuit-switched layer. These two logical layers interact in 
a user-provider relationship. The circuit-switched layer can be thought 
of as merely providing dynamically configurable links for the user 
network. 

To address the short-term fluctuation of more/less capacity needs for 
traffic demands, the Network Engineering function takes/deletes more 
links from the provider network, in a near real-time fashion. It is a 
function defines how the user network uses the provider network. It 
changes the logical user network topology by adding/deleting circuit-
switched links. It supports better and flexible network topology for a 
classic Traffic Engineering function, without having to change existing 
Traffic Engineering functions.



2.2 What 

Network Engineering is a part of a larger Network Planning function, 
which makes decisions on installing fiber and Network Equipment (NE) 
for a network based on forecast traffic demands. The user network and 
the provider network will have independent Network Planning processes. 
The computation for Network Planning is typically done offline since it 
involves searching on multi-dimensional solution spaces for long-term 
traffic growth. Network Engineering (NE) is an automation of the part 
of Network Planning of the user network that can be supported from a 
provider network. NE provides a more real-time topology changes 
according to existing and near-term traffic demands. It assists current 
Traffic Engineering function to better optimize the network resource 
utilization via topology changes.

Network Engineering that we describe here can be thought of as an 
automatic network provisioning procedure. It is to allocate/de-allocate 
provider network resources to be used by the user network. In other 
words, the intent of Network Engineering is to put the capacity where 
it is needed by the traffic. Or conversely, to remove the capacity 
where the traffic has diminished. 

Internet Network Engineering process is concerned with the management 
of the (virtual) links in the IP network based on the traffic demands 
that are expected between any two routers in the network (pro-active) 
and the actual traffic demands (re-active). The fundamental issue is 
design, ranking, and choice of an IP link, which is to be established 
by the circuit-switched layer.

It is also worth being able to calculate the number of current open 
connections and the maximum number of open connections allowed (due to 
limits in capacity). Network Engineering may also add a link or modify  
a link (via adding or deleting link connections) on request of a 
traffic engineering process (if compliant with policy), which is not 
able to complete a connection in the absence of available bandwidth. 


Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 11]

2.3 How 

To data network, conventional transport networks are "static". They are 
provisioned as leased line services. Classic IP TE considers a fixed IP 
layer topology. 

A distributed transport control plane can provide an on-demand 
automatic choice and configuration of underlying circuits to be used in 
the IP layer. The new control plane of the transport network transforms 
the "dummy pipes" into a foundation for switched connection services, a 
service platform that can provide an automatic link provisioning 
function rather than simple transmission. This new function enables 
numerous network services.

This new paradigm of adding and deleting capacity of the transport 
network has profound impacts on conventional data networking. It 
changes the data network's basic assumption that the transport network 
consists of fixed pipes, i.e., a static network. In the new paradigm, 
the transport network can be considered as a configurable backbone. 
Packet switches can dynamically adjust the network topology according 
to end network traffic to optimize overall network performance. 

Much effort has been devoted to the control plane design. That is, 
ôhowö to automatically provision a link. Note that Network Engineering 
considers user link configuration within a provider domain, hence the 
choice of the signaling protocol, which will carry parameters needed 
for a Network Engineering function, is not relevant for the time being. 

Our work, on the other hand, focuses on ôwhenö and ôwhereö to 
automatically provision a link. In this sense, this work complements 
the work that is progressing in the CCAMP working group and sub-IP area 
in general.



2.4 When

In order to change the logical network topology, Network Engineering 
has some basic operations, which include adding a link, deleting a 
link, and modifying a link from the circuit-switched layer. We will 
elaborate these NE operations in detail later in section 3.6.

Network Engineering also monitors the layered network to determine 
- when a new link (or link connection) should be added to the IP 
network, 
- when an existing link (or link connection) should be modified (i.e. 
increased or reduced), or 
- when a link (or link connection) should be released. 

Network Engineering is a new functional module in addition to 
conventional Traffic Engineering. This function is independent of any 
network models (e.g., peers, overlay, or augmented)). 



Cheng at. al.                                                 [Page 12

When should a Network Engineering be invoked to perform the 
aforementioned operations? We will define a set of trigger mechanisms 
to invoke the Network Engineering function in section 3.4.



2.5 Where

The connection resources available from the provider network are 
limited. Network Engineering must choose where the most beneficial 
links to add (or to delete/modify). Network Engineering should also 
monitor the bandwidth demands from a source/destination relationship in 
order to identify the traffic patterns in the network. Where necessary, 
a user network's topology can be optimized by e.g. adding direct links 
between two heavily overloaded nodes. Decisions are taken based on the 
SLA between the user and the provider and the policies set by the 
provider network operators. 

We will address how Network Engineering optimally choosing ôwhereö to 
add/delete/modify links in section 3.5 (Decision-Making Process).

3. Architectural Element of Network Engineering 

3.1 Architectural Overview

Figure 5 shows an architecture for Network Engineering. A decision-
making functional module is triggered by some triggering mechanisms 
(e.g., proactive input or reactive input), and takes the current 
network status (e.g., traffic information and topology information) to 
compute the output. 

The input of the Network Engineering process is the current measured 
state of the user network. Proactive information makes possible traffic 
shaping for particular purposes, e.g., busy hour, network overload 
threshold, etc. The proactive mechanism might also use the bandwidth 
advertising from the circuit network in order to pre-estimate the links 
to establish. The bandwidth advertising might be invoked periodically. 
Reactive information can trigger the establishment of new links upon 
measured performance.

The output of the Network Engineering phase is a target IP link, which 
can be configured as a switched circuit. In other words, the result of 
the Network Engineering is to add a link, delete a link, or modify 
parameters of a link (i.e., via adding/deleting link connections).

                Figure 5 Network Engineering Architecture



3.2 Traffic Information

An IP network has network internal information and network external 
information, that can be applied to proactively or reactively 
triggering an IP Network Engineering function. 






Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 14]

The network internal information deals with the traffic statistics 
collected over a certain period of time, based on which particular 
traffic flows can be established according to the predictable traffic 
patterns. The internal information can also trigger the reconfiguration 
of the existing traffic patterns (i.e., Traffic Engineering) for more 
efficient service-level guarantees or network throughput. If this 
fails, then Network Engineering is attempted. This information is 
reactive but can be also used predictively by assuming cyclic traffic 
patterns.

The network-external information deals with edge-to-edge traffic 
requests. If such a request identifies an amount of resources that is 
needed to assess the need for new IP links. This information can be 
neither estimated nor measured with complete accuracy. An example of 
such information might be a new contract or a new traffic request. In 
this case, for example, the predictable traffic patterns as defined by 
the long-term traffic measurements have to be revised. 

Traffic statistics maybe stationary or non-stationary. For stationary 
traffic statistics data, using periodically sampled data to construct a 
probability distribution function (PDF) may be useful. This PDF 
function is then a good input to the Network Engineering function. For 
non-stationary traffic, more data (e.g., bandwidth utilization, etc.) 
is needed to perform the Network Engineering function.

Examples of internal information are: packet loss [rfc2680], router 
overload, and port overload [newsome01]. Examples of external 
information are: SLA violations, or new SLAs. Such information triggers 
the network design to automatically configure an IP link. Depending on 
the triggering information, configuration can be adding, deleting 
circuit links, or modifying existing traffic parameters.

Both external and internal information may result in connection 
requests. The network-internal information are obtained based on the 
measurements within the user network, and the network-external 
information can be estimated based on the service contract information 
related to the new traffic.



3.3 Network Topology Information

3.3.1 IP Network Topology Information

In order to perform Network Engineering function, IP routers need to 
have the following topology information:

(1) IP routes
These are conventional routes to IP peers. They are standard IP routes 
to various destinations learned through conventional IGPs (e.g., ISIS 
or OSPF) and EGPs (e.g., BGP).



Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 15]

(2) Forwarding Adjacencies (FA)
Forwarding Adjacencies are IP (i.e., Layer 3) neighbors that are 
connected by an underlying circuit-LSP through a provider network. 
These connections are dynamic in nature and can be set up and torn down 
as needed. 

Both IP routes and Forwarding Adjacencies are used for packet 
forwarding. Such information is disseminated using IGP or EGP routing 
protocols. A provider network treats traffic carrying this kind of 
information as user traffic. 

(3) Potential FAs (PFA)
PFAs are remote CAGs [BGP/GMPLS]. They represent NEs that belong to the 
same client network or to different client networks, which allow NEs in 
the local network to connect to it. The NEs represented by a PFA are 
not connected yet but can be connected via the provider network. Such a 
connection is a direct connection at the IP layer with an underlying 
circuit connection that spans multiple ASÆs. 

Information about PFAs can be disseminated through BGP extensions in 
the provider network, directory service, or yellow page mechanisms.

(4) Accessible IP Routes through the PFAs
This provides information about all the IP routers reachable through a 
PFA endpoint. Such information can be used for the IP Network 
Engineering function to determine the source and destination of the  
circuit connections.

Although this document does not address the issue of how this 
information is disseminated, we note here that various options exist 
for doing so. These options include dissemination through established 
user network connections or a dedicated user network control plane 
network. 



3.3.2 Server Network Topology Information

For the purpose of IP Network Engineering, it understands the IP 
network topology, and does not require circuit network topology 
information to compute the output. Since it does not require network 
topology information, Network Engineering is independent of any network 
models. Existing network models are all able to support a Network 
Engineering function.







Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 16]

3.4 Triggering Mechanisms

There is a set of triggering mechanisms, which defines ôwhenö to 
activate the Network Engineering function. 	

1. Direct user request û User should be able to request a Network 
Engineering function. For example, an operator may need to do on-
line or off-line capacity planning or business modeling for his 
network. Network Engineering provides a most efficient network 
topology as a basic standing point for Traffic Engineering to 
consider.	

2. Response to adding a link û It is among Network Engineering 
capability to add a link to the network. The request maybe a result 
of future Network Planning of the network or an unexpected traffic 
loads. Such a request can	also come from Traffic Engineering.	

3. Response to deleting a link û It is among Network Engineering 
capability to delete a link from the network. The request maybe a 
result of future planning to an expected reduced traffic loads. Also 
such a request can come from Traffic Engineering.	

4. Response to modifying a link û It is among Network Engineering 
capability to modify a link to the network. If the request is to 
increase the capacity of a link, it maybe a result of future 
planning of the network or an unexpected traffic loads. If the 
request is to decrease the capacity of a link, it maybe a result of 
future planning or reduced traffic loads.	

5. Congestion condition û Congestion problem is probably one of the 
most studied problems in contemporary Internet networks. When a 
congestion condition is not properly handled, it will significantly 
degrade network performance. Traffic Engineering should be able to 
detect a congestion condition and re-engineers the network. Upon its 
limit, then activate Network Engineering function.	
 
6. Router overload û Upon a router overload condition, it is desirable 
to find an alternative route for traffic to bypass the overloaded 
router.

7. Link overload û Upon a link overload condition, it is desirable to 
add more capacity parallel to the congested link. If this is not 
feasible, it is desirable to increase capacity over a different 
route and redirect some of the existing traffic to the newly added 
link to relief the overloaded condition. However, this has to be 
done carefully as existing traffic should not get all redirected on 
the newly added link, leading to a mere shift in the location of the 
link overload condition.	

8. Maintenance û In the maintenance phase, it is also desirable to run 
Network Engineering function.	

9. Failure û Upon a failure situation (e.g., link failure, network 
failure, etc.), it is desirable to run Network Engineering function.	

Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 17]

10. Routine û If none of the above condition occurs, it is desirable 
to run the Network Engineering function on a regular basis. 
Routinely running Network Engineering function can insure that the 
network is making the most efficient use of it network resources. 
The interval of the routine depends on the network sizes and traffic 
loads of the network.



3.5 The Decision Making Process

The decision-making process decides ôwhereö to add/delete/modify 
circuit-switched links.

The Network Engineering decision making module will be involved in the 
path computation depending on the knowledge of the layered network. The 
problem of selecting a new link that best satisfies demands for 
bandwidth is a multi-dimensional optimization problem, i.e. one that is 
mathematically "hard" and probably not possible to compute perfectly, 
even in principle. This problem can be decomposed into two parts: link 
design, and link choice. The design phase identifies a set of links 
that would satisfy some needs; whereas the choice phase chooses a final 
set of links based on maximizing the total value.

First of all, link design provides a set of potential links that meets 
the following criteria:

1. links that are configurable in the circuit-switched layer (e.g., 
with free ports, and free capacities), and

2. links that has enough capacity to meet traffic demands. 

During the design phase, we distinguish different types of links based 
on the number of hops the link bridges. The output of link design can 
be zero or more candidate links to be ôconfiguredö (e.g., add, delete, 
modify) in the circuit-switched layer. If no link is selected, it means 
blocking in the circuit layer. This can be unavailable ports or 
insufficient capacity.


Secondly in the choice phase, a set of criteria, for choosing a final 
link amongst a set of candidate links, is needed. The criteria are 
based on the consideration of bandwidth, distance, and duration. Link 
choice ranks the set of potential links, selected from the above link 
design, according to the following set of parameters:

1. number of hops bridged,

2. bandwidth utilization of the new link,

3. value (or more correctly, rate of return on investment),
 
4. number of switched-ports spared, or

5. etc.

Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 18]
It then requests the reduced set of maximum value from the potential 
links. One implication of the link choice is that a link design may get 
refused for reasons of insufficient value.

The value of any link requested can be expressed by 

1. multiple attributes (as listed for link choice) or 

2. a single metric function of multiple parameters (e.g. bandwidth, 
time, distance, etc.). That is, a single valued function of the 
parameters.


To avoid the problems of multi-dimensional optimization as described 
above, a single metric can be chosen as precedent, based on which a 
choice is made if all other requirements are satisfied. 

Administrative policies, constraints, directives, and guidance can also 
be weighted and contributed to the single metric. Some will be simple 
boolean, go-nogo parameters, so if we're converting to cost, nogo 
parameters might have to be represented as an infinite cost value to 
force rejection of the option.

Other parameters can be given weights and factored in to the single 
metric for the multi-dimensional tradeoffs. So far we have been 
focussing on shortest-path costing only, but we realize that Network 
Engineering must support additional administrative inputs.

Within the circuit layer a choice between candidate switched circuits 
can be made for the IP network in order to have the maximum advantages 
of a dynamic configuration. All circuits, which may be configured, are 
expected to be within the bounds requested by the IP layer, otherwise 
the request is rejected.



3.6 Link Operations

As we have mentioned earlier, in order to change the network topology, 
Network Engineering has to be able to add, delete, modify circuit-
switched links. We distinguish the following four types of link 
operations:

(1) add a link
	
Adding a link is to add a potential route with zero capacity. This type 
of link bridges two or more hops of existing IP links. Note that it 
changes the IP network topology without adding new capacity. Routing 
tables will need to be updated.	

Consider an IP (user) over an circuit (provider) network, where traffic 
flows from the source node A to the destination node Z. The following 
figure shows adding a new link p-s.	

Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 19]


A      p      q      r      s       Z	
O------O......O......O......O-------O
       :....................:

 
(2) add a link connection

Adding a link connection is to increase the capacity of an existing 
link. This new link (connection) bridges a single hop of IP link. It 
parallels an existing link and increases capacity of this link without 
changing the network topology. The following figure shows adding a new 
link connection r-s to an existing circuit-switched link r-s.	

A      p      q      r       s       Z	
O------O......O......O:::::::O-------O
       

(3) delete a link connection
		
This operation is only allowed when the traffic of that link connection 
is zero. Deleting a link connection is to decrease the capacity of a 
link. It may reduce the capacity of a link to zero.	


(4) delete a link

This operation is only allowed when the number of link connections in 
the link is zero. That is, when the capacity of the link is zero. To 
delete a link means to remove a potential route with zero capacity.


For the purpose of Network Engineering, if we need a new link with some 
capacity, we need to add a link (with zero capacity), and then add a 
new link connection to increase the capacity of this new link. If we 
need to delete a link, we will need to delete all the link connections 
in that link before deleting the link.
















Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 20]

4 Network Engineering and Traffic Engineering - A Closed-Loop Relation 

This section illustrates a closed-loop relationship between Network 
Engineering and Traffic Engineering processes (Figure 6). A closed-loop 
link provisioning process would automatically configure circuits in the 
circuit-switched network [close-loop, oif-197]. The cycle is closed 
because changes in bandwidth or topology affect the state of the user 
network.

A user network may consist of multiple sub-networks. For the purpose of 
discussion the relationship between Network Engineering and Traffic 
Engineering, we treat these sub-networks as one user-network. Hence the 
ôuser networkö in Figure 5 can be single or multiple sub-network. We do 
not wish to further complicate our discussion here.





Cheng et. al.                                                 [Page 21

Note that in Figure 5, Traffic Engineering still performs its function 
without having to interact with Network Engineering. Traffic 
Engineering gets traffic demands and optimally maps them into the 
existing network topology. Upon reaching the Traffic Engineering limit 
when traffic problems occur (e.g., insufficient capacity, etc.), 
Traffic Engineering then turns the problem to Network Engineering for 
dynamic topology reconfiguration. Network Engineering can also be run 
routinely.

Traffic Engineering mainly decides ôwhenö to use Network Engineering. 
Network Engineering computes ôwhereö to change the topology.



5. Summary

In this paper, we have outlined an early draft for an Internet Network 
Engineering framework. Traffic problems, which occur due to the 
limitations of Traffic Engineering, can trigger Network Engineering 
processes to further optimize the network performance. Network 
Engineering is to automatically select a link for addition, deletion, 
and modification to address Traffic Engineering limitation. Network 
Engineering and Traffic Engineering form a closed-loop process to 
optimize the network resources.

We also note that the specific choice of technologies is not essential 
to a Network Engineering process. It is important to recognize the 
problem is recursive. The closed-loop process for Network Engineering 
and Traffic Engineering is applicable to any user-provider relationship 
networks.



6. Security Issues

This document raises no new security concerns for MPLS signaling.
