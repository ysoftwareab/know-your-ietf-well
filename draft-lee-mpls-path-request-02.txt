Abstract

   This memo specifies the interface between an entity requesting an
   explicit route between two end-points (Path Query Entity) and another
   entity computing the explicit route (Path Computation Entity)

1.1 SUMMARY

   The draft describes a scalable approach, using a path query
   message/signalling to obtain constrained routes (including diverse
   routes) in a flat network(eg single area) or multiple hierarchy
   networks (e.g multiple areas in OSPF). Without a similar approach, in
   order to compute diverse routes spanning multiple areas, either TE
   LSAs are flooded in the whole AS (all areas) or all the TE LSAs must
   be downloaded from all areas. The approach describes in this draft
   allows a router to query routers (e.g.  Area Border Routers), which
   have the TE link state information necessary to compute the disjoint
   route. A router may also query another router within an area if it is
   not capable of doing certain path computation or if it does not have
   the required information to compute a constrained route within an
   area.

1.4 WHY IS IT TARGETED AT THIS WG

   >From the charter of TE-WG:  "The working group also serves as a
   general forum for discussing improvements to IETF protocols to
   advance the traffic engineering function.

   The working group may also consider the problems of traffic
   engineering across autonomous systems boundaries."

   This draft belongs in CCAMP as one of the needed protocol extensions
   for multi-area te, as called for by the requirements, [hierarchy-
   restoration-requirements].

   The draft provides a means to obtain constrained route in a scalable
   manner within an area and in multiple areas, enabling diverse route
   computation in multiple areas and improving the scalability of the TE
   function, in general. The approach is also applicable to TE across
   AS.

1.5 JUSTIFICATION

   There were discussions in the TE WG about this draft. The consensus
   was such a mechanism is required. Some suggestions on the list were
   to modify existing protocols (e.g SNMP, COPS, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP, BGP)
   for this mechanism. The authors have looked into some of the
   suggested protocols and is updating the draft on this issue.  In
   addition, http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ash-ccamp-multi-
   area-te-reqmts-00.  txt describes initial requirements for protocol
   support of multi-area TE of which a query functionality such as the
   one described in this draft is required.



2. Overview

   This memo specifies the interface between an entity requesting an
   explicit route between two end-points (Path Query Entity) and another
   entity providing the explicit route (Path Computation Entity) These
   entities may reside on the same node or on different nodes in a
   network.  The end-points may be the source or destination in the path
   or the intermediate points (eg the end-points of a segment of the
   path) in the path.



      ====================   Request an explicit route   ==============
      | Path Computation |  <-------------------------   | Path Query |
      | Entity           |                               | Entity     |
      |                  |  -------------------------->  |            |
      ===================   Return an explicit route     ==============
                                object

   This interface is required by a node e.g a Label Edge Router (LER)
   which does not have all the constraint information required to
   compute an explicit path to the destination. For instance to
   establish a route across different areas or network boundaries, an
   LER may query the transit border router (which has the constraint
   information to the destination or for at least part of the way to the
   destination). The transit border router computes and return the
   explicit routes satisfying the set of specified constraints.

   If the constraint aggregated routes from another area or network is
   not available the transit border router for the shortest path to the
   destination, is queried.  If the constraint aggregated routes from
   another network area is available, the transit border router for the
   constraint path may be queried.

   The transit border router may recurse this query for the constraint
   explicit path to the next transit border router to the destination.
   If a border router recurses this query, it should concatenate the
   explicit routes returned by the next transit border router to the
   explicit routes that it computed, before sending the explicit path to
   the querier. [Note: A border router (eg inter-domain) may choose to
   return a loose segment instead and may cache the explicit route in
   its domain to facilitate the subsequent path setup or it may expand
   the loose segment during path setup. This is FFS]


3. Path Request and Reply Message

   A one time client query and server response message is used here.
   This draft describes the TLVs required for the Path Request and Reply
   Message. The Path Request message is encapsulated in TCP, the
   destination address is set to the path computing entity IP address
   and the port number is set to a value that is being reserved for this
   purpose.  It should be noted that the TLVs described here can be
   adapted for specific protocols (such as COPS, SNMP, RSVP-TE, CR-LDP
   or BGP MPLS)

   The messages are: Path Request Message and Path Reply Message.
   Existing TLVs already defined in various drafts are used here.  The
   new TLV added is : Discrete Bandwidth Required TLV Other optional
   TLVs will be defined in future.

3.1 Path Request Message

   A Path Query Entity sends a Path Request Message, encapsulated in a
   TCP header to the Path Computation Entity.

   The Path Request Message contains the following mandatory fields:

   The encoding for the Path Request message is:

          0                   1                   2                   3

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |                     Optional TLVs                             |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Message ID - 32-bit value used to identify this message.

   Source Address - the source end of the path or the segment specified
   by the ER-Hop TLV defined in [CR-LDP] [Note: source, destination may
   refer to intermediate points in a path, eg the end-points of a loose
   segment of a path]

   Destination address - the destination end of the path or the segment
   specified by the ER-Hop TLV

   Multiple Source and Destination Address TLV pairs may be specified.

   The Path Request Message may contain the following optional fields:

   Traffic Parameters TLV, as specified in [CR-LDP]

   Resource Class TLV (4 octets)  - as defined in [OSPF-TE-EXT]

   Encoding Type TLV (4 octets) - defined as Bandwidth Encoding in
   [GEN-MPLS]

   Disjoint Route TLV (variable length) - contain one or more ER-TLV

3.2 Path Reply Message

   The Route Response Message returns a set of explicit route.  Multiple
   ER-TLVs may be returned.  The explicit route returned is as defined
   in [CR-LDP] - the Explicit Route TLV (ER-TLV) and consists of
   Explicit Hop TLV (ER-Hop TLV)

          0                   1                   2                   3

         |                     ER-TLV                                    |

4. Additional TLVs
4.1 Number of Disjoint Paths TLV

   The specifies the number of disjoint paths requested.

   The format for the Number of Disjoint Paths TLV is:

         0                   1                   2                   3

         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |0|0|  # Disjoint Paths TLV     |           Length              |
         | | |      (0x0850)             |                               |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |#  Disjoint    |                                               |
         |Paths Requested|        Reserved                               |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


4.2 Disjoint Route TLV

   This specifies that the path requested should not traverse the route
   specified in the Disjoint Route TLV, an enhanced ER-TLV.  Multiple
   ER-TLVs may be included if desired.  A bit in the Reserved field in
   the ER-Hop is allocated to indicate that the ER-Hop should not be
   used in the path computation. If this bit is set, the 'L' bit should
   be ignored.
