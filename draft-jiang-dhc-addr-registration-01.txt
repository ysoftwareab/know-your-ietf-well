Abstract 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, host self-generated 
   addresses are notionally conflicted with the network managed address 
   architecture. These addresses need to be registered in the networking 
   management plate for the purposes of central address administration. 
   This document introduces a generic address registration solution 
   using DHCPv6, and defines one new ND option and three new DHCPv6 
   options.

1. Introduction & Requirements 

   In the IPv6 address allocation scenarios, there are many host self-
   generated addresses, such as addresses in IPv6 Stateless Address 
   Configuration [RFC4862, RFC4941] scenario and Cryptographically 
   Generated Addresses (CGA, [RFC3972]), and etc. These addresses are 
   notionally conflicted with the network managed address architecture, 
   such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6, 
   [RFC3315]) managed network or network with Access Control List. 

   Many operators of enterprise networks and similarly tightly 
   administered networks have expressed the desire to be at least aware 
   the hosts' addresses when moving to IPv6. Furthermore, they may want 
   to stop the usage of some hosts' addresses for various reasons. 

   A useful way to give network administrators most of what they want, 
   while at the same time retaining compatibility with normal stateless 
   configuration would be: if the self-generated IPv6 addresses are  
   used, they may need to be registered in and granted by the networking 
   management plate. The host may be required to perform this 
   registration since only granted IPv6 addresses are allowed to be used 
   to access the network. 

   In order to fulfill the abovementioned practice, this document 
   introduces a new Neighbor Discovery (ND) option and a new DHCPv6 
   option to propagate the address registration solicitation from 
   network management to hosts. DHCPv6 protocol is suitable to perform 
   the address registration procedure while DHCPv6 servers play as the 
   address registration server. Two new DHCPv6 options are defined, the 
   Address Registration Request Option and the Address Registration 
   Acknowledgement Option. 

2. Terminology 

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [RFC2119]. 

3. Overview of Generic Address Registration Solution 

   By current default, the hosts with self-generated addresses do not 
   register their addresses to any network devices. However, this may 
   result that the network may reject the access request from these 
   devices.

   As showed in below Figure 1, in the generic address registration 
   solution, proposed by this document, the network management plate 
   firstly propagates the solicitations of registering self-generated 
   addresses, by messages from either local router (step 1a in Figure 1) 
   or DHCPv6 server (step 1b in Figure 1). 

   By received such solicitations, a host using the self-generated 
   address SHOULD send an address registration request message to the 
   network management (step 2 in Figure 1). The network management MAY 
   check whether the requested address is accepted, for example, 
   checking the address does not use the Reserved IPv6 Interface 
   Identifiers [RFC5453]. If the requested address is accepted by the 
   network management, it is registered in the address database, which 
   MAY be used by other network functions, such as DNS or ACL, etc. An 
   acknowledgement is sent to the host, granting the usage of this 
   address (step 3 in Figure 1). If the requested address is not 
   accepted by the network management, a rejected acknowledgement is 
   sent to the host to indicate that it SHOULD generate a new address.

4. Propagating the Address Registration Solicitation with Prefix 
   Assignment 

   In order to indicate or force the hosts with self-generated addresses 
   to register their addresses and the appointed address registration 
   server, new solicitation options need to be defined. 

   There are more than one mechanism in which configuration parameters 
   could be pushed to the end hosts. The address registration 
   solicitation option can be carried in Router Advertisement (RA)

   message, which is broadcasted by local routers. In the DHCPv6 managed 
   network, it can also be carried in DHCPv6 messages. 

   By receiving the address registration solicitation option(s), a host 
   SHOULD register its self-generated addresses, if there are any, to 
   the appointed registration server. The solicitation options may 
   include the IPv6 address(es) of address registration server. 

   In principle, hosts must receive a prefix from either RA message 
   [RFC4861] or DHCPv6 message [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id] so that they 
   can generate an IPv6 address by themselves. The Address Registration 
   Solicitation options could be propagated together with prefix 
   assignment information. 

4.1. ND Address Registration Solicitation Option 

   The ND Address Registration Solicitation Option allows routers to 
   propagate the solicitation for hosts to register their self-generated 
   address. This option also carries an IPv6 address of the default 
   address registration server. This option SHOULD be propagated 
   together with ND Prefix Information Option, Section 4.6.2, [RFC4861]. 
   The format of the ND Address Registration Solicitation Option is 
   described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               + 
       |                                                               | 
       +                        Address (Address                       + 
       |                      Registration Server)                     | 
       +                                                               + 
       |                                                               | 
       +                               +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
       |                               |                               | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+                               + 
       |                           Reserved                            | 
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 

       [Open Question to WG] Should the new ND option carry IPv6 address 
       of the default address registration server? Or this can be 
       discovered by DHCPv6 discovery mechanism. Should we design a mark 
       bit for the scenario that ND does NOT appoint an address 
       registration server? Should we use FQDN instead of Address? 
       Multiple address registration servers?

         Reserved   Padding bits. For future use also. The value MUST 
                  be initialized to zero by the sender, and MUST be 
                  ignored by the receiver. 

4.2. DHCPv6 Address Registration Solicitation Option 

   The DHCPv6 Address Registration Solicitation Option allows DHCPv6 
   server to propagate the solicitation for hosts to register their 
   self-generated address. Assuming the DHCPv6 server itself is the 
   address registration server, this option does NOT carries the IPv6 
   address of the default address registration server. This option 
   SHOULD be propagated together with DHCPv6 Prefix Information Option, 
   Section 5, [I-D.ietf-dhc-host-gen-id]. The format of the DHCPv6 
   Address Registration Solicitation Option is described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       option-code     OPTION_Addr_Reg_Solicitation (TBA2). 

       option-len      0. length of this option in octets (option-code 
                         and option-len are not included). 

        [Open Question to WG: is 0 allowed?] 

5. DHCPv6 Address Registration Options 

   The current DHCPv6 protocol is reused as the address registration 
   protocol while a DHCPv6 serve plays as address registration server. 
   Two new DHCPv6 options, the Address Registration Request Option and 
   the Address Registration Acknowledgement Option, are defined in this 
   section in order to fulfill the address registration interactions.

5.1. DHCPv6 Address Registration Request Option 

   A new DHCPv6 Address Registration Request Option is defined in order 
   to carry the requested address from hosts to the address registration 
   server. The format of the DHCPv6 Address Registration Request Option 
   is described as follows: 

        0                   1                   2                   3

       option-len      16. length of this option in octets (option-code 
                         and option-len are not included). 

       Address        128-bit requested IPv6 address, which generated 
                    by the host 

   By received, the DHCPv6 server MAY check whether the requested 
   address is accepted, for example, checking the address does not use 
   the Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers [RFC5453]. If the requested 
   address is accepted, the DHCPv6 server MUST register it in the 
   address database, which MAY be used by other network functions, such 
   as DNS or ACL, etc. A DCHPv6 reply message with the below-defined 
   Acknowledgement Option is sent back to the host for notification. 

   [Open Question to WG] Should we ack only when address is rejected or 
   both accepted and rejected? 

5.2. DHCPv6 Address Registration Acknowledgement Option 

   In order to response to registration requests, an acknowledgement 
   DHCPv6 option is also defined below. It is used to indicate whether 
   the registration of an IPv6 address is accepted. The format of the 
   DHCPv6 Address Registration Acknowledgement Option is described as 
   follows:

                      address. 

   An acknowledgement is sent to the host, granting the usage of this 
   address (step 3 in Figure 1). If the requested address is not 
   accepted by the network management, a rejected acknowledgement is 
   sent to the host to indicate that it SHOULD generate a new address. 

6. Security Considerations 

   An attacker may use a faked address registration request option to 
   indicate hosts reports their address to a malicious server and 
   collect the user information. These attacks may be prevented by using 
   Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND, [RFC3971]) if RA Address

   An attacker could generate IPv6 address registration requests in 
   order to exhaust the server resources (or to impact on any other 
   operation that depend on the registration of the address). 

   The DHCPv6 address registration procedure is as vulnerable as all 
   other mechanisms based on DHCPv6 to DOS attacks to the server. Proper 
   use of DHCPv6 autoconfiguration facilities [RFC3315], such as AUTH 
   option or Secure DHCP [I-D.ietf-dhc-secure-dhcpv6] can prevent these 
   threats. 

7. IANA Considerations 

   This document defines a new Neighbor Discovery [RFC4861] option, 
   which MUST be assigned Option Type values within the option numbering 
   space for Neighbor Discovery Option Type: 

       The Address Registration Solicitation Option (TBA1), described in 
       Section 4.1. 

   This document defines two new DHCPv6 [RFC3315] options, which MUST be 
   assigned Option Type values within the option numbering space for 
   DHCPv6 options: 

       The OPTION_Addr_Reg_Solicitation (TBA2), described in  
       Section 4.2; 

       The OPTION_Addr_Registration_Request (TBA3), described in Section 
       5.1; 

       The OPTION_Addr_Registration_Ack (TBA4), described in  
       Section 5.2.
