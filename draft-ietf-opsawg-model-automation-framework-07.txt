  A Framework for Automating Service and Network Management with YANG
            draft-ietf-opsawg-model-automation-framework-07

Abstract

   Data models provide a programmatic approach to represent services and
   networks.  Concretely, they can be used to derive configuration
   information for network and service components, and state information
   that will be monitored and tracked.  Data models can be used during
   the service and network management life cycle, such as service
   instantiation, provisioning, optimization, monitoring, diagnostic,
   and assurance.  Data models are also instrumental in the automation
   of network management, and they can provide closed-loop control for
   adaptive and deterministic service creation, delivery, and
   maintenance.

   This document describes an architecture for service and network
   management automation that takes advantage of YANG modeling
   technologies.  This architecture is drawn from a network operator
   perspective irrespective of the origin of a data model; it can thus
   accommodate modules that are developed outside the IETF.

1.  Introduction

   Service management systems usually comprise service activation/
   provision and service operation.  Current service delivery
   procedures, from the processing of customer's requirements and orders
   to service delivery and operation, typically assume the manipulation
   of data sequentially into multiple Operations Support System (OSS) or
   Business Support System (BSS) applications that may be managed by
   different departments within the service provider's organization
   (e.g., billing factory, design factory, network operation center).
   In addition, many of these applications have been developed in-house
   over the years and operate in a silo mode:

   o  The lack of standard data input/output (i.e., data model) raises
      many challenges in system integration and often results in manual
      configuration tasks.

   o  Service fulfillment systems might have a limited visibility on the
      network state and therefore have slow response to network changes.

   Software Defined Networking (SDN) becomes crucial to address these
   challenges.  SDN techniques are meant to automate the overall service
   delivery procedures and typically rely upon standard data models.
   These models are used to not only reflect service providers' savoir-
   faire, but also to dynamically instantiate and enforce a set of

   service-inferred policies that best accommodate what has been defined
   and possibly negotiated with the customer.  [RFC7149] provides a
   first tentative attempt to rationalize that service provider's view
   on the SDN space by identifying concrete technical domains that need
   to be considered and for which solutions can be provided:

   o  Techniques for the dynamic discovery of topology, devices, and
      capabilities, along with relevant information and data models that
      are meant to precisely document such topology, devices, and their
      capabilities.

   o  Techniques for exposing network services [RFC8309] and their
      characteristics.

   o  Techniques used by service-derived dynamic resource allocation and
      policy enforcement schemes, so that networks can be programmed
      accordingly.

   o  Dynamic feedback mechanisms that are meant to assess how
      efficiently a given policy (or a set thereof) is enforced from a
      service fulfillment and assurance perspectives.

   Models are key for each of the aforementioned four technical items.
   Service and network management automation is an important step to
   improve the agility of network operations.  Models are also important
   to ease integrating multi-vendor solutions.

   YANG [RFC7950] module developers have taken both top-down and bottom-
   up approaches to develop modules [RFC8199] and to establish a mapping
   between a network technology and customer requirements at the top or
   abstracting common constructs from various network technologies at
   the bottom.  At the time of writing this document (2020), there are
   many YANG data models including configuration and Service Models that
   have been specified or are being specified by the IETF.  They cover
   many of the networking protocols and techniques.  However, how these
   models work together to configure a function, manage a set of devices
   involved in a service, or provide a service is something that is not
   currently documented either within the IETF or other Standards
   Development Organizations (SDOs).

   Many of the YANG modules listed in this document are used to exchange
   data between a NETCONF/RESTCONF clients and servers
   [RFC6241][RFC8040].  Nevertheless, YANG is transport independent data
   modeling language.  It can thus be used independently of NETCONF/
   RESTOCNF.  For example, YANG can be used to define abstract data
   structures [RFC8791] that can be manipulated by other protocols
   (e.g., [I-D.ietf-dots-rfc8782-bis]).

   This document describes an architectural framework for service and
   network management automation (Section 3) that takes advantage of
   YANG modeling technologies and investigates how different layer YANG
   data models interact with each other (e.g., service mapping, model
   composing) in the context of service delivery and fulfillment
   (Section 4).  Concretely, the following benefits can be provided:

   o  Allow for vendor-agnostic interfaces to manage a service and the
      underlying network.

   o  Move from deployment schemes where vendor-specific network
      managers are required to a scheme where the entities that are
      responsible for orchestrating and controlling services and network
      resources provided by multi-vendor devices are unified.

   o  Ease data inheritance and reusability among the various
      architecture layers promoting thus a network-wise provisioning
      instead of device-specific configuration.

   o  Dynamically fed a decision-making process (e.g., Controllers,
      Orchestrators) with notifications that will trigger appropriate
      actions allowing thus to continuously adjust a network (and thus
      involved resources) to comply the intended service to deliver.

   This framework is drawn from a network operator perspective
   irrespective of the origin of a data model; it can also accommodate
   modules that are developed outside the IETF.  The document covers
   Service Models that are used by an operator to expose its services
   and capture service requirements from the customers (including other
   operators).  Nevertheless, the document does not elaborate on the
   communication protocol(s) that makes use of these Service Models in
   order to request and deliver a service.  Such considerations are out
   of the scope.

   The document identifies a list of use cases to exemplify the proposed
   approach (Section 5), but it does not claim nor aim to be exhaustive.
   Appendix A lists some examples to illustrate the layered YANG modules
   view.

2.  Terminology and Acronyms

2.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [RFC8309][RFC8199] and are not
   redefined here:

   o  Network Operator

   o  Customer

   o  Service

   o  Data Model

   o  Service Model

   o  Network Element Module

   In addition, the document makes use of the following terms:

   Network Model:  Describes a network level abstraction (or a subset of
      aspects of a network infrastructure), including devices and their
      subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the link and
      network layers across multiple devices.  This model corresponds to
      the Network Configuration Model discussed in [RFC8309].

      It can be used by a network operator to allocate resources (e.g.,
      tunnel resource, topology resource) for the service or schedule
      resources to meet the service requirements defined in a Service
      Model.

   Network Domain:  Refers to a network partitioning that is usually
      followed by network operators to delimit parts of their network.
      "access network" and "core network" are examples of network
      domains.

   Device Model:  Refers to the Network Element YANG data model
      described in [RFC8199] or the Device Configuration Model discussed
      in [RFC8309].

      Device Models are also used to refer to model a function embedded
      in a device (e.g., Network Address Translation (NAT) [RFC8512],
      Access Control Lists (ACLs) [RFC8519]).

   Pipe:  Refers to a communication scope where only one-to-one (1:1)
      communications are allowed.  The scope can be identified between
      ingress and egress nodes, two service sites, etc.

   Hose:  Refers to a communication scope where one-to-many (1:N)
      communications are allowed (e.g., one site to multiple sites).

   Funnel:  Refers to a communication scope where many-to-one (N:1)
      communications are allowed.

3.  Architectural Concepts and Goals

3.1.  Data Models: Layering and Representation

   As described in Section 2 of [RFC8199], layering of modules allows
   for better reusability of lower-layer modules by higher-level modules
   while limiting duplication of features across layers.

   Data models in the context of network management can be classified
   into Service, Network, and Device Models.  Different Service Models
   may rely on the same set of Network and/or Device Models.

   Service Models traditionally follow a top-down approach and are
   mostly customer-facing YANG modules providing a common model
   construct for higher level network services (e.g., Layer 3 Virtual
   Private Network (L3VPN)).  Such modules can be mapped to network
   technology-specific modules at lower layers (e.g., tunnel, routing,
   Quality of Service (QoS), security).  For example, Service Models can

   be used to characterise the network service(s) to be ensured between
   service nodes (ingress/egress) such as:

   o  the communication scope (pipe, hose, funnel, ...),
   o  the directionality (inbound/outbound),
   o  the traffic performance guarantees expressed using metrics such as
      One-Way Delay (OWD) [RFC7679] or One-Way Loss [RFC7680]; a summary
      of performance metrics maintained by IANA can be found in [IPPM],
   o  link capacity [RFC5136] [I-D.ietf-ippm-capacity-metric-method],
   o  etc.

   Figure 1 depicts the example of a VoIP service that relies upon
   connectivity services offered by a network operator.  In this
   example, the VoIP service is offered to the network operator's
   customers by Service Provider (SP1).  In order to provide global VoIP
   reachability, SP1 service site interconnects with other Service
   Providers service sites typically by interconnecting Session Border
   Elements (SBEs) and Data Border Elements (DBEs) [RFC5486][RFC6406].
   For other VoIP destinations, sessions are forwarded over the
   Internet.  These connectivity services can be captured in a YANG
   Service Model that reflects the service attributes that are shown in
   Figure 2.  This example follows the IP Connectivity Provisioning
   Profile template defined in [RFC7297].

   Network Models are mainly network resource-facing modules; they
   describe various aspects of a network infrastructure, including
   devices and their subsystems, and relevant protocols operating at the
   link and network layers across multiple devices (e.g., network
   topology and traffic-engineering tunnel modules).

   Device (and function) Models usually follow a bottom-up approach and
   are mostly technology-specific modules used to realize a service
   (e.g., BGP, NAT).

   Each level maintains a view of the supported YANG modules provided by
   low-levels (see for example, Appendix A).

   Figure 3 illustrates the overall layering model.  The reader may
   refer to Section 4 of [RFC8309] for an overview of "Orchestrator" and
   "Controller" elements.  All these elements (i.e., Orchestrator(s),
   Controller(s), device(s)) are under the responsibility of the same
   operator.

      Figure 3: Layering and Representation Within a Network Operator

   A composite service offered by a network operator may rely on
   services from other operators.  In such case, the network operator
   acts as a customer to request services from other networks.  The
   operators providing these services will then follow the layering
   depicted in Figure 3.  The mapping between a composite service and a
   third-party service is maintained at the orchestration level.  From a
   data plane perspective, appropriate traffic steering policies (e.g.,
   Service Function Chaining [RFC7665]) are managed by the network
   controllers to guide how/when a third party service is invoked for
   flows bound to a composite service.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


   The layering model depicted in Figure 3 does not make any assumption
   about the location of the various entities (e.g., controller,
   orchestrator) within the network.  As such, the architecture does not
   preclude deployments where, for example, the controller is embedded
   on a device that hosts other functions that are controlled via YANG
   modules.

   In order to ease the mapping between layers and data reuse, this
   document focuses on Service Models that are modelled using YANG.
   Nevertheless, fully compliant with Section 3 of [RFC8309], Figure 3
   does not preclude Service Models to be modelled using other data
   modelling languages than YANG.

3.2.  Automation of Service Delivery Procedures

   Service Models can be used by a network operator to expose its
   services to its customers.  Exposing such models allows to automate
   the activation of service orders and thus the service delivery.  One
   or more monolithic Service Models can be used in the context of a
   composite service activation request (e.g., delivery of a caching
   infrastructure over a VPN).  Such models are used to feed a decision-
   making intelligence to adequately accommodate customer's needs.

   Also, such models may be used jointly with services that require
   dynamic invocation.  An example is provided by the service modules
   defined by the DOTS WG to dynamically trigger requests to handle
   Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks [RFC8783].  The service
   filtering request modelled using [RFC8783] will be translated into
   device-specific filtering (e.g., ACLs defined in [RFC8519]) that to
   fulfil the service request.

   Network Models can be derived from Service Models and used to
   provision, monitor, instantiate the service, and provide lifecycle
   management of network resources.  Doing so is meant to:

   o  expose network resources to customers (including other network
      operators) to provide service fulfillment and assurance.

   o  allow customers (or network operators) to dynamically adjust the
      network resources based on service requirements as described in
      Service Models (e.g., Figure 2) and the current network
      performance information described in the telemetry modules.

   Note that it is out of the scope of this document to elaborate on the
   communication protocols that are used to implement the interface
   between the service ordering (customer) and service order handling
   (provider).

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


3.3.  Service Fullfillment Automation

   To operate a service, the settings of the parameters in the Device
   Models are derived from Service Models and/or Network Models and are
   used to:

   o  Provision each involved network function/device with the proper
      configuration information.

   o  Operate the network based on service requirements as described in
      the Service Model(s) and local operational guidelines.

   In addition, the operational state including configuration that is in
   effect together with statistics should be exposed to upper layers to
   provide better network visibility and assess to what extent the
   derived low level modules are consistent with the upper level inputs.

   Filters are enforced on the notifications that are communicated to
   Service layers.  The type and frequency of notifications may be
   agreed in the Service Model.

   Note that it is important to correlate telemetry data with
   configuration data to be used for closed loops at the different
   stages of service delivery, from resource allocation to service
   operation, in particular.

3.4.  YANG Modules Integration

   To support top-down service delivery, YANG modules at different
   levels or at the same level need to be integrated together for proper
   service delivery (including, proper network setup).  For example, the
   service parameters captured in Service Models need to be decomposed
   into a set of configuration/notification parameters that may be
   specific to one or more technologies; these technology-specific
   parameters are grouped together to define technology-specific device
   level models or network level models.

   In addition, these technology-specific Device or Network Models can
   be further integrated with each other using the schema mount
   mechanism [RFC8528] to provision each involved network function/
   device or each involved network domain to support newly added module
   or features.  A collection of Device Models integrated together can
   be loaded and validated during implementation.

   High-level policies can be defined at Service or Network Models
   (e.g., "Autonomous System Number (ASN) Exclude" in the example
   depicted in Figure 2).  Device Models will be tweaked accordingly to
   provide policy-based management.  Policies can also be used for

   telemetry automation, e.g., policies that contain conditions to
   trigger the generation and pushing of new telemetry data.

4.  Functional Blocks and Interactions

            Figure 4: Service and Network Lifecycle Management

4.1.  Service Lifecycle Management Procedure

   Service lifecycle management includes end-to-end service lifecycle
   management at the service level and technology specific network
   lifecycle management at the network level.




Wu, et al.               Expires April 14, 2021                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


   The end-to-end service lifecycle management is technology-independent
   service management and spans across multiple network domains and/or
   multiple layers while technology specific service lifecycle
   management is technology domain specific or layer specific service
   lifecycle management.

4.1.1.  Service Exposure

   A service in the context of this document (sometimes called, Network
   Service) is some form of connectivity between customer sites and the
   Internet or between customer sites across the operator's network and
   across the Internet.

   Service exposure is used to capture services offered to customers
   (ordering and order handling).  One typical example is that a
   customer can use a L3VPN Service Model (L3SM) to request L3VPN
   service by providing the abstract technical characterization of the
   intended service between customer sites.

   Service Model catalogs can be created along to expose the various
   services and the information needed to invoke/order a given service.

4.1.2.  Service Creation/Modification

   A customer is usually unaware of the technology that the network
   operator has available to deliver the service, so the customer does
   not make requests specific to the underlying technology but is
   limited to making requests specific to the service that is to be
   delivered.  This service request can be filled using a Service Model.

   Upon receiving a service request, and assuming that appropriate
   authentication and authorization checks have been made with success,
   the service orchestrator/management system should verify whether the
   service requirements in the service request can be met (i.e., whether
   there is sufficient resources that can be allocated with the
   requested guarantees).

   If the request is accepted, the service orchestrator/management
   system maps such service request to its view.  This view can be
   described as a technology specific Network Model or a set of
   technology specific Device Models and this mapping may include a
   choice of which networks and technologies to use depending on which
   service features have been requested.

   In addition, a customer may require to change the underlying network
   infrastructure to adapt to new customer's needs and service
   requirements.  This service modification can be issued following the
   same Service Model used by the service request.

4.1.3.  Service Assurance

   Performance measurement telemetry (Section 4.2) can be used to
   provide service assurance at Service and/or Network levels.
   Performance measurement telemetry model can tie with Service or
   Network Models to monitor network performance or Service Level
   Agreement.

4.1.4.  Service Optimization

   Service optimization is a technique that gets the configuration of
   the network updated due to network changes, incidents mitigation, or
   new service requirements.  One typical example is once a tunnel or a
   VPN is setup, Performance monitoring information or telemetry
   information per tunnel (or per VPN) can be collected and fed into the
   management system.  If the network performance doesn't meet the
   service requirements, the management system can create new VPN
   policies capturing network service requirements and populate them
   into the network.

   Both network performance information and policies can be modelled
   using YANG.  With Policy-based management, self-configuration and
   self-optimization behavior can be specified and implemented.

   The overall service optimization is managed at the service level,
   while the network level is responsible for the optimization of the
   specific network services it provides.

4.1.5.  Service Diagnosis

   Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) are important
   networking functions for service diagnosis that allow network
   operators to:

   o  monitor network communications (i.e., reachability verification
      and Continuity Check)

   o  troubleshoot failures (i.e., fault verification and localization)

   o  monitor service-level agreements and performance (i.e.,
      performance management)

   When the network is down, service diagnosis should be in place to
   pinpoint the problem and provide recommendations (or instructions)
   for the network recovery.

   The service diagnosis information can be modelled as technology-
   independent Remote Procedure Call (RPC) operations for OAM protocols



Wu, et al.               Expires April 14, 2021                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


   and technology-independent abstraction of key OAM constructs for OAM
   protocols [RFC8531][RFC8533].  These models can be used to provide
   consistent configuration, reporting, and presentation for the OAM
   mechanisms used to manage the network.

4.1.6.  Service Decommission

   Service decommission allows a customer to stop the service by
   removing the service from active status and thus releasing the
   network resources that were allocated to the service.  Customers can
   also use the Service Model to withdraw the registration to a service.

4.2.  Service Fullfillment Management Procedure

4.2.1.  Intended Configuration Provision

   Intended configuration at the device level is derived from Network
   Models at the network level or Service Model at the service level and
   represents the configuration that the system attempts to apply.  Take
   L3SM as a Service Model example to deliver a L3VPN service, there is
   a need to map the L3VPN service view defined in the Service Model
   into a detailed intended configuration view defined by specific
   configuration models for network elements; the configuration
   information includes:

   o  Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) definition, including VPN
      policy expression

   o  Physical Interface(s)

   o  IP layer (IPv4, IPv6)

   o  QoS features such as classification, profiles, etc.

   o  Routing protocols: support of configuration of all protocols
      listed in a service request, as well as routing policies
      associated with those protocols.

   o  Multicast support

   o  Address sharing (e.g., NAT)

   o  Security

   These specific configuration models can be used to configure Provider
   Edge (PE) and Customer Edge (CE) devices within a site, e.g., a BGP
   policy model can be used to establish VPN membership between sites
   and VPN Service Topology.



Wu, et al.               Expires April 14, 2021                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


   Note that in networks with legacy devices (that support proprietary
   modules or do not support YANG at all), an adaptation layer is likely
   to be required at the network level so that these devices can be
   involved in the delivery of the network services.

4.2.2.  Configuration Validation

   Configuration validation is used to validate intended configuration
   and ensure the configuration take effect.

   For example, a customer creates an interface "eth-0/0/0" but the
   interface does not physically exist at this point, then configuration
   data appears in the <intended> status but does not appear in
   <operational> datastore.

4.2.3.  Performance Monitoring/Model-driven Telemetry

   When a configuration is in effect in a device, <operational>
   datastore holds the complete operational state of the device
   including learned, system, default configuration, and system state.
   However, the configurations and state of a particular device does not
   have the visibility on the whole network or how packets are going to
   be forwarded through the entire network.  Therefore, it becomes more
   difficult to operate the entire network without understanding the
   current status of the network.

   The management system should subscribe to updates of a YANG datastore
   in all the network devices for performance monitoring purposes and
   build a full topological visibility of the network by aggregating
   (and filtering) these operational state from different sources.

4.2.4.  Fault Diagnostic

   When configuration is in effect in a device, some devices may be mis-
   configured (e.g., device links are not consistent in both sides of
   the network connection) or network resources be mis-allocated.
   Therefore, services may be negatively affected without knowing the
   root cause in the network.

   Technology-dependent nodes and RPC commands are defined in
   technology-specific YANG data models which can use and extend the
   base model described in Section 4.1.5 to deal with these issues.

   These RPC commands received in the technology-dependent node can be
   used to trigger technology-specific OAM message exchanges for fault
   verification and fault isolation.  For example, TRILL Multicast Tree
   Verification (MTV) RPC command [I-D.ietf-trill-yang-oam] can be used

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


   to trigger Multi-Destination Tree Verification Message defined in
   [RFC7455] to verify TRILL distribution tree integrity.

4.3.  Multi-Layer/Multi-Domain Service Mapping

   Multi-layer/Multi-domain Service Mapping allows to map an end-to-end
   abstract view of the service segmented at different layers and/or
   different network domains into domain-specific views.

   One example is to map service parameters in the L3SM into
   configuration parameters such as Route Distinguisher (RD), Route
   Target (RT), and VRF in the L3VPN Network Model (L3NM).

   Another example is to map service parameters in the L3SM into Traffic
   Engineered (TE) tunnel parameter (e.g., Tunnel ID) in TE model and
   Virtual Network (VN) parameters (e.g., Access Point (AP) list, VN
   members) in the YANG data model for VN operation
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang].

4.4.  Service Decomposing

   Service Decomposing allows to decompose Service Models at the service
   level or Network Models at the network level into a set of Device
   Models at the device level.  These Device Models may be tied to
   specific device types or classified into a collection of related YANG
   modules based on service types and features offered, and load at the
   implementation time before configuration is loaded and validated.

5.  YANG Data Model Integration Examples

   The following subsections provide some YANG data models integration
   examples.

5.1.  L2VPN/L3VPN Service Delivery

   In reference to Figure 5, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the L3VPN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in Section 4:

   1.  The Customer requests to create two sites (as per Service
       Creation in Section 4.2.1) relying upon L3SM with each site
       having one network access connectivity, for example:

       *  Site A: network-access A, link-capacity = 20 Mbps, class
          "foo", guaranteed-capacity-percent = 10, average-one-way-delay
          = 70 ms.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


       *  Site B: network-access B, link-capacity = 30 Mbps, class
          "foo1", guaranteed-capacity-percent = 15, average-one-way-
          delay = 60 ms.

   2.  The Orchestrator extracts the service parameters from the L3SM.
       Then, it uses them as input to the Service Mapping in Section 4.3
       to translate them into an orchestrated configuration parameters
       (e.g., RD, RT, VRF) that are part of the L3NM specified in
       [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm].

   3.  The Controller takes the orchestrated configuration parameters in
       the L3NM and translates them into orchestrated (Service
       Decomposing in Section 4.4) configuration of network elements
       that are part of, e.g., BGP, QoS, Network Instance, IP
       management, and interface models.

   [I-D.ogondio-opsawg-uni-topology] can be used for representing,
   managing, and controlling the User Network Interface (UNI) topology.

   L3NM inherits some of data elements from the L3SM.  Nevertheless, the
   L3NM does not expose some information to the above layer such as the
   capabilities of an underlying network (which can be used to drive
   service order handling) or notifications (to notify subscribers about
   specific events or degradations as per agreed SLAs).  Some of this
   information can be provided using, e.g.,
   [I-D.www-bess-yang-vpn-service-pm].  A target overall model is
   depicted in Figure 6.

             Figure 6: L3VPN Service Delivery Example (Target)

   Note that a similar analysis can be performed for Layer 2 VPNs
   (L2VPNs).  A L2VPN Service Model (L2SM) is defined in [RFC8466],
   while the L2VPN Network YANG Model (L2NM) is specified in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm].

5.2.  VN Lifecycle Management

   In reference to Figure 7, the following steps are performed to
   deliver the VN service within the network management automation
   architecture defined in Section 4:

   1.  A customer makes a request (Service Exposure in Section 4.1.1) to
       create a VN.  The association between the VN, APs, and VN members
       is defined in the VN YANG module [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang].

   2.  The Orchestrator creates the single abstract node topology based
       on the information captured in the request.

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


   3.  The customer exchanges with the Orchestrator the connectivity
       matrix on the abstract node and explicit paths using the TE
       topology model [RFC8795].  This information can be used to
       instantiate the VN and setup tunnels between source and
       destination endpoints (Service Creation in Section 4.1.2).

   4.  The telemetry model which augments the VN model and corresponding
       TE tunnel model can be used to subscribe to performance
       measurement data and notify all the parameter changes and network
       performance changes related to VN topology or Tunnel
       [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-pm-telemetry-autonomics] and provide service
       assurance (Service Optimization in Section 4.1.4).

5.3.  Event-based Telemetry in the Device Self Management

   In reference to Figure 8, the following steps are performed to
   monitor state changes of managed resources in a network device and
   provide device self-management within the network management
   automation architecture defined in Section 4:

   1.  To control which state a network device should be in or is
       allowed to be in at any given time, a set of conditions and
       actions are defined and correlated with network events (e.g.,
       allow the NETCONF server to send updates only when the value



Wu, et al.               Expires April 14, 2021                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


       exceeds a certain threshold for the first time, but not again
       until the threshold is cleared), which constitute an
       Event/Condition/Action (ECA) policy or an event-driven policy
       control logic that can be executed on the device (e.g.,
       [I-D.wwx-netmod-event-yang]).

   2.  To provide rapid autonomic response that can exhibit self-
       management properties, the Controller pushes the ECA policy to
       the network device and delegates the network control logic to the
       network device.

   3.  The network device uses the ECA model to subscribe to the event
       source, e.g., an event stream or datastore state data conveyed to
       the server via YANG Push subscription [RFC8641], monitors state
       parameters, and takes simple and instant actions when associated
       event condition on state parameters is met.  ECA notifications
       can be generated as the result of actions based on event stream
       subscription or datastore subscription (model-driven telemetry
       operation discussed in Section 4.2.3).

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules cited in this document define schema for data that
   are designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer




Wu, et al.               Expires April 14, 2021                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   Security considerations specific to each of the technologies and
   protocols listed in the document are discussed in the specification
   documents of each of these protocols.

   In order to prevent leaking sensitive information, special care
   should be considered when translating between the various layers in
   Section 4 or when aggregating data retrieved from various sources.
   The network operator must enforce means to protect privacy-related
   information included in customer-facing models.

   To detect misalignment between layers that might be induced by
   misbehaving nodes, upper layers should continuously monitor the
   perceived service (Section 4.1.4) and should proceed with checks to
   assess that the provided service complies with the expected service
   and that the data reported by an underlying layer is matching the
   perceived service by the above layer.  Typically, such checks are the
   responsibility of the service diagnosis (Section 4.1.5).

   Additional considerations are discussed in the following subsections.

6.1.  Service Level

   A provider may rely on services offered by other providers to build
   composite services.  Appropriate mechanisms should be enabled by the
   provider to monitor and detect a service disruption from these
   providers.  The characterization of a service disruption (including,
   mean time between failures, mean time to repair), the escalation
   procedure, and penalties are usually documented in contractual
   agreements (e.g., Section 2.1 of [RFC4176]).  Misbehaving peer
   providers will thus be identified and appropriate countermeasures
   will be applied.

6.2.  Network Level

   Security considerations specific to the network level are listed
   below:

   o  A controller may create forwarding loops by mis-configuring the
      underlying network nodes.  It is recommended to proceed with tests
      to check the status of forwarding paths regularly or whenever



Wu, et al.               Expires April 14, 2021                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft  Service and Network Management Automation   October 2020


      changes are made to routing or forwarding processes.  Such checks
      may be triggered from the service level owing to the means
      discussed in Section 4.1.5.

   o  Some Service Models may include a traffic isolation clause,
      appropriate technology-specific actions must be enforced at the
      underlying network (and thus involved network devices) to avoid
      that such traffic is accessible to non-authorized parties.

6.3.  Device Level

   Network operators should monitor and audit their networks to detect
   misbehaving nodes and abnormal behaviors.  For example, OAM discussed
   in Section 4.1.5 can be used for that purpose.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA requests or assignments included in this document.

Appendix A.  Layered YANG Modules Examples Overview

   This appendix lists a set of YANG data models that can be used for
   the delivery of connectivity services.  These models can be
   classified as Service, Network, or Device Models.

   It is not the intent of this appendix to provide an inventory of
   tools and mechanisms used in specific network and service management
   domains; such inventory can be found in documents such as [RFC7276].

   The reader may refer to the YANG Catalog
   (<https://www.yangcatalog.org>) or the public Github YANG repository
   (<https://github.com/YangModels/yang>) to query existing YANG models.

   The YANG Catalog includes some metadata to indicate the module type
   ('module-classification') [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog].  Note
   that the mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-netmod-module-tags] allows to
   associate tags with YANG modules in order to help classifying the
   modules.

A.1.  Service Models: Definition and Samples

   As described in [RFC8309], the service is "some form of connectivity
   between customer sites and the Internet and/or between customer sites
   across the network operator's network and across the Internet".  More
   concretely, an IP connectivity service can be defined as the IP
   transfer capability characterized by a (Source Nets, Destination
   Nets, Guarantees, Scope) tuple where "Source Nets" is a group of
   unicast IP addresses, "Destination Nets" is a group of IP unicast
   and/or multicast addresses, and "Guarantees" reflects the guarantees
   (expressed in terms of QoS, performance, and availability, for
   example) to properly forward traffic to the said "Destination"
   [RFC7297].

   For example:

   o  The L3SM [RFC8299] defines the L3VPN service ordered by a customer
      from a network operator.

   o  The L2SM [RFC8466] defines the L2VPN service ordered by a customer
      from a network operator.

   o  The Virtual Network (VN) model [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-vn-yang]
      provides a YANG data model applicable to any mode of VN operation.

   L2SM and L3SM are customer Service Models as per [RFC8309].

A.2.  Schema Mount

   Modularity and extensibility were among the leading design principles
   of the YANG data modeling language.  As a result, the same YANG
   module can be combined with various sets of other modules and thus
   form a data model that is tailored to meet the requirements of a
   specific use case.  [RFC8528] defines a mechanism, denoted schema
   mount, that allows for mounting one data model consisting of any
   number of YANG modules at a specified location of another (parent)
   schema.

A.3.  Network Models: Samples

   L2NM [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l2nm] and L3NM [I-D.ietf-opsawg-l3sm-l3nm] are
   examples of YANG Network Models.

              Figure 9: Sample Resource Facing Network Models

   Examples of topology YANG modules are listed below:

   o  Network Topologies Model: [RFC8345] defines a base model for
      network topology and inventories.  Network topology data include
      link resource, node resource, and terminate-point resources.

   o  TE Topology Model: [RFC8795] defines a YANG data model for
      representing and manipulating TE topologies.

      This module is extended from network topology model defined in
      [RFC8345] with TE topologies related content.  This model contains
      technology-agnostic TE Topology building blocks that can be

      augmented and used by other technology-specific TE topology
      models.

   o  Layer 3 Topology Model:

      [RFC8346] defines a YANG data model for representing and
      manipulating Layer 3 topologies.  This model is extended from the
      network topology model defined in [RFC8345] with Layer 3
      topologies specifics.

   o  Layer 2 Topology Model:

      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-l2-network-topology] defines a YANG data model
      for representing and manipulating Layer 2 topologies.  This model
      is extended from the network topology model defined in [RFC8345]
      with Layer 2 topology specifics.

   Examples of tunnel YANG modules are provided below:

   o  Tunnel identities: [RFC8675] defines a collection of YANG
      identities used as interface types for tunnel interfaces.

   o  TE Tunnel Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] defines a YANG module for the
      configuration and management of TE interfaces, tunnels, and LSPs.

   o  Segment Routing (SR) Traffic Engineering (TE) Tunnel Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for SR-TE specific data.

   o  MPLS-TE Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] augments the TE generic and MPLS-TE
      model(s) and defines a YANG module for MPLS-TE configurations,
      state, RPC and notifications.

   o  RSVP-TE MPLS Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-rsvp-te] augments the RSVP-TE generic module
      with parameters to configure and manage signaling of MPLS RSVP-TE
      LSPs.

   Other sample Network Models are listed hereafter:

   o  Path Computation API Model:

      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-path-computation] YANG module for a stateless
      RPC which complements the stateful solution defined in
      [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].

   o  OAM Models (including Fault Management (FM) and Performance
      Monitoring):

      [RFC8532] defines a base YANG module for the management of OAM
      protocols that use Connectionless Communications.  [RFC8533]
      defines a retrieval method YANG module for connectionless OAM
      protocols.  [RFC8531] defines a base YANG module for connection
      oriented OAM protocols.  These three models are intended to
      provide consistent reporting, configuration, and representation
      for connection-less OAM and Connection oriented OAM separately.

      Alarm monitoring is a fundamental part of monitoring the network.
      Raw alarms from devices do not always tell the status of the
      network services or necessarily point to the root cause.
      [RFC8632] defines a YANG module for alarm management.

A.4.  Device Models: Samples

   Network Element models (Figure 10) are used to describe how a service
   can be implemented by activating and tweaking a set of functions
   (enabled in one or multiple devices, or hosted in cloud
   infrastructures) that are involved in the service delivery.
   Figure 10 uses IETF-defined data models as an example.

A.4.1.  Model Composition

   o  Logical Network Element Model

      [RFC8530] defines a logical network element module which can be
      used to manage the logical resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for logical resource partitioning are Logical Systems or Logical
      Routers.

   o  Network Instance Model

      [RFC8529] defines a network instance module.  This module can be
      used to manage the virtual resource partitioning that may be
      present on a network device.  Examples of common industry terms
      for virtual resource partitioning are VRF instances and Virtual
      Switch Instances (VSIs).

A.4.2.  Device Management

   The following list enumerates some YANG modules that can be used for
   device management:

   o  [RFC8348]: defines a YANG module for the management of hardware.

   o  [RFC7317]: defines the "ietf-system" YANG module that provides
      many features such as the configuration and the monitoring of
      system or system control operations (e.g., shutdown, restart,
      setting time) identification.

   o  [RFC8341]: defines a network configuration access control YANG
      module.

A.4.3.  Interface Management

   The following provides some YANG modules that can be used for
   interface management:

   o  [RFC7224]: defines a YANG module for interface type definitions.

   o  [RFC8343]: defines a YANG module for the management of network
      interfaces.

A.4.4.  Some Device Model Examples

   The following provides an overview of some Device Models that can be
   used within a network.  This list is not comprehensive.

   L2VPN:     [I-D.ietf-bess-l2vpn-yang] defines a YANG module for MPLS
              based Layer 2 VPN services (L2VPN) [RFC4664] and includes
              switching between the local attachment circuits.  The
              L2VPN model covers point-to-point VPWS and Multipoint VPLS
              services.  These services use signaling of Pseudowires
              across MPLS networks using LDP [RFC8077][RFC4762] or BGP
              [RFC4761].

   EVPN:      [I-D.ietf-bess-evpn-yang] defines a YANG module for
              Ethernet VPN services.  The model is agnostic of the
              underlay.  It applies to MPLS as well as to VxLAN
              encapsulation.  The module is also agnostic to the
              services, including E-LAN, E-LINE, and E-TREE services.

              which serves as a base framework for configuring and
              managing an MPLS switching subsystem.  It is expected that
              other MPLS technology YANG modules (e.g., MPLS LSP Static,
              LDP, or RSVP-TE models) will augment the MPLS base YANG
              module.

   BGP:       [I-D.ietf-idr-bgp-model] defines a YANG module for
              configuring and managing BGP, including protocol, policy,
              and operational aspects based on data center, carrier, and
              content provider operational requirements.

   Routing Policy:  [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-policy-model] defines a YANG module
              for configuring and managing routing policies based on
              operational practice.  The module provides a generic
              policy framework which can be augmented with protocol-
              specific policy configuration.

   SR/SRv6:   [I-D.ietf-spring-sr-yang] a YANG module for segment
              routing configuration and operation.

              network protocol which is used for liveness detection of
              arbitrary paths between systems.  [I-D.ietf-bfd-yang]
              defines a YANG module that can be used to configure and
              manage BFD.

   Multicast: [I-D.ietf-pim-yang] defines a YANG module that can be used
              to configure and manage Protocol Independent Multicast
              (PIM) devices.

              [RFC8652] defines a YANG module that can be used to
              configure and manage Internet Group Management Protocol
              (IGMP) and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) devices.

              module that can be used to configure and manage Internet
              Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and Multicast Listener
              Discovery (MLD) Snooping devices.

              [I-D.ietf-bess-mvpn-yang] defines a YANG data model to
              configure and manage Multicast in MPLS/BGP IP VPNs
              (MVPNs).

   PM:        [I-D.ietf-ippm-twamp-yang] defines a YANG data model for
              client and server implementations of the Two-Way Active
              Measurement Protocol (TWAMP).

              [I-D.ietf-ippm-stamp-yang] defines the data model for
              implementations of Session-Sender and Session-Reflector
              for Simple Two-way Active Measurement Protocol (STAMP)
              mode using YANG.
