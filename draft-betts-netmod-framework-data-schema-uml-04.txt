Abstract

   This draft describes a framework for how purpose and protocol
   specific interfaces can be systematically derived from an underlying
   common information model, focusing upon the networking and forwarding
   domain.  The benefit of using such an approach in interface
   specification development is to promote convergence,
   interoperability, and efficiency.

Internet-Draft         Data Schema from UML Model           October 2016


1.  Introduction

   Interface specifications are often generated as point solutions where
   the designer codes a particular interface from domain (problem space)
   concepts that may not be explicitly captured, may be defined using
   localized terminology that is subject to ambiguity in interpretation,
   and is highly focused on a particular use-case/application.  The
   designer typically provides a representation of the interface schema
   in the form of a data schema [RFC3444](i.e., data structures conveyed
   over the interface), which only exposes the view of the domain
   relevant at that specific interface.  As this data schema is a simple
   statement of the particular interface, it solely describes
   relationships relevant to the specific realization, having no
   inherent relationship to other interfaces in the system.

   Approaching the development of interface specifications on a per use-
   case/application basis tends to promote unnecessary variety through a
   proliferation of similar interfaces, resulting in unnecessary
   divergences that limit interoperability.  It also risks confusion of
   representational artifacts with fundamental characteristics of the
   information to be conveyed across the interface.  There is also a
   risk that conflicting representations of the same information may be
   generated.  Finally, as each such interface appears to stand alone,
   it thereby fails to capture relationships with other aspects of the
   same (or different) domains that are not explicitly needed for the
   interface.

   This draft describes a framework for how a protocol specific data
   schema and the encoding used for the interface can be systematically
   derived from an underlying common information model, focusing upon
   the networking and forwarding domain.  The benefit of using such an
   approach in the development of interface specifications is to promote
   convergence, interoperability, and efficiency.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Basic Concepts

   An information model condenses domain knowledge and insights to
   provide a representation of its essential concepts, structures, and
   inter-relationships.  In capturing domain understanding, such a model
   offers a coherent and consistent terminology and structure, expresses
   the semantics of the domain, and interrelates all relevant aspects of
   the domain.  It enables a consistent expression of information that

   improves interoperability between software components at interfaces
   derived from it.  A "good" information model should capture domain
   best practices, and be designed to support domain variety as well as
   extensibility and evolution.  Examples of domains include networking
   and forwarding, storage, etc.  A common industry information model is
   the assembly of all domain information models, which inter-relate at
   "touch points".  Note that a common industry information model should
   not be interpreted as being a monolithic entity; in particular, a
   modular structure is essential to allow for extensibility.

   There may be several relevant views of any particular domain,
   depending upon the perspective of the viewer, all of which are
   interrelated and involve subsets of the information model, and none
   of which contradict each other.  (It should be noted that one view
   provides the information model representation of the overall domain.)
   To form a particular (purpose-specific) view, some elements of the
   model may be pruned.  Additionally, for efficiency, some systematic
   refactoring of the information model may also occur.

   In this draft, the term data schema is used in the context of either:
   (i) a specific protocol that is used to implement a purpose specific
   interface, or (ii) a programming language that is used to invoke a
   purpose specific API.  Note that it is possible to map directly from
   the purpose specific information model to interface encoding.

   While a purpose specific interface/API is not a simple direct
   encoding of the information model of the overall domain, it is by its
   nature based on a relevant view of the information model of the
   domain (i.e., a purpose specific information model view).  It must be
   completely and consistently traceable to this view and should use the
   associated domain terminology.  Depending on its application, a
   particular view may lead to a number of encoded forms at various
   types of interfaces/APIs.  The information model does not dictate the
   encoded form, which will depend upon such factors as necessary
   capability, interaction style, and programming language.

3.  Information Modeling

   This section introduces the Unified Modeling Language (UML), which
   has been used to model application structure, behavior, and
   architecture (in addition to business process and data structure).
   It also provides references to existing and ongoing work on standard
   information models based on UML.

3.1.  Unified Modeling Language

   The information model is expressed in terms of the Unified Modeling
   Language (UML) [OMG_UML], which was developed by the Object
   Management Group.  It is a general-purpose modeling language in the
   field of software engineering.  In 2000 the Unified Modeling Language
   was also accepted by the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard [ISO_IEC_UML].  UML
   may be used in four ways:

   o  To define a set of objects (instantiated classes that, if
      organized, describe a data model)

   o  As an information model

   o  As a metamodel (used to create an information model)

   o  As a meta-metamodel

   UML defines a number of basic model elements (UML artifacts), such as
   object classes, attributes, associations, interfaces, operations,
   operation parameters, data types, etc.  In order to assure a
   consistent and harmonized modelling approach, and to ensure
   uniformity in the application of UML to a problem domain, a subset of
   the basic model artifacts should be selected according to guidelines
   for creating an information model expressed in UML [ONF_TR-514].  The
   guidelines are generic; i.e., they are not specific to any particular
   domain that the information model is addressing, nor are they
   restricted to any particular protocol interface data schema.  A UML
   information model may be created using Open Source UML tools;
   guidelines to be taken into account during the creation of a UML
   information model for the Open Source tool Papyrus have been
   developed in [ONF_TR-515].

3.2.  Standard UML Information Model

   Information models expressed in UML, primarily focused upon the
   networking and forwarding domain, have been, and are in the process
   of being, developed in ITU-T, TM Forum, NGMN, 3GPP, MEF, ONF, and
   others.

   ONF has defined the Core Model of the ONF Common Information Model
   (ONF-CIM).  The ONF Core Model [ONF_TR-512] provides a representation
   of network resources for the purpose of management-control and is
   independent of specific forwarding technology.  The Core Model can be
   augmented to provide forwarding technology specific representation.

Internet-Draft         Data Schema from UML Model           October 2016


   ITU-T Recommendations are focused on understanding the
   telecommunications problem space and developing information models
   addressing network and network element considerations.  Some examples
   of available standard ITU-T information models relevant to the
   networking and forwarding domain include:

   o  ITU-T G.874.1 (2016), Optical transport network: Protocol-neutral
      management information model for the network element view
      [ITU-T_G.874.1]

   o  ITU-T G.8052/Y.1346 (2016), Protocol-neutral management
      information model for the Ethernet Transport capable network
      element [ITU-T_G.8052]

   o  ITU-T G.8152/Y.1375 (2016), Protocol-neutral management
      information model for the MPLS-TP network element [ITU-T_G.8152]

   o  ITU-T G.7711/Y.1702 (2016), Generic protocol-neutral management
      Information Model for transport resources [ITU-T_G.7711]

      Note that ONF and ITU-T have adopted the same Core Model in
      [ONF_TR-512] and [ITU-T_G.7711], and are continuing to maintain
      alignment.

   The above information models are developed from ITU-T Recommendations
   that define the respective transport technology functional models and
   management requirements.

   The TM Forum community has likewise developed extensive models of the
   same space from the network level management perspective [TMF_MTNM]
   [TMF_MTOSI] [TMF_TR225].  The basis for all functions made available
   to the network level management is defined in the protocol-neutral
   network element level management work done in ITU-T.  Its models thus
   complement the ITU-T information models.  In further collaboration
   with 3GPP, considerable joint effort has been devoted to develop a
   consistent and coherent approach to that space.  Most recently
   (September 2016), a Collaboration Agreement was signed between the
   MEF Forum, ONF, and TM Forum to enable common model collaboration on
   Information Model constructs and network resource Information Model.

   The NGMN has published a document called Next Generation Converged
   Operations Requirements (NGCOR) [NGMN_NGCOR], with the expressed
   purpose of taking these requirements into account when converged
   management interfaces for mobile and fixed networks are being
   standardized in the SDOs.  An ongoing collaboration called the Multi-
   SDO Project on Converged Management is taking care that the
   requirements are considered during the specification of new

   interfaces.  It includes participants from ETSI, NGMN, TMF, 3GPP, and
   other SDOs, equipment vendors, OS vendors and service providers.

4.  From UML IM to Data Schema Definition

   This section outlines the overall structure of a modular and
   evolvable common information model and how purpose specific IM views
   and data schema may be derived from it [ONF_TR-513].

4.1.  Methodology Overview

   As illustrated in Figure 1 below, the common information model is
   comprised of a library of model artifacts (objects, attributes, and
   associations) organized into a number of sub-models, to facilitate
   the independent development of technology and application specific
   extensions.  The Core Model refers to information model artifacts
   that are intended for use by multiple applications and/or forwarding
   technologies.  For purposes of navigability, the Core Model is
   further sub-structured into Core Network Model (CNM), Core Foundation
   Model, Core Physical Model, and the Core Specification Model (these
   are further discussed in Section 4.2.1).  The forwarding technology
   specific model refers to technology specific extensions; e.g., for
   OTN, Ethernet, MPLS-TP, SDH, etc.  The application specific model
   refers to extensions for supporting particular applications.

     High-level common information model structure and methodology for
   deriving interface protocol specific data schema/interface encodings

                                 Figure 1

   The following subsections provide further elaboration of the high-
   level methodology introduced above.

4.2.  Common Information Model

   As introduced earlier, a common information model includes the
   objects/packages, their properties (represented as attributes), and
   their relationships, etc. that are necessary to describe the domain
   for the applications being developed.  It will be necessary to
   continually expand and refine the common model over time as new
   forwarding technologies, capabilities and applications are
   encompassed and new insights are gained.  To allow these extensions
   to be made in a seamless manner, the common information model is
   structured into a number of sub-models.  This modelling approach
   enables application specific and forwarding technology specific
   extensions to be developed by domain experts with appropriate
   independence.

Internet-Draft         Data Schema from UML Model           October 2016


   Over time, some part(s) of the common information model may need to
   be augmented or changed.  Any such areas are clearly identified using
   model lifecycle stereotypes (controlled annotations; e.g.,
   experimental, preliminary, obsolete) to ensure ongoing compatibility
   and to ease migration.  The use of the lifecycle stereotypes is
   described in the UML modeling guidelines [ONF_TR-514].

4.2.1.  Core Model

   The core model is organized into a number of sub-models, each
   addressing a specific topic to allow for easier navigation.
   Currently, these consist of the Core Network Model (CNM), Core
   Foundation Model, Core Physical Model, and the Core Specification
   Model [I-D.lam-topology].

   o  The CNM consists of artifacts that model the essential network
      aspects that are neutral to the forwarding technology(ies) of the
      network.  The CNM currently encompasses Forwarding, Termination,
      Topology, and Resilience aspects (subsets of the CNM).

   o  The Core Foundation Model provides a detailed view of all aspects
      of the CNM that are relevant to all other parts of the Common
      Information Model.  Currently, this model includes coverage of
      naming and identifiers (so that communications about an entity can
      take place).

   o  The Core Physical Model provides a view of the model for physical
      entities (including equipment, holders, and connectors).

   o  The Core Specification Model provides for a machine readable form
      of specific localized behavior, enables the introduction of run
      time schema, allows leverage of existing standards definitions
      (e.g., technology/application specific) in a machine readable
      language, and simplifies representations.

4.2.2.  Technology specific or application specific Sub-models

   These sub-models contain the artifacts (objects, attributes and
   associations) that relate solely the specific technology or
   application.  In some cases, the addition of an application or
   technology sub-model will also require, and result in, enhancement of
   the core model.

4.3.  Common Information Model View for a Specific Purpose

   The next step is the development of a purpose specific information
   model, which is a true subset of the common information model.  A
   purpose specific information model will typically be much smaller



Betts, et al.            Expires April 28, 2017                 [Page 9]

   than the entire common information model.  To provide maximal reuse,
   the purpose specific view is developed in two steps: (1) prune and
   refactor a copy of the artifacts of the common information model to
   provide a model of the network to provide a purpose specific
   information model of the network to be managed, where only those
   artefacts that represent the capabilities that are both in scope and
   supported are included, and (2) define the access rights for the
   various groups of users that will manage that network.  Pruning and
   refactoring provides a purpose specific information model that
   represents the capabilities of the network of interest.  The
   definition of access rights provides the ability to limit the actions
   that can be taken by the various user groups that will use that
   information model.

   o  Pruning is used to derive a (smaller) model with a narrower scope
      or view.  Pruning can remove the objects/packages/attributes/
      associations that are not required.

      - Select the required object classes from the common IM (all
        mandatory attributes and packages must be included)

      - Select the required conditional packages and optional attributes
        (note that, where appropriate, conditional packages and optional
        attributes may be declared mandatory in the purpose specific IM)

      - Remove any optional associations that are not required

   o  Refactoring allows the model to be simplified and made compatible
      with existing models or terminology.  Some guidelines for
      refactoring include:

      - Collapsing of classes when reducing multiplicity (e.g., from
        [1..*] to [1]).  When this results in a composition association
        of multiplicity [1] between a subordinate and superior object
        class, they can be combined into a single object class by moving
        the attributes of the superior class into the subordinate class.

      - Splitting of a class along a view boundary where the two parts
        are related by a specific multiplicity.

      - Where beneficial, reducing the depth of the inheritance (i.e.,
        combining object classes by moving the attributes of the super
        class into the subclass).

      - Adding reverse navigation, if useful for the purpose.  In many
        places in the common IM, there is only support for navigation
        from a subordinate object class to a superior object class.
        This allows new subordinate object classes to be added without

        any impact on the superior object class.  In a purpose specific
        implementation it is frequently useful to be able to navigate
        the relationship between superior and subordinate object classes
        in both directions.

      - Constraining attribute definitions.  This can be done by
        reducing legal value ranges, defining which (if any) attributes
        should be read only (for all users), and/or defining constraints
        between attributes.

   o  Traceability

        Use the Realization association with a specific stereotype
        PruneAndRefactor to maintain the traceability from the pruned/
        refactored model to the Common IM.

4.4.  Data Schema

   A data schema (DS) is developed in the context of either a specific
   protocol that is used to implement a purpose specific interface or a
   programming language that is used to invoke a purpose specific API.
   The DS is constructed by mapping of the purpose specific information
   model together with the operations patterns from the common
   information model to provide the interface protocol specific DS that
   includes operations and notifications.  The operations should include
   data structures taken directly from the purpose specific information
   model view with no further adjustment.

   The development of the data schema should consider the following:

   o  The operations should act on the information in a way consistent
      with the modeled object lifecycle interdependency rules as defined
      in the common IM.

      - Instance lifecycle dependencies should ensure sensible interface
        operation structuring and interface flow rules

      - Some form of transaction should be used over the interface to
        account for lifecycle dependencies of the model

   o  The operations should abide by the attribute properties.  Read
      only attributes (except those which are defined as isInvariant)
      should not be included in data related to creation of an object
      (e.g., not in createData) or in a specification of a desired
      object structure outcome.

   o  Usage of attribute value ranges, etc. to allow "effort" statement,
      optionality and negotiation to be supported by the interface.

4.5.  Interface encoding

   This step encodes either a purpose specific data schema or a purpose
   specific information model into either: (i) a specific protocol that
   is used to implement a purpose specific interface, or (ii) a
   programming language that is used to invoke a purpose specific API.
   If the interface is encoded directly from the purpose specific
   information model then the interface operations must be added as
   described above.

5.  Translation from UML

   Applying the methodology outlined in Section 4, protocol-specific
   interface data schema/encodings may be derived from existing, and
   emerging, standard UML information models addressing the forwarding
   and networking domains (e.g., [ITU-T_G.7711], G.874.1
   [ITU-T_G.874.1]).

   In order to assure a consistent and valid data modelling language
   representation that enables maximum interoperability, translation
   guidelines from UML information models to data schema/interface
   encodings are required.  A set of translation rules also assists in
   development of automated tooling.

   Guidelines have been developed for translation of data modeled with
   UML to YANG including mapping of object classes, attributes, data
   types, associations, interfaces, operations and operation parameters,
   notifications, and lifecycle [ONF_TR-531], [I-D.mansfield-uml].

   It should be noted that the concept of deriving protocol-specific
   modules from UML information models is not new (e.g., MEF 38 [MEF_38]
   and MEF 39 [MEF_39] provide YANG modules derived from UML information
   models G.8052 [ITU-T_G.8052] and MEF 7.1 [MEF_7.1] for Service OAM
   Fault and Performance Monitoring, respectively.).  What is new is the
   concept of an open, modular, evolvable common information model,
   coupled with an associated suite of essential guidelines and tooling
   (e.g., UML, Open Source tooling, translation, etc.), for realizing a
   coherent set of solution modules.

6.  Summary

   This draft describes a modular and scalable approach for
   systematically deriving purpose and protocol specific interfaces from
   an underlying common information model, focusing upon the networking
   and forwarding domain.  Building upon an underlying common
   information modeling description of network resources (functionality,
   capabilities, flexibility) is a key enabler to convergence and
   interoperability.  It is also future proof in the sense that the

   emergence of new protocols becomes solely a non-disruptive mapping
   issue.  It should be noted that not all domains require development
   of information model prior to solutions development; the domains
   where this is of greatest benefit involve networking domains
   requiring support for an enhanced level of control and network
   programmability.
