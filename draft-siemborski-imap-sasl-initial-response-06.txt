Abstract

    To date, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) has used a
    Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) profile which always
    required at least one complete round trip for an authentication, as
    it did not support an initial client response argument.  This
    additional round trip at the beginning of the session is
    undesirable, especially when round trip costs are high.

    This document defines an extension to IMAP which allows clients and
    servers to avoid this round trip by allowing an initial client
    response argument to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE command.

IMAP Extension for SASL Initial Client Response            November 2006


1.  Conventions Used in This Document

    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

    In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and
    server respectively.

    Formal syntax is defined by [RFC4234] as extended by [RFC3501].


2.  Introduction

    The SASL initial client response extension is present in any IMAP
    [RFC3501] server implementation which returns "SASL-IR" as one of
    the supported capabilities in its CAPABILITY response.

    Servers which support this extension will accept an optional initial
    client response with the AUTHENTICATE command for any SASL [RFC4422]
    mechanisms which support it.


3.  IMAP Changes to the IMAP AUTHENTICATE Command

    This extension adds an optional second argument to the AUTHENTICATE
    command that is defined in Section 6.2.2 of [RFC3501].  If this
    second argument is present, it represents the contents of the
    "initial client response" defined in section 5.1 of [RFC4422].

    As with any other client response, this initial client response MUST
    be encoded as defined in Section 4 of [RFC4648].  It also MUST be
    transmitted outside of a quoted string or literal.  To send a zero-
    length initial response, the client MUST send a single pad character
    ("=").  This indicates that the response is present, but is a zero-
    length string.

    When decoding the BASE64 [RFC4648] data in the initial client
    response, decoding errors MUST be treated as IMAP [RFC3501] would
    handle them in any normal SASL client response.  In particular, the
    server should check for any characters not explicitly allowed by the
    BASE64 alphabet, as well as any sequence of BASE64 characters that
    contains the pad character ('=') anywhere other than the end of the
    string (e.g. "=AAA" and "AAA=BBB" are not allowed).

    Note: support and use of the initial client response is optional for
    both clients and servers.  Servers which implement this extension
    MUST support clients which omit the initial client response, and

    clients which implement this extension MUST NOT send an initial
    client response to servers which do not advertise the SASL-IR
    capability.  In such a situation, clients MUST fall back to an IMAP
    [RFC3501] compatible mode.

    If either the client or the server do not support the SASL-IR
    capability, a mechanism which uses an initial client response is
    negotiated using the challenge/response exchange described in
    [RFC3501], with an initial zero-length server challenge.


4.  Examples

    The following is an example authentication using the PLAIN (see
    [RFC4616]) SASL mechanism (under a TLS protection layer, see
    [RFC4346]) and an initial client response:

             ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS
            protection layer ...
         C: C01 CAPABILITY
         S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
         S: C01 OK Completed
         C: A01 AUTHENTICATE PLAIN dGVzdAB0ZXN0AHRlc3Q=
         S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)

    Note that even when a server supports this extension, the following
    negotiation (which does not use the initial response) is still valid
    and MUST be supported by the server:

             ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS
            protection layer ...
         C: C01 CAPABILITY
         S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
         S: C01 OK Completed
         C: A01 AUTHENTICATE PLAIN
             (note that there is a space following the "+" in the
            following line)
         S: +
         C: dGVzdAB0ZXN0AHRlc3Q=
         S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)

    The following is an example authentication using the SASL EXTERNAL
    mechanism (defined in [RFC4422]) under a TLS protection layer (see
    [RFC4346]) and an empty initial client response:

             ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS
            protection layer ...
         C: C01 CAPABILITY

         S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
            AUTH=EXTERNAL
         S: C01 OK Completed
         C: A01 AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL =
         S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)

    This is in contrast with the handling of such a situation when an
    initial response is omitted:

          ... client connects to server and negotiates a TLS protection
            layer ...
         C: C01 CAPABILITY
         S: * CAPABILITY IMAP4 IMAP4rev1 SASL-IR AUTH=PLAIN
            AUTH=EXTERNAL
         S: C01 OK Completed
         C: A01 AUTHENTICATE EXTERNAL
             (note that there is a space following the "+" in the
            following line)
         S: +
         C:
         S: A01 OK Success (tls protection)


5.  IANA Considerations

    The IANA is requested to add SASL-IR to the list of IMAP extensions.


6.  Security Considerations

    The extension defined in this document is subject to many of the
    Security Considerations defined in [RFC3501] and [RFC4422].

    Server implementations MUST treat the omission of an initial client
    response from the AUTHENTICATE command as defined by [RFC3501] (as
    if this extension did not exist).

    Although [RFC3501] has no express line length limitations, some
    implementations choose to enforce them anyway.  Such implementations
    MUST be aware that the addition of the initial response parameter to
    AUTHENTICATE may increase the maximum line length that IMAP parsers
    may expect to support.  Server implementations MUST be able to
    receive the largest possible initial client response that their
    supported mechanisms might receive.

7.  Formal Syntax

    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur
    Form [RFC4234] notation.  [RFC3501] defines the non-terminals
    capability, auth-type and base64.

        capability    =/ "SASL-IR"

        authenticate  = "AUTHENTICATE" SP auth-type [SP (base64 / "=")]
                        *(CRLF base64)
                                          ;;redefine AUTHENTICATE from
                        [RFC3501]
