1. Introduction

   Wireless LANs (WLANs) based on the IEEE 802.11 specifications [1] 
   are spreading widely due to their low cost, simplicity of 
   installation and broadband connectivity.  WLANs are being set up not
   only in private spaces such as the home and workplace, but also in 
   public spaces such as waiting areas and coffee shops as hotspots.  
   Thus, WLANs that are independently managed by different 
   organizations are starting to complementarily cover wide areas such
   an entire city.  In the near future, WLANs will continue to spread
   until they overlap to provide continuous coverage over a wide area,
   and they will then be the underlying basis of ubiquitous networks.

   In ubiquitous networks consisting of WLANs, mobile nodes (MNs) can 
   access the Internet through access points (APs) at any location.  
   MNs are very likely to traverse multiple WLANs divided into 
   different IP subnets during communications, because the coverage of
   an individual WLAN is relatively small.  As a result, the 
   communication is disconnected due to the change in IP address of the
   MN required for handover.

   To achieve continuous communication during handover, many mobility
   management schemes such as Mobile IP [2,3], mobile Stream Control
   Transmission Protocol (mSCTP) [4], and others [5,6,7] have been
   proposed.  These schemes use various movement detection methods for
   starting the handover process.  However, in [8], we showed that these
   movement detection methods result in the degradation of communication
   quality at WLAN handover initiation.  Furthermore, in ubiquitous
   networks, as the communication quality is often degraded due to both
   (1) reduction of signal strength due to the MN's movement and 
   intervening objects and (2) radio interference with other WLANs, 
   proposing a handover decision criterion that can detect both (1) and 
   (2) is a critical issue.  Thus, the main focus of this article is on

   handover decision criteria for avoiding degradation in communication 
   quality at handover initiation.  We first clarify problems of 
   handover decision criteria arising from existing mobility management 
   technologies, and then propose the number of frame retransmissions 
   on the Media Access Control (MAC) layer (layer 2) as a simple 
   heuristic for handover decisions to realize seamless and efficient 
   WLAN handover. 


2. Existing WLAN handover decision criteria

   Handover decision criteria used by existing mobility management 
   technologies can be classified according to the information measured 
   on upper/lower layers.  (An upper layer is Layer 3 or above, and a 
   lower layer is Layer 2 or below.)  In [8], we investigated the 
   impact of existing handover decision criteria on communication 
   quality at handover initiation.  In this section, we clarify 
   characteristics of the existing handover decision criteria on 
   upper/lower layers.

2.1 Handover decision criteria on upper layers

   Packet loss (including data/signaling packets) and RTT are commonly 
   used as handover decision criteria in existing handover technologies 
   [2,3,6,7,9].  In [8], through simulation experiments, we showed that 
   the communication quality has already been degraded even when an MN 
   starts the handover process just after detecting the occurrence of a
   packet loss or an increase of RTT.  In a WLAN, communication quality 
   is degraded due to deterioration in the wireless link condition even 
   if packet loss does not occur or RTT does not seriously increase.  
   Therefore, these criteria on upper layers cannot detect abrupt 
   fluctuations of wireless link condition reliably and promptly.  
   To avoid degradation of communication quality at handover 
   initiation, it is essential to effectively detect deterioration in 
   the wireless link condition.

2.2 Handover decision criteria on lower layers

   Wireless signal strength is usually considered as a handover 
   decision criterion on lower layers [4,10].  Signal strength can 
   provide information about a wireless link condition directly from 
   the Physical Layer.  However, properly detecting deterioration in 
   communication quality caused by fluctuations of signal strength is 
   very difficult for an MN, because the signal strength may fluctuate 
   abruptly due to the distance from an AP and any interfering objects 
   located between the MN and the AP.

   Furthermore, in ubiquitous networks consisting of WLANs, degradation 
   of communication quality due to radio interference is common.  
   However, MNs cannot detect this type of degradation by assessing the 
   signal strength.  Thus, to maintain communication quality during 
   handover, an MN should be able to detect both the reduction of 
   signal strength and the radio interference.

draft-shigeru-simple-heuristic-wlan-handover-02.txt           March 2007
   In addition, it is very difficult for signal strength to set a 
   threshold to start the handover process, because the allowable range 
   of signal strength (Received Signal Strength Indicator: RSSI) 
   depends on each vendor, e.g., Cisco chooses 100 as RSSI-max while 
   the Atheros chipset chooses 60 [10].  Therefore, monitoring signal 
   strength is insufficient to avoid degradation in communication 
   quality at handover initiation.


3. The number of frame retransmissions

   As described in Section 2.2, to avoid degradation in communication 
   quality at WLAN handover initiation, a handover decision criterion 
   should reliably and promptly detect degradation of communication 
   quality due to both (1) reduction of signal strength and (2) radio 
   interference.  We propose the number of frame retransmissions as a 
   simple heuristic for handover decisions which satisfies these two 
   requirements [8,12,13].

3.1 Frame retransmission mechanism of IEEE 802.11

   We will outline the frame retransmission mechanism of IEEE 802.11.  
   In the IEEE 802.11 specifications [1], when a data or an ACK frame 
   is lost over a WLAN, the sender (e.g., an MN) retransmits the same 
   data frame to the receiver (e.g., an AP) until the number of frame 
   retransmissions reaches a predetermined retry limit.  If RTS 
   (Request To Send)/CTS (Clear To Send) is applied, the retry limit is 
   set to four; otherwise, it is seven. (These values actually depend 
   on each vendor.)  Therefore, a data frame can be retransmitted a 
   maximum of four or seven times (the initial transmission and 
   three/six retransmissions), if necessary.  If the MN does not 
   receive an ACK frame within the retry limit, it treats the data 
   frame as a lost packet.  In addition, RTT increases due to 
   retransmissions over a WLAN.  Therefore, we can see that a data 
   frame inherently experiences retransmissions over a WLAN before the 
   occurrence of packet loss or the increase of RTT, irrespective of 
   the RTS/CTS.

3.2 Advantages

   Use of the number of frame retransmissions has the following three 
   advantages: (i) detection of reduction of signal strength, (ii) 
   radio interference detection, and (iii) ease of setting of the 
   threshold triggering the handover processes.  First, when the MN 
   moves during communication, the wireless link condition is degraded 
   due to the distance from the AP and any interfering objects located 
   between the MN and the AP.  As described in Section 3.1, a data 
   frame will experience retransmissions due to the degradation of the 
   wireless link condition before the occurrence of packet loss or the 
   increase of RTT.  Thus, if the number of frame retransmissions is 
   used as a handover decision criterion, the MN can detect the 
   degradation of wireless link condition due to its own movement and 
   intervening objects before the communication quality is actually 
   degraded.

Kashihara, et al.       Expires: September 2, 2007              [Page 4]

draft-shigeru-simple-heuristic-wlan-handover-02.txt           March 2007

   Next, in radio interference environments, the number of frame 
   retransmissions has another advantage that the signal strength 
   criterion can never imitate.  For instance, with signal strength, 
   the MN cannot detect the communication quality due to the radio 
   interference either, because signal strength is not influenced by 
   radio interference at all.  However, in radio interference 
   environments, frame retransmissions frequently occur due to 
   collisions between transmitted frames.  As a result, the 
   communication quality is degraded.  Therefore, using the number of 
   frame retransmissions, the MN can detect degradation of 
   communication quality due to radio interference.

   Lastly, ease of determination of the threshold triggering the 
   handover processes should be noted here.  As mentioned earlier, 
   signal strength is measured in different ways by each vendor, so 
   that it is necessary to set a different suitable threshold for each 
   WLAN card.  The determination of an appropriate threshold, thus, 
   depends upon vendors' implementation of measures.  On the other 
   hand, as frame retransmissions can be handled in the same manner in 
   all WLAN cards, we can set the same threshold for every WLAN card, 
   unlike the signal strength.  In addition, we can simply set the 
   threshold by plain numbers (e.g., 1, 2, 3,..., n).

3.3 Disadvantages

   Although we described the advantages of the number of frame 
   retransmissions in the previous section, it also has some 
   disadvantages.  These disadvantages are as follows: (I) an MN cannot 
   detect change in wireless link condition without transmission of 
   data frames, and (II) cross-layer architecture is indispensable to 
   notify the existing mobility management technologies on upper layers 
   of the number of frame retransmissions.  First, the number of frame 
   retransmissions cannot be measured until data frames are sent.  For 
   instance, the MN cannot estimate the wireless link condition of a 
   new AP by the number of frame retransmissions before associating 
   with the new AP.  In this case, another criterion, e.g., signal 
   strength, is necessary to estimate the wireless link condition.  
   Therefore, an MN need to utilize signal strength to detect wireless 
   link quality when it has no transmission data.  Next, to introduce 
   this heuristic into the existing mobility management technologies, 
   as the information held in each layer cannot be accessed from 
   different layers due to the concept of the traditional layered 
   architecture, a cross-layer architecture is necessary for achieving 
   accessibility from different layers.

3.4 Consideration

   The number of frame retransmissions has a potential to properly 
   indicate wireless link condition influenced by reduction in signal 
   strength or radio interference.  However, it is still insufficient to
   achieve a seamless handover.  Common WLANs employ a function of auto
   rate fallback (ARF).  A method of ARF is not specified in [1], and
   depends on vendors.  When frame retransmissions are occurred, a 


Kashihara, et al.       Expires: September 2, 2007              [Page 5]

draft-shigeru-simple-heuristic-wlan-handover-02.txt           March 2007

   sender lowers transfer speed of WLAN to maintain communication 
   quality and thus frame retransmissions are reduced.  As a result, 
   when the number of frame retransmissions becomes large, the transfer
   speed has already been the lowest value, e.g., 1 Mb/s in 802.11b, at 
   starting a handover.  In non real-time applications, the degradation 
   in communication quality, i.e., throughput, is significant problem.
   Therefore, to maintain the communication quality, the transfer speed
   controlled by ARF is also necessary to be considered with the number
   of frame retransmissions.  
  
   In WLANs, MNs share the wireless media.  When many MNs exist in a 
   WLAN, waiting time to send frames in the WLAN becomes larger.  In 
   real-time applications, such as VoIP, an application layer passes 
   data packets to a WLAN interface at fixed rate.  At this time, when 
   the sending speed of application is faster than waiting time to send 
   frames, the queue length of a WLAN interface buffer increases.  As a 
   result, as RTT or jitter becomes large, communication quality may not
   be maintained.  Therefore, the queue length of interface buffer is 
   also useful information as an additional indicator to maintain 
   communication quality in real-time applications.


4. Handover management scheme based on the number of frame 
   retransmissions

   In [12, 14, 16], we proposed a handover management scheme based on 
   the number of frame retransmissions.  In Section 4.1, we briefly 
   introduce our handover management mechanism as an example of handover
   using the number of frame retransmissions.  We then describe 
   consideration of our proposed method.

4.1 Proposed method.

   Our handover mechanism takes a multihoming approach and a cross-layer
   approach in which the transport layer uses L2 information (i.e., the
   number of frame retransmissions).   That is, an MN has two WLAN 
   interfaces, and the handover manager (HM) on transport layer controls
   the handover process considering the number of frame retransmissions.
   As illustrated below, we assume that an MN with two WLAN interfaces 
   (IF1, IF2) connects with two different WLAN carriers (AP1, AP2), and 
   initially communicates with the CN through IF1.

   In our handover management scheme, an MN can flexibly select an 
   optimal WLAN considering the wireless link condition.  We outline 
   the operation of handover management scheme.  The MN associates with
   two APs by using two WLAN interfaces before handover in advance, 
   i.e., the MN has two different IP addresses.  When the wireless link 
   condition of AP1 through IF1 is getting worse, the HM switches to
   multi-path transmission to prevent packet loss during handover and to
   investigate the condition of another wireless link (AP2).  However, 
   the HM should return to single-path transmission on a stable wireless
   link as quickly as possible, because the network load is doubled by
   multi-path transmission in which the same data are sent through both 
   interfaces.  Therefore, in multi-path transmission, if the condition 
   of either wireless link is getting better, the HM immediately returns
   to single-path transmission.  In our scheme, we employ the number of 
   retransmissions to detect the change in a wireless link condition.  
   The MAC layer on each interface informs the HM of the number of frame
   retransmissions, and the HM determines the wireless link condition 
   for each interface from this number.  In this way, the HM selects 
   either single-path or multi-path transmission based on the wireless 
   link condition, i.e., the number of frame retransmissions.  As a 
   result, the HM can maintain communication quality while properly 
   switching between single-path and multi-path transmission during 
   handover.  We are now implementing TCP and UDP using the number of 
   frame retransmissions as a handover decision criterion.  In UDP 
   (VoIP) version, we have implemented the prototype system on Linux 
   Kernel, and presented the demonstration at Mobihoc 2006 [15].  We 
   also think the number of frame retransmissions is applied to not 
   only our approach but also another approaches such as MIP and mSCTP.

4.2 Consideration

   In [12, 14, 16], as an overlap area between two WLANs is assumed to 
   be large enough to maintain communication quality during handover, 


Kashihara, et al.       Expires: September 2, 2007              [Page 7]

draft-shigeru-simple-heuristic-wlan-handover-02.txt           March 2007

   the threshold to switch between single-path and multi-path 
   transmissions is a fixed value. However, in a real environment, 
   an overlap area is not always large.  If an overlap area is small, 
   an MN may frequently switch between single-path and multi-path 
   transmissions under a fixed threshold.  To put it concretely, in the 
   case of small overlap area, even if the overlap area is insufficient 
   to maintain communication quality due to long distance to the next 
   AP, an MN starts a handover when frame retransmissions occur in the 
   current WLAN.  As a result, the communication quality may degrade 
   because of multiple and continuous handovers.  Therefore, to achieve 
   more sophisticated handover management, the threshold to switch 
   between single-path and multi-path transmissions need to be 
   dynamically changed according to the size of an overlap area.


5. Conclusion

   In this article, we have discussed handover decision criteria to 
   maintain communication quality during handover.  In particular, we 
   mentioned that the degradation of communication quality at handover 
   initiation becomes a critical issue.  To seamlessly move across 
   multiple WLANs divided into different IP subnets, an MN should 
   execute the handover process while reliably and promptly detecting 
   degradation of the wireless link condition before deterioration of 
   communication quality actually occurs.  Next, we argued that a 
   handover decision criterion should satisfy the following two 
   requirements: (1) detection of reduction of signal strength, and (2) 
   radio interference detection.  To satisfy these two requirements, we 
   proposed the number of frame retransmissions as a simple heuristic 
   for the handover decision, and introduced our proposed scheme using 
   the number of frame retransmissions.  Although this heuristic has 
   some disadvantages, we consider that the number of frame 
   retransmissions is an important heuristic to maintain communication 
   quality during WLAN handover.
