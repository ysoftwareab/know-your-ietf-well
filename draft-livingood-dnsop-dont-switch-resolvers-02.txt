     In Case of DNSSEC Validation Failures, Do Not Change Resolvers
             draft-livingood-dnsop-dont-switch-resolvers-02

Abstract

   DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) are being widely deployed,
   particularly via validating resolvers.  However, domain signing tools
   and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as is the case for
   non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and processes.  As a
   result, some DNSSEC validation failures may occur.  When these
   failures do occur, end users should not change to a non-validating
   DNS resolver.

1.  Introduction

   The Domain Name System (DNS), DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC), and
   related operational practices are defined extensively [RFC1034]
   [RFC1035] [RFC4033] [RFC4034] [RFC4035] [RFC4398] [RFC4509] [RFC6781]
   [RFC5155].

   DNSSEC has now entered widespread deployment.  However, domain
   signing tools and processes are not yet as mature and reliable as is
   the case for non-DNSSEC-related domain administration tools and
   processes.  As a result, some DNSSEC validation failures may occur.
   When these failures do occur, end users should not change to a non-
   validating DNS resolver.

2.  Domain Validation Failures

   A domain name can fail validation for two general reasons, an actual
   security failure such as due to an attack or compromise of some sort,
   or as a result of misconfiguration (mistake) on the part of an domain
   administrator.  There is no way for end users to discern which of
   these issues has caused a DNSSEC-signed domain to fail validation,
   and end users should therefore assume that it may be due to an actual
   security problem.

3.  Misunderstanding DNSSEC Validation Failures

   End users may incorrectly interpret the failure to reach a domain due
   to DNSSEC-related misconfiguration as their ISP or DNS resolver
   operator purposely blocking access to the domain, or as a
   performance-related failure on the part of their ISP. In reality,
   these failures may be due to a security issue of which the end user
   is not aware.

4.  Comparison to Other DNS Misconfigurations

   Authoritative DNS-related mistakes and errors typically affect the
   entire Internet, and all DNS recursive resolver operators equally.
   So for example, in an A record is incorrect, an end user would get
   the incorrect record in a DNS response no matter what resolver they
   used.

   In contrast to this, DNSSEC-related mistakes, errors, or validation
   security failures would only affect end users of validating
   resolvers.

5.  Switching to a Non-Validating Resolver is NOT Recommended

   As noted in Section 3 some end users may not understand why a domain
   fails to validate on one network but not another (or with one DNS
   resolver but not another) Section 4. As a result, they may consider
   switching to an alternative, non-validating resolver themselves.  But
   if a domain fails DNSSEC validation and is inaccessible, this could
   very well be due to a security-related issue.  Changing to a non-
   validating resolver is a critical security downgrade and is not well
   advised.

   As a recommended best practice: In order to be as safe and secure as
   possible, end users should not change to DNS servers that do not
   perform DNSSEC validation as a workaround.

   Even if a website in a domain seems to look "normal" and valid,
   according to the DNSSEC protocol, that domain is not secure.  Domains
   that fail DNSSEC validation may fail due to an actual security
   incident or compromise, and may be in control of hackers or there
   could be other significant security issues with the domain.  Thus,
   switching to a non-validating resolver to restore access to a domain
   that fails DNSSEC validation is NOT recommended and is potentially
   harmful to end user security.

6.  Other Considerations

6.1.  Security Considerations

   The use of a non-validating DNS recursive resolver has comparatively
   less security capabilities than a validating resolver, since one
   implements DNS Security Extensions and one does not.

   In the case of a DNSSEC validation failure, if an end user changes to
   a non-validating resolver they may subject themselves to increased
   security risks and threats against which DNS Security Extensions may
   have provided protection.

6.2.  Recommendations for Validating Resolver Operators

   Since it is not recommended that end users change to non-validating
   resolvers, operators of validating resolvers may wish to consider
   what tools they might make available to their end users to assist in
   these cases.  For example, there may be a DNS looking glass that
   enables someone to use a web page or other tool to remotely check DNS
   resolution on the operator's servers, as well as possibly another
   operator's servers.  Such a web page or tool may also provide a link
   to independent third party sites or tools that can confirm whether or
   not a DNSSEC-related error is present, of which several exist today
   (e.g.  DNSViz [1], Verisign DNSSEC Debugger [2]). Finally, the
   operator may also wish to consider a web page form or other tool to
   enable end users to report possible DNS resolution issues.

6.3.  Privacy Considerations

   There are no privacy considerations in this document.

6.4.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations in this document.
