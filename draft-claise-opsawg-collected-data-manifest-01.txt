           A Data Manifest for Contextualized Telemetry Data
             draft-claise-opsawg-collected-data-manifest-01

Abstract

   Most network equipment feature telemetry as a mean to monitoring
   their status.  Several protocols exist to this end, for example, the
   model-driven telemetry governed by YANG models.  Some of these
   protocols provide the data itself, without any contextual information
   about the collection method.  This can render the data unusable if
   that context is lost, for instance when the data is stored without
   the relevant information.  This document proposes a YANG data model
   to store that contextual information along with the collected data in
   order to keep the collected data exploitable in the future.

   Data Collection Manifest: part of the Data Manifest that completely
   characterizes how and when the telemetry information was metered.

2.  Introduction

   Network elements use Model-driven Telemetry (MDT) to continuously
   stream information, including both counters and state information.
   This streamed information is used for network monitoring or closed-
   loop automation.  This streamed data can also be stored in a database
   (sometimes called a big data lake) for further analysis.

   When streaming YANG-structured data with YANG-Push [RFC8641], there
   is a semantic definition in the corresponding YANG module definition.
   On top of that definition, it is also important to maintain
   contextual information about the collection environment.

   As an example, a database could store a time series representing the
   evolution of a specific counter.  When analyzing the data, it's
   important to understand that this counter was requested from the
   network element at specific cadence, as this exact cadence might not
   be observed in the time series, potentially implying that the network
   element was under stress.  The same time series might report some
   values as 0 or might even omit some values.  This might be explained
   by a too small observation period, compared to the minimum-observed-
   period [I-D.claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection].  Again, knowing
   the conditions under which the counter was collected and streamed is
   crucial.  Indeed, taking into account the value of 0 might lead to a
   wrong conclusion that the counter dropped to zero.  This document
   specifies the data collection manifest, which contains the required
   information to characterize how and when the telemetry information
   was metered.

   Precisely characterizing the source used for producing the data (that
   is the platform manifest) may also be useful to complete the data
   collection context.  As an example, knowing the exact device software
   specification might reveal a particularity in the observed data,
   explained by a specific bug, or a specific bug fix.  This is also
   necessary to ensure the reliability of the collected data.  On top of
   that, in particular for MDT, it is crucial to know the set of YANG
   modules supported by the device, along with their deviations.  In
   some cases, there might even be some backwards incompatible changes
   in native modules between one OS version to the next one.  This
   information must be compiled in a platform manifest that must be
   included in the data manifest.

   Some related YANG modules have been specified to retrieve the device
   capabilities:

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest              March 2022


   *  [RFC9196] which models the device capabilities regarding the
      production and export of telemetry data.

   *  [I-D.claise-netconf-metadata-for-collection], which is based on
      the previous draft to define the optimal settings to stream
      specific items (i.e., per path).

   While these related YANG modules are important to discover the
   capabilities before applying the telemetry configuration (such as on-
   change), some of their content is part of the context for the
   streamed data.  Our goal is to compile the data manifest for a given
   device.  This manifest contains two parts, the platform manifest and
   the data collection manifest.  The platform manifest is "pretty"
   stable and should change only when the device is updated or patched.
   On the other hand, the data collection manifest is likely to change
   each time a new MDT subscription is requested and might even change
   if the device load increases and collection periods are updated.  To
   separate these two parts, we enclose each of them in its own module.
   We first present the module for the platform manifest in Section 3
   and then the module for the data collection manifest in Section 4.
   The full data manifest is obtained by combining these two modules.
   We explain in Section 5 how the data-manifest can be collected and
   how collected data is mapped to the data manifest.

   parameters ('platform', 'software-version', 'software-flavor', 'os-

   version', 'os-type') that are aligned with the YANG Catalog
   www.yangcatalog.org [I-D.clacla-netmod-model-catalog] so that the
   YANG catalog could be used to retrieve the YANG modules a posteriori.

   The platform manifest also includes the contents of the YANG Library
   [RFC8525].  That module set is particularly useful to define the
   paths, as they are based on module names.  Similarly, this module
   defines the available datastores, which can be referred to from the
   data-manifest, if necessary.  If supported by the device, fetching
   metrics from a specific datastore could enable some specific
   usecases: monitoring configuration before it is committed, comparing
   between the configuration and operational datastore.

   Alternatively, the set of available YANG modules on the device can be
   described via packages-set which contains a list of references to
   YANG Packages [I-D.ietf-netmod-yang-packages].

   The data-collection container contains the information related to
   individual items collection.  This subtree currently contains only
   information about MDT collection.  It could be extended and
   extendable to represent other kinds of data collection.

   MDT collection is organized in subscriptions.  A given collector can
   subscribe to one ore more subscriptions that usually contain a list
   of paths.  Such a collector only needs the data manifest for
   subscriptions it subscribed to.  The data manifest for MDT is
   organized by subscriptions as well so that a collector can select
   only its subscriptions.

   We now have a chicken-and-egg issue if the collector collects the
   data-manifest via MDT and wants the data-manifest for the data-
   manifest subscription.  First the collector will collect the actual
   paths that it needs in subscription A.  Once it has the subscription
   id for A, it will need an additional subscription B for the data
   manifest of paths in A.  Then, it would need another subscription C
   to fetch the data manifest for the subscription B and so on... A
   possible solution would be adding in the "mdt" container an
   additional list in that contains the data manifest for every path
   that is a data manifest.  By including that list in subscription B,
   the collector would have the information about subscription B here.

   The "datastore" leaf of the subscription container specifies from
   which datastore the yang paths are streamed.

   Within a given collection subscription, the granularity of the
   collection is defined by the path.  Note that all devices do not
   support an arbitrary granularity up to the leaf, usually for
   performance reasons.  Each path currently collected by the device
   should show up in the mdt-path-data-manifest list.

   For each path, the collection context must be specified including:

   *  'on-change': when set to true, an update is sent as soon as and
      only when a value changes.  This is also known as Event-Driven
      Telemetry (EDT).  When set to false, the values are sent
      regularly.

   *  'suppress-redundancy' (only when 'on-change' is false): reduce
      bandwidth usage by sending a regular update only if the value is
      different from the previous update.

   *  'requested-period' (only when 'on-change' is false): period
      between two updates requested by the client for this path

   *  'actual-period' (only when 'on-change 'is false): actual period
      retained by the platform between two updates.  That period could
      be larger than the requested one as the router can adjust it for
      performance reasons.

   This information is crucial to understand the collected values.  For
   instance, the 'on-change' and 'suppress-redundancy' options, if set,
   might remove a lot of messages from the database because values are
   sent only when there is a change.

5.  Collecting Data Manifest and Mapping Data to Data Manifest

   This data manifest instance file MUST be streamed all with the data
   and stored along with the collected data.  In case the collected data
   are moved to a different place (typically a database), the data
   manifest MUST follow the collected data.  This can render the data
   unusable if that context is lost, for instance when the data is
   stored without the relevant information.  The data manifest MUST be
   updated when the data manifest information changes (for example, when
   a router is upgraded), when a new telemetry subscription is
   configured, or when the telemetry subscription paremeters change.

   The data should be mapped to the data manifest.  Since the data
   manifest will not change as frequently as the data itself, it makes
   sense to map several data to the same data manifest.  Somehow, the
   collected data must include a metadata pointing to the corresponding
   data manifest.

   The platform manifest is likely to remain the same until the device
   is updated.  So, the platform manifest only needs to be collected
   once per streaming session and updated after a device reboot.

Internet-Draft           Telemetry Data Manifest              March 2022


   As this draft specifically focuses on giving context on data
   collected via streamed telemetry, we can assume that a streaming
   telemetry system is available.  Collecting the data and platform
   manifests can be done either by reusing that streaming telemetry
   system (in-band) or using another system (out-of-band), for instance
   by adding headers or saving manifests into files.

   We propose to reuse the existing telemetry system (in-band approach)
   in order to lower the efforts for implementing this draft.  To enable
   a platform supporting streaming telemetry to also support data
   collection manifests, it is sufficient that this device supports the
   models from Section 3 and Section 4.  Recall that each type of
   manifest has its own rough frequency update, i.e. at reboot for the
   platform manifest and at new subscription or CPU load variation for
   the data manifest.  The data manifest MUST be streamed with the YANG-
   Push on-change feature [RFC8641] (also called event-driven
   telemetry).

5.1.  Mapping Collected Data to the Data Manifest

   With MDT, a particular datapoint is always associated to a path that
   is itself part of a subscription.  In order to enable a posteriori
   retrieval of the data manifest associated to a datapoint, the
   collector must:

   *  keep the path in the metadata of the collected values

   *  collect as well the data-manifest for the subscription and path
      associated to the datapoint.

   With this information, to retrieve the data manifest from the
   datapoint, the following happens:

   *  the path is retrieved from the datapoint metadata

   *  the data-manifest for that path is retrieved by looking up on the
      collected data-manifest.

   In that scenario, the reliability of the collection of the data
   manifest is the same as the reliability of the data collection
   itself, since the data manifest is like any other data.  For
   telemetry based on gRPC for instance, a disconnection to the server
   would be detected as the HTTP connection would fail.

6.  Example

   Below is an example of a data-manifest file:

   The file above contains the data manifest for paths collected in the
   subscription with id 4242.  The requested period for both path is
   this subscription was 100ms, however the status of the interface
   could only be collected every 10s.

7.  Security Considerations

   As we are reusing an existing telemetry system, the security
   considerations lies with the new content divulged in the new
   manifests.  Appropriate access control must be associated to the
   corresponding leafs and containers.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

9.  Contributors

10.  Open Issues

   *  Do we want to the hardware specifications, next to the OS
      information?  How to fully characterize a virtual device?  Do we
      need to include the vendor (as PEN for instance
      https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/enterprise-
      numbers) ?

   *  Do we want to handle the absence of values, i.e. add information
      about missed collection or errors in the collection context ? It
      could also explain why some values are missing.  On the other
      hand, this might also be out scope.

   *  How do we handle other kinds of collection than MDT like netflow,
      SNMP, CLI ? How do we map the collected data to the data-manifest
      ?

   *  Align the terms with the YANG Push specifications.  Ex: path to
      subscription (TBC)

   *  Better explain the on-change example.

   *  Regarding the inclusion of ietf-yang-library in our module, do we
      want to include as well the changes from ietf-yang-library-
      revisions?  What if other information are present in the yang-
      libary from the platform?  Should we use a YANG mount to capture
      them as well (they would not be captured with our use of the main
      yang-library grouping).

   *  Henk: how does this interact with SBOM effort?

   *  Eliot: important to give integrity of the information a lot of
      thought

   *  Attacker model to be considered.
