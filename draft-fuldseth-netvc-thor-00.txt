Internet-Draft              Thor Video Codec                   July 2015


1.  Introduction

   This document provides a high-level description of the Thor video
   codec.  Thor is designed to achieve high compression efficiency with
   moderate complexity, using the well-known hybrid video coding
   approach of motion-compensated prediction and transform coding.

   The Thor video codec is a block-based hybrid video codec similar in
   structure to widespread standards.  The high level encoder and
   decoder structures are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2
   respectively.

   The remainder of this document is organized as follows.  First, some
   requirements language and terms are defined.  Block structures are
   described in detail, followed by intra-frame prediction techniques,
   inter-frame prediction techniques, transforms, quantization, loop
   filters, entropy coding, and finally high level syntax.

   An open source reference implementation will be available soon at

2.2.  Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms.

      SB: Super Block - 64x64 block (luma pixels) which can be divided
      into CBs.

      CB: Coding Block - Subdivision of a SB, down to 8x8 (luma pixels).

      PB: Prediction Block - Subdivision of a CB, into 1, 2 or 4 equal
      blocks.

      TB: Transform Block - Subdivision of a CB, into 1 or 4 equal
      blocks.

3.  Block Structure

3.1.  Super Blocks and Coding Blocks

   Each frame is divided into 64x64 Super Blocks (SB) which are
   processed in raster-scan order.  Each SB can be divided into Coding
   Blocks (CB) using a quad-tree structure.  The smallest allowed CB
   size is 8x8 luma pixels.  The four CBs of a larger block are coded/
   signaled in the following order; upleft, downleft, upright, and
   downright.

   The following modes are signaled at the CB level:

   o  Intra

   o  Inter0 (MV index, no residual information)

   o  Inter1 (MV index, residual information)

   o  Inter2 (explicit motion information, residual information)

   o  Bi-Prediction (explicit motion information, residual information)

3.2.  Special Processing at Frame Boundaries

   At frame boundaries some square blocks might not be complete.  For
   example, for 1920x1080 resolutions, the bottom row would consist of
   rectangular blocks of size 64x56.  Rectangular blocks at frame
   boundaries are handled as follows.  For each rectangular block, send
   one bit to choose between:

   o  A rectangular inter0 block and

   o  Further split.

   For the bottom part of a 1920x1080 frame, this implies the following:

   o  For each 64x56 block, transmit one bit to signal a 64x56 inter0
      block or a split into two 32x32 blocks and two 32x24 blocks.

   o  For each 32x24 block, transmit one bit to signal a 32x24 inter0
      block or a split into two 16x16 blocks and two 16x8 blocks.

   o  For each 16x8 block, transmit one bit to signal a 16x8 inter0
      block or a split into two 8x8 blocks.

   Two examples of handling 64x56 blocks at the bottom row of a
   1920x1080 frame are shown in Figure 3 and Figure 4 respectively.

3.4.  Prediction Blocks

   A CB can also be divided into smaller prediction blocks (PBs) for the
   purpose of motion-compensated prediction.  Horizontal, vertical and
   quad split is used.

4.  Intra Prediction

   8 modes are used:

   1.  DC

   2.  Vertical (V)

   3.  Horizontal (H)

   4.  Upupright (north-northeast)

   5.  Upupleft (north-northwest)

   6.  Upleft (northwest)

   7.  Upleftleft (west-northwest)

   8.  Downleftleft (west-southwest)

   The definition of DC, vertical, and horizontal modes are
   straightforward.

   The upright and upleft directions are exactly 45 degrees.

   The upupright, upupleft, and upleftleft directions are equal to
   arctan(1/2) from the horizontal or vertical direction, since they are
   defined by going one pixel horizontally and two pixels vertically (or
   vice versa).

   For the 5 angular intra modes (i.e. angle different from 90 degrees),
   the pixels of the neighbor blocks are filtered before they are used
   for prediction:

   y(n) = (x(n-1) + 2*x(n) + x(n+1) + 2)/4

   For the angular intra modes that are not 45 degrees, the prediction
   sometimes requires sample values at a half-pixel position.  These
   sample values are determined by an additional filter:

   z(n + 1/2) = (y(n) + y(n+1))/2

5.  Inter Prediction

5.1.  Multiple Reference Frames

   Multiple reference frames are currently implemented as follows.

   o  Use a sliding-window process to keep the N most recent
      reconstructed frames in memory.  The value of N is signaled in the
      sequence header.

   o  In the frame header, signal which of these frames shall be active
      for the current frame.

   o  For each CB, signal which of the active frames to be used for MC.

   Combined with re-ordering, this allows for MPEG-1 style B frames.

   A desirable extension is to allow long-term reference frames in
   addition to the short-term reference frames defined by the sliding-
   window process.

5.2.  Bi-Prediction

   In case of bi-prediction, two reference indices and two motion
   vectors are signaled per CB.  In the current version, PB-split is not
   allowed in bi-prediction mode.  Sub-pixel interpolation is performed
   for each motion vector/reference index separately before doing an
   average between the two predicted blocks:

   p(x,y) = (p0(x,y) + p1(x,y))/2

5.3.  Sub-Pixel Interpolation

5.3.1.  Luma Poly-phase Filter

   Inter prediction uses traditional block-based motion compensated
   prediction with quarter pixel resolution.  A separable 6-tap poly-
   phase filter is the basis method for doing MC with sub-pixel
   accuracy.  The luma filter coefficients are as follows:

   1/4 phase: [3,-15,111,37,-10,2]/128

   2/4 phase: [3,-17,78,78,-17,3]/128

   3/4 phase: [2,-10,37,111,-15,3]/128

   With reference to Figure 5, a fractional sample value, e.g. i0,0
   which has a phase of 1/4 in the horizontal dimension and a phase of
   1/2 in the vertical dimension is calculated as follows:

   a0,j = 3*A-2,i - 15*A-1,i + 111*A0,i + 37*A1,i - 10*A2,i + 2*A3,i

   where j = -2,...,3

   i0,0 = (3*a0,-2 - 17*a0,-1 + 78*a0,0 + 78*a0,1 - 17*a0,2 + 3*a0,3 +
   8192)/16384

   However, some of the sub-pixel positions have different filters which
   can be non-separable and/or have different filter coefficients.  The
   minimum sub-block size is 8x8.

   7/8 phase: [-2, 10, 58, -2]/64

5.4.  Motion Vector Coding

5.4.1.  Inter0 and Inter1 Modes

   Inter0 and inter1 modes imply signaling of a motion vector index to
   choose a motion vector from a list of candidate motion vectors with
   associated reference frame index.  A list of motion vector candidates
   are derived from at most two different neighbor blocks, each having a
   unique motion vector/reference frame index.  Signaling of the motion
   vector index uses 0 or 1 bit, dependent on the number of unique
   motion vector candidates.  If the chosen neighbor block is coded in
   bi-prediction mode, the inter0 or inter1 block inherits both motion
   vectors, both reference indices and the bi-prediction property of the
   neighbor block.

   For block sizes less than 64x64, inter0 has only one motion vector
   candidate, and its value is always zero.

   Which neighbor blocks to use for motion vector candidates depends on
   the availability of the neighbor blocks (i.e. whether the neighbor
   blocks have already been coded, belong to the same slice and are not
   outside the frame boundaries).  Four different availabilities, U, UR,
   L, and LL, are defined as illustrated in Figure 6.  If the neighbor
   block is intra it is considered to be available but with a zero
   motion vector.

5.4.2.  Inter2 and Bi-Prediction Modes

   Motion vectors are coded using motion vector prediction.  The motion
   vector predictor is defined as the median of the motion vectors from
   three neighbor blocks.  Definition of the motion vector predictor
   uses the same definition of availability and neighbors as in Figure 6
   and Figure 7 respectively.  The three vectors used for median
   filtering depends on the availability of neighbor blocks as shown in
   Table 2.  If the neighbor block is coded in bi-prediction mode, only
   the first motion vector (in transmission order), MV0, is used as
   input to the median operator.

6.  Transforms

   Transforms are applied at the TB or CB level, implying that transform
   sizes range from 4x4 to 64x64.  The transforms form an embedded
   structure meaning the transform matrix elements of the smaller
   transforms can be extracted from the larger transforms.

7.  Quantization

   For the 32x32 and 64x64 transform sizes, only the 16x16 low frequency
   coefficients are quantized and transmitted.

   Quantizer step-size control is not implemented yet, but some sort of
   sub-frame control is desired.

   1.  For each vertical edge between two 8x8 blocks, calculate the
       following for each of line 2 and line 5 respectively:

       d = abs(a-b) + abs(c-d),

       where a and b, are on the left hand side of the block edge and c
       and d are on the right hand side of the block edge:

       a b | c d

   2.  For each line crossing the vertical edge, perform deblocking if
       and only if all of the following conditions are true:

       *  d2+d5 < beta(QP)

       *  The edge is also a transform block edge

       *  abs(mvx(left)) > 2, or abs(mvx(right)) > 2, or

          abs(mvy(left)) > 2, or abs(mvy(right)) > 2, or

          One of the transform blocks on each side of the edge has non-
          zero coefficients, or

          One of the transform blocks on each side of the edge is coded
          using intra mode.

   3.  If deblocking is performed, calculate a delta value as follows:

       delta = clip((18*(c-b) - 6*(d-a) + 16)/32,tc,-tc),

       where tc is a QP-dependent value.

   4.  Next, modify two pixels on each side of the block edge as
       follows:

       a' = a + delta/2

       b' = b + delta

       c' = c + delta

       d' = d + delta/2

   5.  The same procedure is followed for horizontal block edges.

   The relative positions of the samples, a, b, c, d and the motion
   vectors, MV, are illustrated in Figure 8.

8.1.2.  Chroma Deblocking

   Chroma deblocking is performed on a 4x4 grid as follows:

   1.  Delocking of the edge between two 4x4 blocks is performed if and
       only if:

       *  The pixels on either side of the block edge belongs to an
          intra block.

       *  The block edge is also an edge between two transform blocks.

   2.  If deblocking is performed, calculate a delta value as follows:

       delta = clip((4*(c-b) + (d-a) + 4)/8,tc,-tc),

       where tc is a QP-dependent value.

   3.  Next, modify one pixel on each side of the block edge as follows:

       b' = b + delta

       c' = c + delta

8.2.  Constrained Low Pass Filter (CLPF1)

   A low-pass filter is applied after the deblocking filter and operates
   on 64x64 block units as follows:

   o  64x64 blocks that are encoded as 64x64 inter0 with a zero MV are
      not subject to filtering.

Internet-Draft              Thor Video Codec                   July 2015


   o  For other 64x64 blocks, one bit (CLPFflag) is sent to signal
      filtering on/off.

   o  When the CLPFflag is equal to 1, perform filtering as follows:

      Delta = max(-1,min(1,(A+B+C+D-4X+2)>>2))

      X' = X + Delta

   The relative positions of the pixel values A, B, C, D, and X are
   shown in Figure 9.

         transform coefficients

9.2.4.  Super Mode

   For each block of size NxN (64>=N>8), the following mutually
   exclusive events are jointly encoded using a single VLC code as
   follows (example using 4 reference frames):

     INTER0      1
     SPLIT       01
     INTER1      001
     INTER2-REF0 0001
     INTRA       00001
     INTER2-REF1 000001
     INTER2-REF2 0000001
     INTER2-REF3 00000001
     BIPRED      00000000

   If less than 4 reference frames is used, a shorter VLC table is used.

   For each block of size 8x8, the following mutually exclusive events
   are jointly encoded using a single VLC code as follows (example using
   4 reference frames):

     INTER0      1
     INTER1      01
     INTER2-REF0 001
     INTRA       0001
     INTER2-REF1 00001
     INTER2-REF2 000001
     INTER2-REF3 0000001

Internet-Draft              Thor Video Codec                   July 2015


   Additionally, depending on information from the blocks to the left
   and above (meta data and CBP), a different sorting of the events can
   be used, e.g.:

     SPLIT       1
     INTER1      01
     INTER2-REF0 001
     INTER0      0001
     INTRA       00001
     INTER2-REF1 000001
     INTER2-REF2 0000001
     INTER2-REF3 00000001
     BIPRED      00000000

9.2.5.  CBP

   Calculate code as follows:

       if (tb-split == 0)

         N = 4*CBPV + 2*CBPU + CBPY

       else

         N = 8

   Map the value of N to code through a table lookup:

   code = table[N]

   where the purpose of the table lookup is the sort the different
   values of code according to decreasing probability (typically CBPY=1,
   CBPU=0, CBPV=0 having the highest probability).

   Use a different table depending on the values of CBPY in neighbor
   blocks (left and above).

   Encode the value of code using a systematic VLC code.

9.2.6.  Transform Coefficients

   Transform coefficient coding uses a traditional zig-zag scan pattern
   to convert a 2D array of quantized transform coefficients, coeff, to
   a 1D array of samples.  VLC coding of quantized transform
   coefficients starts from the low frequency end of the 1D array using
   two different modes; level-mode and run-mode, starting in level-mode:

   o  Level-mode

Internet-Draft              Thor Video Codec                   July 2015


      *  Encode each coefficient, coeff, separately

      *  Each coefficient is encoded by:

         +  The absolute value, level=abs(coeff), using a VLC code and

         +  If level > 0, the sign bit (sign=0 or sign=1 for coeff>0 and
            coeff<0 respectively).

      *  If coefficient N is zero, switch to run-mode, starting from
         coefficient N+1.

   o  Run-mode

      *  For each non-zero coefficient, encode the combined event of:

         1.  Length of the zero-run, i.e. the number of zeros since the
             last non-zero coefficient.

         2.  Whether or not level=abs(coeff) is greater than 1.

         3.  End of block (EOB) indicating that there are no more non-
             zero coefficients.

      *  Additionally, if level = 1, code the sign bit.

      *  Additionally, if level > 1 define code = 2*(level-2)+sign,

      *  If the absolute value of coefficient N is larger than 1, switch
         to level-mode, starting from coefficient N+1.

   Example

   Figure 10 illustrates an example where 16 quantized transform
   coefficients are encoded.
