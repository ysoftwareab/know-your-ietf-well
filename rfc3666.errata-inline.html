Abstract

   This document contains best current practice examples of Session
   Initiation Protocol (SIP) call flows showing interworking with the
   Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).  Elements in these call
   flows include SIP User Agents, SIP Proxy Servers, and PSTN Gateways.
   Scenarios include SIP to PSTN, PSTN to SIP, and PSTN to PSTN via SIP.
   PSTN telephony protocols are illustrated using ISDN (Integrated
   Services Digital Network), ISUP (ISDN User Part), and FGB (Feature
   Group B) circuit associated signaling.  PSTN calls are illustrated
   using global telephone numbers from the PSTN and private extensions
   served on by a PBX (Private Branch Exchange).  Call flow diagrams and
   message details are shown.

1.  Overview

   The call flows shown in this document were developed in the design of
   a SIP IP communications network.  They represent an example of a
   minimum set of functionality.

   It is the hope of the authors that this document will be useful for
   SIP implementers, designers, and protocol researchers alike and will
   help further the goal of a standard implementation of RFC 3261 [2].
   These flows represent carefully checked and working group reviewed
   scenarios of the most common SIP/PSTN interworking examples as a
   companion to the specifications.

   These call flows are based on the current version 2.0 of SIP in RFC
   3261 [2] with SDP usage described in RFC 3264 [3].  Other RFCs also
   comprise the SIP standard but are not used in this set of basic call
   flows.  The SIP/ISUP mapping is based on RFC 3398 [4].

   Various PSTN signaling protocols are illustrated in this document:
   ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), ISUP (ISDN User Part) and
   FGB (Feature Group B) circuit associated signaling.  This document
   shows mainly ANSI ISUP due to its practical origins.  However, as
   used in this document, the usage is virtually identical to the ITU-T
   International ISUP used as the reference in [4].

   Basic SIP call flow examples are contained in a companion document,
   RFC 3665 [10].

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1].

1.1.  General Assumptions

   A number of architecture, network, and protocol assumptions underlie
   the call flows in this document.  Note that these assumptions are not
   requirements.  They are outlined in this section so that they may be
   taken into consideration and to aid in the understanding of the call
   flow examples.

   The authentication of SIP User Agents in these example call flows is
   performed using HTTP Digest as defined in [3] and [5].

   Some Proxy Servers in these call flows insert Record-Route headers
   into requests to ensure that they are in the signaling path for
   future message exchanges.

   These flows show TLS, TCP, and UDP for transport.  SCTP could also be
   used.  See the discussion in RFC 3261 [2] for details on the
   transport issues for SIP.

   The SIP Proxy Server has access to a Location Service and other
   databases.  Information present in the Request-URI and the context
   (From header) is sufficient to determine to which proxy or gateway
   the message should be routed.  In most cases, a primary and secondary
   route will be determined in case of a Proxy or Gateway failure
   downstream.

   Gateways provide tones (ringing, busy, etc) and announcements to the
   PSTN side based on SIP response messages, or pass along audio in-band
   tones (ringing, busy tone, etc.) in an early media stream to the SIP
   side.

   The interactions between the Proxy and Gateway can be summarized as
   follows:

   -  The SIP Proxy Server performs digit analysis and lookup and
      locates the correct gateway.

   -  The SIP Proxy Server performs gateway location based on primary
      and secondary routing.

   Telephone numbers are usually represented as SIP URIs.  Note that an
   alternative is the use of the tel URI [6].

   This document shows typical examples of SIP/ISUP interworking.
   Although in the spirit of the SIP-T framework [7], these examples do
   not represent a complete implementation of the framework.  The
   examples here represent more of a minimal set of examples for very
   basic SIP to ISUP interworking, rather than the more complex goal of
   ISUP transparency.  In particular, there are NO examples of
   encapsulated ISUP in this document.  If present, these messages would
   show S/MIME encryption due to the sensitive nature of this
   information, as discussed in the SIP-T Framework security
   considerations section.  (Note - RFC 3204 [8] contains an example of
   an INVITE with encapsulated ISUP.)  See the Security Considerations
   section for a more detailed discussion on the security of these call
   flows.

   In ISUP, the Calling Party Number is abbreviated as CgPN and the
   Called Party Number is abbreviated as CdPN.  Other abbreviations
   include Numbering Plan Indicator (NPI) and Nature of Address (NOA).

1.2.  Legend for Message Flows

   Dashed lines (---) represent signaling messages that are mandatory to
   the call scenario.  These messages can be SIP or PSTN signaling.  The
   arrow indicates the direction of message flow.

   Double dashed lines (===) represent media paths between network
   elements.

   Messages with parentheses around their name represent optional
   messages.

   Messages are identified in the Figures as F1, F2, etc.  This
   references the message details in the list that follows the Figure.
   Comments in the message details are shown in the following form:

      /* Comments. */

1.3.  SIP Protocol Assumptions

   This document does not prescribe the flows precisely as they are
   shown, but rather the flows illustrate the principles for best
   practice.  They are best practices usages (orderings, syntax,
   selection of features for the purpose, handling of error) of SIP
   methods, headers and parameters.  IMPORTANT: The exact flows here
   must not be copied as is by an implementer due to specific incorrect
   characteristics that were introduced into the document for
   convenience and are listed below.  To sum up, the SIP/PSTN call flows
   represent well-reviewed examples of SIP usage, which are best common
   practice according to IETF consensus.

   For simplicity in reading and editing the document, there are a
   number of differences between some of the examples and actual SIP
   messages.  For example, the SIP Digest responses are not actual MD5
   encodings.  Call-IDs are often repeated, and CSeq counts often begin
   at 1.  Header fields are usually shown in the same order.  Usually
   only the minimum required header field set is shown, others that
   would normally be present, such as Accept, Supported, Allow, etc. are
   not shown.

   Actors:

   Element       Display Name   URI                        IP Address
   -------       ------------   ---                        ----------

   User Agent    Alice          sip:alice@a.example.com    192.0.2.101
   User Agent    Bob            sip:bob@b.example.com      192.0.2.200
   Proxy Server                 sip:ss1.a.example.com      192.0.2.111
   User Agent (Gateway)         sip:gw1.a.example.com      192.0.2.201
   User Agent (Gateway)         sip:gw2.a.example.com      192.0.2.202
   User Agent (Gateway)         sip:gw3.a.example.com      192.0.2.203
   User Agent (Gateway)         sip:ngw1.a.example.com     192.0.2.103
   User Agent (Gateway)         sip:ngw2.a.example.com     192.0.2.102

   Note that NGW 1 and NGW 2 also have device URIs (Contacts) of
   sip:ngw1@a.example.com and sip:ngw2@a.example.com which resolve to
   the Proxy Server sip:ss1.wcom.com using DNS SRV records.

2.  SIP to PSTN Dialing

   In the following scenarios, Alice (sip:alice@a.example.com) is a SIP
   phone or other SIP-enabled device.  Bob is reachable via the PSTN at
   global telephone number +19725552222.  Alice places a call to Bob
   through a Proxy Server, Proxy 1, and a Network Gateway.  In other
   scenarios, Alice places calls to Carol, who is served via a PBX
   (Private Branch Exchange) and is identified by a private extension
   444-3333, or global number +1-918-555-3333.  Note that Alice uses
   his/her global telephone number +1-314-555-1111 in the From header in
   the INVITE messages.  This then gives the Gateway the option of using
   this header to populate the calling party identification field in
   subsequent signaling.  Left open is the issue of how the Gateway can
   determine the accuracy of the telephone number which is necessary
   before passing it as a valid calling party number in the PSTN.

   In these scenarios, Alice is a SIP phone or other SIP-enabled device.
   Alice places a call to Bob in the PSTN or Carol on a PBX through a
   Proxy Server and a Gateway.

   In the failure scenarios, the call does not complete.  In some cases
   however, a media stream is still setup.  This is due to the fact that
   some failures in dialing to the PSTN result in in-band tones (busy,
   reorder tones or announcements - &quot;The number you have dialed has
   changed.  The new number is...&quot;).  The 183 Session Progress response
   containing SDP media information is used to setup this early media
   path so that the caller Alice knows the final disposition of the
   call.

   The media stream is either terminated by the caller after the tone or
   announcement has been heard and understood, or by the Gateway after a
   timer expires.

   In other failure scenarios, a SS7 Release with Cause Code is mapped
   to a SIP response.  In these scenarios, the early media path is not
   used, but the actual failure code is conveyed to the caller by the
   SIP User Agent Client.

   Alice dials the globalized E.164 number +19725552222 to reach Bob.
   Note that A might have only dialed the last 7 digits, or some other
   dialing plan.  It is assumed that the SIP User Agent Client converts
   the digits into a global number and puts them into a SIP URI.  Note
   that tel URIs could be used instead of SIP URIs.

   Alice could use either their SIP address (sip:alice@a.example.com) or
   SIP telephone number (sip:+13145551111@ss1.a.example.com;user=phone)
   in the From header.  In this example, the telephone number is
   included, and it is shown as being passed as calling party
   identification through the Network Gateway (NGW 1) to Bob (F5).  Note

   that for this number to be passed into the SS7 network, it would have
   to be somehow verified for accuracy.

   In this scenario, Bob answers the call, then Alice disconnects the
   call.  Signaling between NGW 1 and Bob&#x27;s telephone switch is ANSI
   ISUP.  For the details of SIP to ISUP mapping, refer to [4].

   In this flow, notice that the Contact returned by NGW 1 in messages
   F7-11 is sip:ngw1@a.example.com.  This is because NGW 1 only accepts
   SIP messages that come through Proxy 1 - any direct signaling will be
   ignored.  Since this Contact URI may be used outside of this dialog
   and must be routable (Section 8.1.1.8 in RFC 3261 [2]) the Contact
   URI for NGW 1 must resolve to Proxy 1.  This Contact URI resolves via
   DNS to Proxy 1 (sip:ss1.a.example.com) which then resolves it to
   sip:ngw1.a.example.com which is the address of NGW 1.

   This flow shows TCP transport.

   Alice is a SIP device while Carol is connected via a Gateway (GW 1)
   to a PBX.  The PBX connection is via a ISDN trunk group.  Alice dials
   Carol&#x27;s telephone number (918-555-3333) which is globalized and put
   into a SIP URI.

   The host portion of the Request-URI in the INVITE F3 is used to
   identify the context (customer, trunk group, or line) in which the
   private number 444-3333 is valid.  Otherwise, this INVITE message
   could get forwarded by GW 1 and the context of the digits could
   become lost and the call unroutable.

   Proxy 1 looks up the telephone number and locates the gateway that
   serves Carol.  Carol is identified by its extension (444-3333) in the
   Request-URI sent to GW 1.

   Note that the Contact URI for GW 1, as used in messages F8, F9, F12,
   and F13, is sips:4443333@gw1.a.example.com, which resolves directly
   to the gateway.

   This flow shows the use of Secure SIP (sips) URIs.

   Alice calls Bob through Proxy 1.  Proxy 1 tries to route to a Network
   Gateway NGW 1.  NGW 1 is not available and responds with a 503
   Service Unavailable (F4).  The call is then routed to Network Gateway
   NGW 2.  Bob answers the call.  The call is terminated when Alice
   disconnects the call.  NGW 2 and Bob&#x27;s telephone switch use ANSI ISUP
   signaling.

   NGW 2 also only accepts SIP messages that come through Proxy 1, so
   the Contact URI sip:ngw2@a.example.com is used in this flow.

   This flow shows UDP transport.

   In this scenario, Alice places a call to Bob by dialing Bob&#x27;s
   telephone number (9725552222).  Alice&#x27;s UA converts the phone number
   to an E.164 number (+19725552222), and performs an ENUM query [9] on
   the E.164 number (2.2.2.2.5.5.5.2.7.9.1.e164.arpa), which returns a
   NAPTR record containing a SIP AOR URI for Bob
   (sip:+19725552222@b.example.com).  As a result, Alice&#x27;s UA sends an
   INVITE and the call completes over IP bypassing the PSTN.

   The call is terminated when Bob sends a BYE message.

   Alice calls Bob in the PSTN through a proxy server Proxy 1 and a
   Network Gateway NGW 1.  The call is rejected by the PSTN with an
   in-band treatment (tone or recording) played.  Alice hears the
   treatment and then hangs up, which results in a CANCEL (F9) being
   sent to terminate the call.  (A BYE is not sent since no final
   response was ever received by Alice.)

   Alice calls PSTN Bob through a Proxy Server Proxy 1 and a Network
   Gateway NGW 1.  The call is rejected by the PSTN with a ANSI ISUP
   Release message REL containing a specific Cause code.  This cause
   value (1) is mapped by the Gateway to a SIP 404 Address Incomplete
   response which is proxied back to Alice.  For more details of ISUP
   cause value to SIP response mapping, refer to [4].

   Alice calls Bob in the PSTN through a proxy server Proxy 1 and
   Network Gateway NGW 1.  The call is released by the Gateway after a
   timer expires due to no ANswer Message (ANM) being received.  The
   Gateway sends an ISUP Release REL message to the PSTN and a 480
   Temporarily Unavailable response to Alice in the SIP network.

3.  PSTN to SIP Dialing

   In these scenarios, Alice is placing calls from the PSTN to Bob in a
   SIP network.  Alice&#x27;s telephone switch signals to a Network Gateway
   (NGW 1) using ANSI ISUP.

   Since the called SIP User Agent does not send in-band signaling
   information, no early media path needs to be established on the IP
   side.  As a result, the 183 Session Progress response is not used.
   However, NGW 1 will establish a one way speech path prior to call
   completion, and generate ringing for the PSTN caller.  Any tones or

   recordings are generated by NGW 1 and played in this speech path.
   When the call completes successfully, NGW 1 bridges the PSTN speech
   path with the IP media path.

   To reduce the number of messages, only a single proxy server is shown
   in these flows, which means that the a.example.com proxy server has
   access to the b.example.com location service.

   In this scenario, Alice from the PSTN calls Bob through a Network
   Gateway NGW1 and Proxy Server Proxy 1.  When Bob answers the call,
   the media path is setup end-to-end.  The call terminates when Alice
   hangs up the call, with Alice&#x27;s telephone switch sending an ISUP
   RELease message that is mapped to a BYE by NGW 1.

   This &quot;fast answer&quot; scenario is similar to 3.1., except that Bob
   immediately accepts the call, sending a 200 OK (F5) without sending a
   180 Ringing response.  The Gateway then sends an Answer Message (ANM)
   without sending an Address Complete Message (ACM).  Note that for
   ETSI and some other ISUP variants, a CONnect message (CON) would be
   sent instead of the ANM.

   In this scenario, Alice dials from PBX A to Bob through GW 1 and
   Proxy 1.  This is an example of a call that appears destined for the
   PSTN but is instead routed to a SIP Client.

   Signaling between PBX A and GW 1 is Feature Group B (FGB) circuit
   associated signaling, in-band Mult-Frequency (MF) outpulsing.  After
   the receipt of the 180 Ringing from Bob, GW 1 generates a ringing
   tone for Alice.

   Bob answers the call by sending a 200 OK.  The call terminates when
   Alice hangs up, causing GW1 to send a BYE.

   The  Gateway can only identify the trunk group that the call came in
   on; it cannot identify the individual line on PBX A that is placing
   the call.  The SIP URI used to identify the caller is shown in these
   flows as sip:551313@gw1.a.example.com.

   Alice attempts to place a call through Gateway GW 1 and Proxy 1,
   which is unable to find any routing for the number.  The call is
   rejected by Proxy 1 with a REL message containing a specific Cause
   value mapped by the gateway based on the SIP error.

   In this scenario, Alice calls Bob through Network Gateway NGW 1 and
   Proxy 1.  The call is routed to Bob by Proxy 1.  The call is rejected
   by Bob who sends a 600 Busy Everywhere response.  The Gateway sends a
   REL message containing a specific Cause value mapped by the gateway
   based on the SIP error.

   Since no interworking is indicated in the IAM (F1), the busy tone is
   generated locally by Alice&#x27;s telephone switch.  In some scenarios,
   the busy signal is generated by the Gateway since interworking is
   indicated.  For more discussion on interworking, refer to [4].

   In this scenario, Alice calls Bob through Network Gateway NGW 1 and
   Proxy 1.  The call is routed to Bob by Proxy 1.  The call is rejected
   by the Bob client.  NGW 1 sets up a two way voice path to Alice and
   plays busy tone.  The caller then disconnects

   NGW 1 plays the busy tone since the IAM (F1) indicates the
   interworking is present.  In scenario 5.2.2., with no interworking,
   the busy indication is carried in the REL Cause value and is
   generated locally instead.

   Again, note that for ETSI or ITU ISUP, a CONnect message would be
   sent instead of the Answer Message.

   Alice calls Bob through NGW 1 and Proxy 1.  Proxy 1 re-sends the
   INVITE after the expiration of SIP timer T1 without receiving any
   response from Bob.  Bob never responds with 180 Ringing or any other
   response (it is reachable but unresponsive).  After the expiration of
   a timer, Alice&#x27;s network disconnects the call by sending a Release
   message REL.  The Gateway maps this to a CANCEL.

   In this scenario, Alice calls Bob through NGW 1 and Proxy 1.  Since
   Proxy 1 is stateless (it does not send a 100 Trying response), NGW 1
   re-sends the INVITE message after the expiration of SIP timer T1.
   Bob does not respond with 180 Ringing.  Alice&#x27;s network disconnects
   the call with a release REL (CauseCode=102 Timeout).

   In this scenario, Alice calls Bob through NGW 1 and Proxy 1.  Bob
   does not respond with 200 OK.  NGW 1 plays ringing tone since the ACM
   indicates that interworking has been encountered.  Alice disconnects
   the call with a Release message REL which is mapped by NGW 1 to a

   CANCEL.  Note that if Bob had sent a 200 OK response after the REL,
   NGW 1 would have sent an ACK and then a BYE to properly terminate the
   call.

4.  PSTN to PSTN Dialing via SIP Network

   In these scenarios, both the caller and the called party are in the
   telephone network, either normal PSTN subscribers or PBX extensions.
   The calls route through two Gateways and at least one SIP Proxy
   Server.  The Proxy Server performs the authentication and location of
   the Gateways.

   Again it is noted that the intent of this call flows document is not
   to provide a detailed parameter level mapping of SIP to PSTN
   protocols.  For information on SIP to ISUP mapping, the reader is
   referred to other references [4].

   In these scenarios, the call is successfully completed between the
   two Gateways, allowing the PSTN or PBX users to communicate.  The 183
   Session Progress response is used to indicate that in-band alerting
   may flow from the called party telephone switch to the caller.

   In this scenario, Alice in the PSTN calls Carol who is an extension
   on a PBX.  Alice&#x27;s telephone switch signals via SS7 to the Network
   Gateway NGW 1, while Carol&#x27;s PBX signals via SS7 with the Gateway GW
   2.  The CdPN and CgPN are mapped by GW 1 into SIP URIs and placed in
   the To and From headers.  Proxy 1 looks up the dialed digits in the
   Request-URI and maps the digits to the PBX extension of Carol, which

   is served by GW 2.  The Proxy in F3 uses the host portion of the
   Request-URI to identify what private dialing plan is being
   referenced.  The INVITE is then forwarded to GW 2 for call
   completion.  An early media path is established end-to-end so that
   Alice can hear the ringing tone generated by PBX C.

   Carol answers the call and the media path is cut through in both
   directions.  Bob hangs up terminating the call.

   PBX Alice calls PBX Carol via Gateway GW 1 and Proxy 1.  During the
   attempt to reach Carol via GW 2, an error is encountered - Proxy 1
   receives a 503 Service Unavailable (F4) response to the forwarded
   INVITE.  This could be due to all circuits being busy, or some other
   outage at GW 2.  Proxy 1 recognizes the error and uses an alternative
   route via GW 3 to terminate the call.  From there, the call proceeds
   normally with Carol answering the call.  The call is terminated when
   Carol hangs up.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document provides examples of mapping from SIP to ISUP and ISUP
   to SIP.  The gateways in these examples are compliant with the
   Security Considerations Section of RFC 3398 [4] which is summarized
   here.

   There are few security concerns relating to the mapping of ISUP to
   SIP besides privacy considerations in the calling party number
   passing.  Some concerns relating to the mapping from tel URI
   parameters to ISUP include the user creation of parameters and codes
   relating to called number and local number portability (LNP).  An
   operator of a gateway should use policies similar to those present in
   PSTN switches to avoid security problems.

   The mapping from a SIP response code to an ISUP Cause Code presents a
   theoretical risk, so a gateway operator may implement policies
   controlling this mapping.  Gateways should also not rely on the
   contents of the From header field for identity information, as it may
   be arbitrarily populated by a user.  Instead, some sort of
   cryptographic authentication and authorization should be used for
   identity determination.  These flows show both HTTP Digest for
   authentication of users, although for brevity, the challenge is not
   always shown.

   The early media cut-through shown in some flows is another potential
   security risk, but it is also required for proper interaction with
   the PSTN.  Again, a gateway operator should use proper policies
   relating to early media to prevent fraud and misuse.  Finally, a user
   agent (even a properly authenticated one) can launch multiple
   simultaneous requests through a gateway, constituting a denial of
   service attack.  The adoption of policies to limit the number of
   simultaneous requests from a single entity may be used to prevent
   this attack.

   As discussed in the SIP-T framework [7], SIP/ISUP interworking can be
   employed as an interdomain signaling mechanism that may be subject to
   pre-existing trust relationships between administrative domains.  Any
   administrative domain implementing SIP-T or SIP/ISUP interworking
   should have an adequate security apparatus (including elements that
   manage any appropriate policies to manage fraud and billing in an
   interdomain environment) in place to ensure that the translation of
   ISUP information does not result in any security violations.

   Although no examples of this are shown in this document, transporting
   ISUP in SIP bodies may provide opportunities for abuse, fraud, and
   privacy concerns, especially when SIP-T requests can be generated,
   inspected or modified by arbitrary SIP endpoints.  ISUP MIME bodies
   should be secured (preferably with S/MIME as detailed in RFC 3261
   [2]) to alleviate this concern.  Authentication properties provided
   by S/MIME would allow the recipient of a SIP-T message to ensure that
   the ISUP MIME body was generated by an authorized entity.  Encryption
   would ensure that only carriers possessing a particular decryption
   key are capable of inspecting encapsulated ISUP MIME bodies in a SIP
   request.
