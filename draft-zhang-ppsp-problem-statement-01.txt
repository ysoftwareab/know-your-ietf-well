1. Overview 

   Peer to Peer video streaming applications have been successfully 
   dominating Internet traffic in recent times. According to statistics 
   in a main china ISP in 2008, PPLive accounts 10% of the total 
   Internet backbone traffic. In contrast, Bittorrent, one of the most 
   popular p2p file downloading software, contributes to less than 8% of 
   the backbone traffic.  

   Some big vendors, PPLive[1], PPstream[2], UUSee[3] and Pando[4] etc. 
   show the popularity of P2P streaming applications. Take PPLive for 
   example, it has over 2 million online users at the same time to watch 
   live programs such as CCTV spring festival gala.  

   P2P video streaming technology has become an important part of the 
   Internet.

2. Incentive of an open P2P streaming Protocol 

   Basically there are two architectures for video streaming: client-
   server streaming paradigm and P2P streaming paradigm. Client-server 
   streaming paradigm has been well studied which can be depicted by the 
   following figure 1. 

                   +----------------------------------+ 
                   |   Streaming Application          | 
                   |----------------------------------| 
                   |      RTSP/MMS/PNA/HTTP           | 
                   |-----------------+----------------| 
                   |      RTP        |       RTCP     | 
                   |-----------------+----------------| 
                   |             UDP/TCP              |

                   |          IP Protocol             | 
                   +----------------------------------+ 
                                      
                  Figure 1 Client/server Streaming Stack 

   Basically client-server streaming comprises of two parts of protocols: 
   transport protocol and signaling protocol. Transport protocol is used 
   for viedo payload transmission between the client and the server. 
   Signaling protocol is used to negotiate streaming controls between 
   the client and the server. RTP and RTCP,are designed for streaming 
   transmission.RTSP[7], MMS[8],PNA[9] and HTTP are used as streaming 
   signaling protocols. However its scalability, reliability and 
   availability faces with serious problems with a large number of 
   audience simultaneously viewing the programs.  

   P2P technology provides a good candidate for streaming applications 
   to solve such problems. It partitions streaming source into pieces 
   which are distributed over peers when the audience views the programs. 
   Therefore peers need to locate and receive the stream chunks from 
   multiple sources simultaneously, which eliminates single point of 
   failure. The biggest problem is therefore how to make sure real-time 
   data retrieval and transmission that can keep up with the source 
   broadcasting. To the best of our understanding, current p2p streaming 
   protocols have common underlying design principles. According to our 
   measurement work[11], existing p2p streaming systems like pplive, 
   ppstream and uusee deploy a similar architecture and signaling 
   transaction process. Therefore it's possible to develop an open p2p 
   streaming protocol to integrate existing p2p streaming protocols.  

   However, almost all of the existing p2p streaming software use their 
   proprietary protocols, esp. in the signaling part. Proprietary

   protocols protect the service providers from easily copied. These 
   protocols are not interoperability with each another and pose a 
   barrier of entry for other p2p streaming providers. On the other 
   hand,it also increases the cost for outsiders to improve such systems 
   or develop a new p2p streaming system or video accelerator system 
   (transition from traditional cache or CDN)from scratch without an 
   open p2p streaming protocol. Moreover, this makes it hard for anyone 
   outside a P2P streaming service to interact with it including 

   1) ISPs for traffic management and optimization; 

   2) Other streaming services for content/user sharing; 

   3) Hardware vendors for set-top box or mobile terminals supporting 
      p2p streaming 

    and vice versa. The only means to learn such systems is Internet 
   measurement. People can know how a p2p streaming system works by 
   analyzing such p2p streaming systems by either active or passive 
   measurement. Unfortunately some of p2p streaming systems have been 
   encrypted or scrambled due to content pollution protection. Once the 
   system is encrypted, the last means is of no use.  

   What's more, an open p2p streaming protocol has more benefit under 
   the following scenarios. 

   1) Better Performance with inter-worked p2p streaming systems: 
   According to the measurement study of comparison on pplive and 
   ppstream protocols [11], their peer lists don't overlap and can be 
   complementary to each other at a certain time. In PPlive the chunk 
   fetch policy is both sequential fetching and rarest first at same 
   time while in ppstream the chunk fetch is random selection in each 
   buffer window. We can see it clearly in figure2. Suppose pplive and 
   ppstream are transmitting the same programs piece#1, in a certain 
   time round1,peer1 in ppstream may fetch chunk#3 and #5 and update its 
   bitmap with [00101] according to random chunk selection. If peer2 
   is the new comer to request program piece#1 in ppstream, he asks the 
   tracker to get peer1 information. However peer1 doesn't contain 
   chunk#1 and chunk#2 information. So peer2 has to wait for other peers 
   holding chunk#1 and chunk#2, which causes more latency before viewing 
   the program. If there is an open p2p streaming protocol, pplive and 
   ppstream can inter-work and exchange peer information, things are 
   quite different. In time round1,peer3 in pplive may fetch chunk#1 and 
   chunk#2 according to its chunck fetch policy. If this information can 
   be used by ppstream users, peer2 may fetch chunk#1 and #2 from peer3 
   to save the caching time.

   2) Wider coverage of streaming services: There is usually serious 
   competition among P2P streaming providers for similar program source 
   in the same country while P2P streaming providers in different 
   countries may cooperate to share program information to broaden its 
   audience. An open p2p streaming protocol helps different P2P 
   streaming providers to share both programs and user resources. 

   3) Integration of current caches, CDNs and video-sharing websites by 
   a uniform p2p streaming protocol. There are lots of web caches and 
   CDNs in current Internet. However most of them don't support 
   streaming services, let alone p2p streaming. In the winter of finance 
   crisis which is being widespread all over the world, p2p streaming 
   technologies are regarded a good tool to accelerate the download rate 
   and reduce the transmission cost for the video websites like 
   youtube[5]and tudou [6]. Some traditional CDNs are trying to add p2p 
   mechanisms to support video acceleration[10].If a uniform p2p 
   streaming protocol is developed, traditional caches and CDN nodes can 
   easily deploy p2p technology based on current platform. This will be 
   a great save in transmission cost. 

   4) Providing mobile and wireless streaming: Mobility becomes a very 
   important feather to support in future internet. Many next generation 
   Internet studies investigate to introduce distributed mobile services 
   like GENI[12] and FIND[13]. Many operators have also been launching 
   research projects on mobile Internet practice. For example, China 
   Mobile came out with its DSN (distributed services network)strategy 
   last year as the core network of its mobile Internet. Readers can 
   refer to draft-zhang-ppsp-dsn-introduction[14] for more details. 

   However there are some differences in mobile Internet compared to 
   fixed Internet environment. This makes it hard to copy current p2p 
   streaming protocol in mobile and wireless environment.

Internet-Draft   Problem Statement of P2P Streaming Protocol  March 2009 
    

   a) End to end communication is harder. Unlike fixed Internet, it's 
      difficult to realize end-to-end communication in mobile Internet. 
      For example, currently mobile phone cannot connect with each other 
      directly. The connection must be set up by wireless access nodes 
      like GGSN. Therefore mobile phone is hard to become a peer in p2p 
      streaming environment without the cooperation of mobile access 
      equipments. 

   b) Limited Bandwidth resource. Every mobile node has a small 
       bandwidth and the transmission cost is relatively high. To make 
       p2p streaming applications available in mobile internet, some 
       mechanisms to reduce bandwidth consumption is necessary such as 
       broadcasting. A practical means may be to distribute streaming 
       data to mobile access nodes using the-state-of-art p2p streaming 
       technologies and the mobile access nodes may broadcast the stream 
       data to end users.  

      The above two problems call for redefining an open p2p streaming 
      protocol by both operators and service providers. 

   c) Worldwide service provision is harder. For instance, suppose China 
      Mobile launches streaming services cooperated with pplive, the 
      users cannot use it in USA if Verizon cooperates with Pando for 
      streaming services. Although the user can connect with pplive 
      tracker, there is no Verizon users listed in the returned peerlist. 
      The mobile access nodes in Verizon may block multiple incoming 
      streams to the user who is not Verizon's streaming subscribers. An 
      open p2p streaming protocol helps China mobile and Verizon to 
      cooperate in caching the data stream or exchanging local peer 
      information. 

   d) Converged service provision needs to repair current protocols. 
      There are two converged scenarios. 

   First, suppose a hybrid mobile/wireless and wired Internet 
   environment, it's possible for wired users (who may have multiple 
   interfaces including wireless interface) and wireless users to 
   cooperate with each other. Different from current p2p streaming 
   protocol, user information such as online time, link condition, node 
   capability or battery information and other useful information must 
   be provided for trackers. Peers may even switch from a strong peer 
   (contributing to others) with WLAN connections and high battery 
   volume to a weak peer(contributing nothing) with CDMA connections and 
   low battery volume. We foresee that peer-to-peer video streaming 
   protocol should take these into account to more efficiently use the 
   available peer information.

Internet-Draft   Problem Statement of P2P Streaming Protocol  March 2009 
    

   If we repair the current proprietary protocols, there are lot of 
   repeated works to do for different streaming vendors. An open p2p 
   streaming protocol seems a better choice. 

   Second, seamless switch between mobile and fixed nodes needs to 
   repair the current protocol. In future internet, users can easily 
   watch p2p streaming with their mobile phones in the way home and once 
   they arrive home, the program can be seamlessly switched to display 
   in TV set. However current p2p streaming protocol doesn't support 
   this without explicit user location information appeared in the 
   tracker.  

   5) End users need only one p2p streaming client to support multiple 
   p2p streaming vendors with an open p2p streaming protocol. This is 
   especially useful for resource-constraint end users devices such as 
   mobile phones or PDAs. 

   To sum up, an open p2p streaming protocol is necessary in future 
   Internet to benefit for each side, including service providers, ISPs, 
   network and terminal equipment vendors, researchers as well as end 
   users. It allows for involving more participants in p2p streaming 
   with better performance and more audience.  

   We'd like to point out that an open protocol won't weaken the 
   independence of current p2p streaming providers. It depends on the 
   vendors' strategy. If they wish to cooperate with each other, it's 
   easy to inter-work; or else it can be easily protected by data 
   encryption or other DRM means.

3. Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol(PPSP) Interactions   

   Peer to Peer Streaming Protocol(PPSP) involves a bundle of 
   interactions. From the measurement research we have done in the 
   draft[11], there are two roles in current tracker-based p2p streaming 
   structure: peer and tracker. PPSP includes interaction between peers, 
   between peers and trackers. In some practice, CDN nodes are added in 
   p2p streaming structure. Note that CDN can be viewed as a special 
   peer who has a complete copy of the programs in VoD and a super-
   stable peer with higher upload and download bandwidth in real-time 
   streaming.  

   We conclude the process of PPSP applications as follows.  

   1) Peer sending request with parameters(e.g., QoS, location, 
   historical records such as online duration). 

   2) Tracker returning Peer list according to the parameters. 

   3) Peer gossiping communication among peer candidates to exchange 
   chunk bitmap and find a chunk. 

   4) Peer scheduling where to get the chunk and do cache replacement
     e.g., BT like, rarest first . This action is done by peer itself 
   and doesn't include interaction with other peers or network. 

   5) Chunk transmission among peers(including CDN transmission):  

   6) Peer Re-assembling the chunk in its cache to finish playback of 
   the programs. 

   7) Peer reporting to Tracker what chunks it has periodically.

4. Problem Statement and Scope of PPSP  

   We propose to develop an open peer to peer streaming protocol, namely 
   PPSP. The basic problem of PPSP is to define a protocol of locating 
   and transmitting real-time and VoD data efficiently from multiple 
   sources with different pieces in peer to peer environment. This is an 
   one to many communication (or data-driven communication).One to many 
   communication is different from one to one communication where there 
   is known destination to visit. In one to many communications, the 
   destinations are unknown and the concrete data are stored piece by 
   piece in different peers and the key is to find those data and 
   reassemble them. 

   PPSP focuses on how to negotiate with un-preassigned peers for needed 
   chunks and transmit the retrieved content accordingly. Therefore, 
   PPSP can be divided into PPSP signaling protocol and transmission 
   protocol. The protocol stack of PPSP is shown in Fig4. Based on our 
   previous work, we leave the transport protocol in the second stage. 
   For the purpose of this document, we focus only on PPSP signaling

   In the signaling part, in order to locate real-time data efficiently 
   from multiple sources with different pieces, we have to solve the 
   following problems: 

   1) To standardize the architecture for locating the data efficiently.  

   Tracker-based structure is widely used in current p2p streaming 
   practice. However some tracker-less structures like DHT peer 
   management solutions are also proposed. We need to decide which one 
   is better for p2p streaming; 

   2) To standardize the signaling interaction process.

   In this part we actually want to standardize client registration 
   process (analogous to TCP 3-way handshake procedure), client 
   information exchange process (analogous to SIP session setup process) 
   and client report process.  

   The current tracker-based means is a two-step searching, i.e., peer 
   reporting to tracker coarse information about it has. Once the 
   tracker is asked, it informs peer of the coarse information; the 
   grain information is achieved by peers exchanging bitmap each other. 
   Some other means, e.g., peer reporting to tracker grain information 
   directly and tracker informs peer of the exact information or DHT 
   based searching, should be evaluated. In each proposal we also need 
   to define the message format in the interactions. 

   2) To discuss how to incorporate node information such as online time, 
   link status, node capability, battery information and some 
   application requirements parameters into the protocol to expand the 
   peer selection. 

   In this part, we actually want to standardize PPSP message headers 
   (analogous to IP header definition) and PPSP metadata format 
   (analogous to SIP header definition). 

   In the future, after we finish developing PPSP signaling protocol, 
   PPSP transport protocol may also be standardized for client data 
   transfer process,e.g., one-to-many transport protocol based on UDP, 
   TCP and RTP. This is beyond current TCP, UDP or RTP scope.

5. Comparison with related protocols  

5.1. P2PSIP 

   P2PSIP deals with resource location in one to one commutation. The 
   iterative and recursive routing process inP2PSIP is shown in Fig5, 
   which is different from PPSP. That is, the data stored in P2P SIP is 
   user profile data and user knows exactly what the data is (e.g., the 
   location of Alice@chinamobile.com) using RELOAD to locates the data. 
   While in PPSP scenarios, there are many peers storing data pieces of 
   ''Mr. and Mrs. Smith'' and the user doesn't know and needn't know the 
   belongings of the peers and he just know the metadata of the movie. 
   He must use a gossip protocol to communicate with other peers to get 
   the real data quickly.

             |                                                | 
             +------------------------------------------------+ 
     
                            Figure 5 P2PSIP process 

   The difference between P2PSIP and PPSP are as follows: 

   1) One to one communication VS one to many communication (End to End 
   communication VS data centric communication).Because there are lot of 
   peer candidates in PPSP, NAT transversal is not as important as that 
   in P2PSIP and public peers can be found with higher probability; 

   2) PPSP includes transmission Protocol and P2PSIP doesn't involve 
   that. 

   3) Different Search efficiency requirements. PPSP requires retrieval 
   real-time/para real-time data, iterative and recursive routing is not 
   suitable for low efficiency. 

   4) Different transmission quality requirements: In PPSP some extra 
   factors in peers must be considered, e.g.,heterogeneous nodes,node

   churn and data churn(the data update quicker than P2PSIP)and 
   topology-aware; 

   5) Different applicable services: P2PSIP is suitable for VoIP and 
   PPSP is suitable for streaming, gaming and file sharing.  

   Although P2PSIP doesn't fit for streaming peer organization, it can 
   be deployed in PPSP environment to some extent. DHT can be used to 
   organize multiple channel servers in real-time streaming or multiple 
   file trackers in VoD. Because the search time of which channel or 
   which file the tracker stores accounts little in the whole searching 
   procedure, DHT can be used to query for peer list in case of thousand 
   of channels or million of files which are hard to use one tracker. 
   But it doesn't fit for quick search for real data among peers yet. 

5.2. RTSP and related protocols 

   At first sight, the function of PPSP control protocol is similar to 
   traditional C/S style streaming control protocols RTSP, MMS or PNA. 
   But in fact RTSP MMS or PNA don't involve the problems PPSP has 
   because the end user requests the streaming from one assigned source 
   without needing real-time resource discovery, merge and 
   synchronization, which simplifies the problem. However it also 
   inherits the shortcomings of all client-server paradigms including 
   low scalability, high cost both for investment and maintenance as 
   well as the traffic pressure for the Internet equipments and single 
   point of failure.

6. Security Considerations  

   PPSP include security mechanisms. Now we are at the beginning stage 
   and security issues need to be further investigated.
