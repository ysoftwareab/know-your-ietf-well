Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism that allows a SIP User Agent
   Client (UAC) to request a SIP URI-list (Uniform Resource Identifier
   list) service to send a SIP MESSAGE request to a set of destinations.
   The client sends a SIP MESSAGE request that includes the payload
   along with the URI-list to the MESSAGE URI-list service, which sends
   a similar MESSAGE request to each of the URIs included in the list.

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


1.  Introduction

   RFC 3261 (SIP) [RFC3261] is extended by RFC 3428 [RFC3428] to carry
   instant messages in MESSAGE requests.  One of the aspects of MESSAGE
   requests according to RFC 3428 [RFC3428] is the lack of support for
   sending the same request to multiple recipients and replying to all
   recipients of a SIP MESSAGE request.  This memo addresses these
   functions.

   A first requirement can be expressed as:

      REQ-1: It MUST be possible for a user to send an instant message
      request to an ad-hoc group, where the identities of the recipients
      are carried in the message itself.

   One possibility to fulfill the above requirement is to establish a
   session of instant messages with an instant messaging conference
   server.  While this option seems to be reasonable in many cases, in
   other situations the sending user just wants to send a small page-
   mode instant message to an ad-hoc group without the burden of setting
   up a session.  This document focuses on sending a page-mode instant
   message to a number of intended recipients.

   To meet the requirement with a page-mode instant message, we allow
   SIP MESSAGE requests carry recipient-list bodies, i.e., URI-lists in
   body parts whose Content-Disposition (RFC 2183) [RFC2183] is
   'recipient-list', as specified in the Framework and Security
   Considerations for SIP URI-List Services
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services].  A SIP MESSAGE URI-list service,
   which is a specialized application service, receives the request and
   sends a similar MESSAGE request to each of the URIs in the list.
   Each of these MESSAGE requests contains a copy of the body included
   in the original MESSAGE request.

   A second requirement addresses the "Reply-to-All" functionality:

      REQ-2: It MUST be possible for the recipient of a group instant
      message to send a message to all other participants that received
      the same group instant message (i.e., Reply-To-All).

   To meet this requirement, we provide a mechanism whereby the MESSAGE
   URI-list service also includes a URI-list in body parts whose
   Content-Disposition (RFC 2183) [RFC2183] is 'recipient-list-history',
   as specified in the Extensible Markup Language (XML) Format Extension
   for Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].  The 'recipient-list-history'
   body is sent along with the instant message payload in each of the
   instant messages sent to the recipients.

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


   The User Agent Client (UAC) that sends a MESSAGE request to a MESSAGE
   URI-list service needs to be configured with the SIP URI of the
   service that provides the functionality.  Discovering and
   provisioning of this URI to the UAC is outside the scope of this
   document.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [RFC2119] and indicate requirement levels for compliant
   implementations.

   MESSAGE URI-list service:  SIP application service that receives a
      MESSAGE request with a URI-list and sends a similar MESSAGE
      request to each URI in the list.  In this context, similar
      indicates that some SIP header fields can change, but the MESSAGE
      URI-list service will not change the instant message payload.
      MESSAGE URI-list services behave effectively as specialised B2BUAs
      (Back-To-Back-User-Agents).  A server providing MESSAGE URI-list
      services can also offer URI-list services for other methods,
      although this functionality is outside the scope of this document.
      In this document we only discuss MESSAGE URI-list services.

   Incoming MESSAGE request:  A SIP MESSAGE request that a UAC creates
      and addresses to a MESSAGE URI-list service.  Besides the regular
      instant message payload, an incoming MESSAGE request contains a
      URI-list.

   Outgoing MESSAGE request:  A SIP MESSAGE request that a MESSAGE URI-
      list service creates and addresses to a UAS (User Agent Server).
      It contains the regular instant message payload.

   Intended recipient:  The intended final recipient of the request to
      be generated by MESSAGE URI-list service.



3.  Overview

   A UAC creates a MESSAGE request that contains a multipart body
   including a list of URIs (intended recipients) and an instant
   message.  The list of URIs is formatted according to the XML Formats
   for Representing Resource List [RFC4826] and extended with the
   attributes defined in the XML Format Extension for Representing Copy
   Control Attributes in Resource Lists



Garcia-Martin & Camarillo  Expires May 16, 2008                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


   [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].  The UAC sends this MESSAGE
   request to the MESSAGE URI-list service.  On reception of this
   incoming MESSAGE request, the MESSAGE URI-list service creates a
   MESSAGE request per intended recipient (listed in the URI-list) and
   copies the instant message payload to each of those MESSAGES.  The
   MESSAGE URI-list service also manipulates the XML resource list
   according to the procedures indicated in the XML Format Extension for
   Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute], and attaches the result to
   each of the MESSAGE requests, along with the instant message payload.
   Then the MESSAGE URI-list service sends each of the created outgoing
   MESSAGE request to the respective receiver.

   The MESSAGE URI-list mechanism allows a sender to specify multiple
   targets for a MESSAGE request by including an XML resource list
   according to the XML Format for Representing Resource Lists [RFC4826]
   in the body of the MESSAGE request extended with the attributes
   defined in the XML Format Extension for Representing Copy Control
   Attributes in Resource Lists [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].
   This resource list, whose Content-Disposition (RFC 2183) [RFC2183] is
   'recipient-list', as specified in the Framework and Security
   Considerations for SIP URI-List Services
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services], includes the URIs of the targets.
   Each target URI may also be marked to indicate in what role the URI-
   list service will place the target (e.g., "to", "cc", or "bcc"), and
   whether the target URI is expected to be anonymized or not, according
   to the procedures described in the XML Format Extension for
   Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].  When the MESSAGE URI-list
   server expands the MESSAGE request to each recipient, it includes
   (along with the instant message payload) a new URI-list (based on the
   received one), whose Content-Disposition (RFC 2183) [RFC2183] is
   'recipient-list-history', as specified in the XML Format Extension
   for Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].  This new URI-list includes
   the list of non-anonymous "to" and "cc" targets, allowing recipients
   to both get knowledge of other recipients and reply to them.


4.  URI-List document

   As described in the Framework and Security Considerations for SIP
   URI-List Services [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services], specifications of
   individual URI-list services, like the MESSAGE URI-list service
   described here, need to specify a default format for 'recipient-list'
   bodies used within the particular service.

   The default format for 'recipient-list' bodies for MESSAGE URI-list



Garcia-Martin & Camarillo  Expires May 16, 2008                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


   services is the XML Formats for Representing Resource Lists [RFC4826]
   extended with the XML Format Extension for Representing Copy Control
   Attributes in Resource Lists [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].
   UACs and MESSAGE URI-list services handling 'recipient-list' bodies
   MUST support both of these formats and MAY support other formats.

   As described in the XML Format Extension for Representing Copy
   Control Attributes in Resource Lists
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute], each URI can be tagged with a
   'copyControl' attribute set to either "to", "cc", or "bcc",
   indicating the role in which the recipient will get the MESSAGE
   request.  Additionally, URIs can be tagged with the 'anonymize'
   attribute to prevent that the MESSAGE URI-list server discloses the
   target URI in a URI-list.

   Additionally, the XML Format Extension for Representing Copy Control
   Attributes in Resource Lists [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute]
   defines a 'recipient-list-history' body that contains the list of
   intended recipients.  The default format for 'recipient-list-history'
   bodies for MESSAGE URI-list services is also the XML Formats for
   Representing Resource Lists [RFC4826] extended with the XML Format
   Extension for Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].  MESSAGE URI-list services
   MUST support both of these formats; UASes MAY support these formats.
   MESSAGE URI-list servers and UASes MAY support other formats.

   Nevertheless, the XML Formats for Representing Resource Lists
   [RFC4826] document provides features, such as hierarchical lists and
   the ability to include entries by reference relative to the XCAP root
   URI, that are not needed by the MESSAGE URI-list service defined in
   this document, which only needs to transfer a flat list of URIs
   between a UA (User Agent) and the MESSAGE URI-list server.


5.  Option-tag

   This document defines the 'recipient-list-message' option-tag for use
   in the Require and Supported SIP header fields.

      This option-tag is used to ensure that a server can process the
      'recipient-list' body used in a MESSAGE request.  It also provides
      a mechanism to discover the capability of the server in responses
      to OPTIONS requests.

   Section 6 provides normative procedures for the usage of this option
   tag.

6.  Procedures at the User Agent Client

   A UAC that wants to create a multiple-recipient MESSAGE request
   creates a MESSAGE request that MUST be formatted according to RFC
   3428 [RFC3428] Section 4.  The UAC populates the Request-URI with the
   SIP or SIPS URI of the MESSAGE URI-list service.  In addition to the
   regular instant message body, the UAC adds a recipient-list body
   whose Content-Disposition type is 'recipient-list', specified in the
   Framework and Security Considerations for SIP URI-list Services
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services].  This body contains a URI-list with
   the recipients of the MESSAGE.  Target URIs in this body MAY also be
   tagged with the 'copyControl' and 'anonymize' attributes specified in
   the XML Format Extension for Representing Copy Control Attributes in
   Resource Lists [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].  The UAC MUST
   also include the 'recipient-list-message' option-tag, defined in
   Section 5, in a Require header field.

   UACs generating MESSAGE request that carry recipient-list bodies, as
   described in previous sections, MUST include this option-tag in a
   Require header field.  UAs that are able to receive and process
   MESSAGEs with a recipient-list body, as described in previous
   sections, SHOULD include this option-tag in a Supported header field
   when responding to OPTIONS requests.

   Multiple-recipient MESSAGE requests contain a multipart body that
   contains the body carrying the list and the actual instant message
   payload.  In some cases, the MESSAGE request can contain bodies other
   than the text and the list bodies (e.g., when the request is
   protected with S/MIME as per RFC 3851 [RFC3851]).

   Typically, the MESSAGE URI-list service will copy all the significant
   header fields in the outgoing MESSAGE request.  However, there might
   be cases where the SIP UA wants the MESSAGE URI-list service to add a
   particular header field with a particular value, even if the header
   field wasn't present in the MESSAGE request sent by the UAC.  In this
   case, the UAC MAY use the "?" mechanism described in Section 19.1.1
   of RFC 3261 [RFC3261] to encode extra information in any URI in the
   list.  However, the UAC MUST NOT use the special "body" hname (see
   Section 19.1.1 of RFC 3261 [RFC3261]) to encode a body, since the
   body is present in the MESSAGE request itself.

   The following is an example of a URI that uses the "?" mechanism:

   sip:bob@example.com?Accept-Contact=*%3bmobility%3d%22mobile%22

   The previous URI requests the MESSAGE URI-list service to add the
   following header field to a MESSAGE request to be sent to
   bob@example.com:

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


   Accept-Contact: *;mobility="mobile"

   The XML Format for Representing Resource Lists [RFC4826] document
   provides features, such as hierarchical lists and the ability to
   include entries by reference relative to the XCAP root URI.  However,
   these features are not needed by the multiple MESSAGE URI-List
   service defined in this document.Therefore, when using the default
   resource list document, UAs SHOULD use flat lists (i.e., no
   hierarchical lists) and SHOULD NOT use <entry-ref> elements.


7.  Procedures at the MESSAGE URI-List Service

   On reception of a MESSAGE request with a URI-list, the MESSAGE URI-
   list service answers to the UAC with a 202 (Accepted) response.

      Note that the status code in the response to the MESSAGE does not
      provide any information about whether or not the MESSAGEs
      generated by the URI-list service were successfully delivered to
      the URIs in the list.  That is, a 202 (Accepted) response means
      that the MESSAGE URI-list service has received the MESSAGE and
      that it will try to send a similar MESSAGE to the URIs in the
      list.  Designing a mechanism to inform a client about the delivery
      status of an instant message is outside the scope of this
      document.

   Since the MESSAGE URI-List service does not use hierarchical lists
   nor lists that include entries by reference to the XCAP root URI, a
   MESSAGE URI-list server receiving a URI-list with more information
   than what has just been described MAY discard all the extra
   information.

7.1.  Determining the intended recipient

   On reception of a MESSAGE request with a URI-list, a MESSAGE URI-list
   service determines the list of intended recipients by inspecting the
   URI-list contained in the body.

   Section 4.1 of the Framework and Security Considerations for SIP URI-
   List Services [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services] discusses cases when
   duplicated URIs are found in a URI-list.  In order to avoid
   duplicated requests, MESSAGE URI-list services MUST take those
   actions specified in Framework and Security Considerations for SIP
   URI-List Services [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services] into account to
   avoid sending duplicated request to the same recipient.

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


7.2.  Creating an outgoing MESSAGE request

   Since the MESSAGE URI-list behaves as a UAC for outgoing MESSAGE
   requests, for each of the intended recipients, the MESSAGE URI-list
   service creates a new MESSAGE request according to the procedures
   described in Section 4 of RFC 3428 [RFC3428].  Additionally, Section
   5.3 of the Framework and Security Considerations for SIP URI-List
   Services [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services] provides additional general
   guidance in creating outgoing requests.  This document also specifies
   the following procedures:

   o  A MESSAGE URI-list service MUST include a From header field whose
      value is the same as the From header field included in the
      incoming MESSAGE request, subject to the privacy requirements (see
      RFC 3323 [RFC3323] and RFC 3325 [RFC3325]) expressed in the
      incoming MESSAGE request.

         Note that this does not apply to the "tag" parameter.

         Failing to copy the From header field of the sender would
         prevent the recipient to get a hint of the sender's identity.
         Note also that this requirement does not intend to contradict
         requirements for additional services running on the same
         physical node.  Specifically, a privacy service (see RFC 3323
         [RFC3323]) can be co-located with the MESSAGE URI-list service,
         in which case, the privacy service has precedence over the
         MESSAGE URI-list service.

   o  A MESSAGE URI-list service SHOULD generate a new To header field
      value set to the intended recipient's URI.  According to the
      procedures of RFC 3261 [RFC3261] Section 8.1.1.1, this value is
      also expected to be equal to the Request-URI of the outgoing
      MESSAGE request.

         The MESSAGE URI-list service behaves as a User Agent Client,
         thus, the To header field should be populated with the
         recipient's URI.

   o  A MESSAGE URI-list service SHOULD create a new Call-ID header
      field value.

         A Call-ID header field might contain addressing information
         that the sender wants to remain private.  Since there is no
         need to keep the same Call-ID on both sides of the MESSAGE URI-
         list service, and since the MESSAGE URI-list service behaves as
         a User Agent Client, it is recommended to create a new Call-ID
         header field value according to the regular SIP procedures.

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


   o  If a P-Asserted-Identity header field was present in the incoming
      MESSAGE request and the request was received from a trusted
      source, as specified in RFC 3325 [RFC3325], and the first hop of
      the outgoing MESSAGE request is also trusted, a MESSAGE URI-list
      service MUST include a P-Asserted-Identity header field in the
      outgoing MESSAGE request with the same received value.  However,
      if the first hop of the outgoing MESSAGE request is not trusted
      and the incoming MESSAGE request included a Privacy header field
      with a value different than 'none', the MESSAGE URI-list service
      MUST NOT include a P-Asserted-Identity header field in the
      outgoing MESSAGE request.
   o  If a MESSAGE URI-list service is able to assert the identity of a
      user (e.g., using HTTP Digest authentication scheme as per RFC
      2617 [RFC2617], S/MIME as per RFC 3851 [RFC3851], etc.) and the
      service implements a mechanism where it can map that
      authentication scheme to a user's SIP or SIPS URI, and subject to
      the privacy requirements expressed in the incoming MESSAGE request
      (see RFC 3323 [RFC3323], the MESSAGE URI-list MAY insert a
      P-Asserted-Identity header with the value of the user's asserted
      URI.
   o  If the incoming MESSAGE request contains an Authorization or
      Proxy-Authorization header fields whose realm is set to the
      MESSAGE URI-list server's realm, then the MESSAGE URI-list service
      SHOULD NOT copy it to the outgoing MESSAGE request; otherwise
      (i.e., if the Authorization or Proxy-Authorization header field of
      incoming MESSAGE request contains a different realm), the MESSAGE
      URI-list service MUST copy the value to the respective header
      field of the outgoing MESSAGE request.
   o  A MESSAGE URI-list service SHOULD create a separate count for the
      CSeq header field of the outgoing MESSAGE request.
   o  A MESSAGE URI-list service SHOULD initialize the value of the Max-
      Forward header field of the outgoing MESSAGE request.
   o  A MESSAGE URI-list service MUST include its own value in the Via
      header field.

7.3.  Composing bodies in the outgoing MESSAGE request

   When creating the body of each of the outgoing MESSAGE requests, the
   MESSAGE URI-list service tries to keep the relevant bodies of the
   incoming MESSAGE request and copies them to the outgoing MESSAGE
   request.  The following guidelines are provided:

   o  A MESSAGE request received at a MESSAGE URI-list service can
      contain one or more security bodies (e.g., S/MIME, RFC 3851
      [RFC3851]) encrypted with the public key of the MESSAGE URI-list
      service.  These bodies are deemed to be read by the URI-list
      service rather than the recipient of the outgoing MESSAGE request
      (which will not be able to decrypt them).  Therefore, a MESSAGE

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


      URI-list service MUST NOT copy any security body (such as an
      S/MIME as per RFC 3851 [RFC3851] encrypted body) addressed to the
      MESSAGE URI-list service to the outgoing MESSAGE request.  This
      includes bodies encrypted with the public key of the URI-list
      service.
   o  The incoming MESSAGE request typically contains a recipient-list
      body or reference, as indicated in the Framework and Security
      Considerations for SIP URI-List Services
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services] with the actual list of
      recipients.  If this URI-list includes resources tagged with the
      'copyControl' attribute set to a value of "to" or "cc", the URI-
      list service SHOULD include a URI-list in each of the outgoing
      MESSAGE requests.  This list SHOULD be formatted according to the
      XML Format for Representing Resource Lists [RFC4826] and the
      copyControl extension specified in the XML Format Extension for
      Representing Copy Control Attributes in Resource Lists
      [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute].  The URI-list service MUST
      follow the procedures specified in XML Format for Representing
      Resource Lists [I-D.ietf-sipping-capacity-attribute] with respect
      handling of the 'anonymize', 'count' and 'copyControl' attributes.
   o  If the MESSAGE URI-list service includes a URI-list in an outgoing
      MESSAGE request, it MUST include a Content-Disposition header
      field as per RFC 2183 [RFC2183] with the value set to 'recipient-
      list-history' and a 'handling' parameter as per RFC 3204 [RFC3204]
      set to "optional".
   o  If a MESSAGE URI-list service includes a URI-list in an outgoing
      MESSAGE request, it SHOULD use S/MIME (RFC 3851) [RFC3851] to
      encrypt the URI-list with the public key of the receiver.
   o  The MESSAGE URI-list service SHOULD copy all the remaining message
      bodies (e.g., text messages, images, etc.) of the incoming MESSAGE
      request to the outgoing MESSAGE request.
   o  If there is only one body left, the MESSAGE URI-list service MUST
      remove the multipart/mixed wrapper in the outgoing MESSAGE
      request.

   The rest of the MESSAGE request corresponding to a given URI in the
   URI-list MUST be created following the rules in Section 19.1.5
   "Forming Requests from a URI" of RFC 3261 [RFC3261].  In particular,
   Section 19.1.5 of RFC 3261 [RFC3261] states:

      "An implementation SHOULD treat the presence of any headers or
      body parts in the URI as a desire to include them in the message,
      and choose to honor the request on a per-component basis."

   SIP allows to append a "method" parameter to a URI.  Therefore, it is
   legitimate that an the 'uri' attribute of the <entry> element in the
   XML resource list contains a 'method' parameter.  MESSAGE URI-list
   services MUST generate only MESSAGE requests, regardless of the

   'method' parameter that the URIs in the list indicate.  Effectively,
   MESSAGE URI-list services MUST ignore the 'method' parameter in each
   of the URIs present in the URI-list.


8.  Procedures at the UAS

   A UAS (in this specification, also known as intended recipient UAS)
   that receives a MESSAGE request from the URI-list service behaves as
   specified in RFC 3428 [RFC3428] Section 7.

   If the UAS supports this specification and the MESSAGE request
   contains a body with a Content-Disposition header field as per RFC
   2183 [RFC2183] set to 'recipient-list-history', then the UAS will be
   able to determine who are the other intended recipients of the
   MESSAGE request.  This allows the user to create a reply request
   (e.g., MESSAGE, INVITE) to the sender and the rest of the recipients
   included in the URI-list.


9.  Examples

   Figure 1 shows an example of operation.  A SIP UAC issuer sends a
   MESSAGE request.  The MESSAGE URI-list service answers with a 202
   (Accepted) response and sends a MESSAGE request to each of the
   intended recipients.

10.  Security Considerations

   The Framework and Security Considerations for SIP URI-List Services
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services] discusses issues related to SIP URI-
   list services.  Implementations of MESSAGE URI-list services MUST
   follow the security-related rules in the Framework and Security

Internet-Draft   SIP Multiple-Recipient MESSAGE Requests   November 2007


   Considerations for SIP URI-List Services
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-uri-services].  These rules include mandatory
   authentication and authorization of clients, and opt-in lists.

   If the contents of the instant message needs to be kept private, the
   user agent client SHOULD use S/MIME as per RFC 3851 [RFC3851] to
   prevent a third party from viewing this information.  In this case,
   the user agent client SHOULD encrypt the instant message body with a
   content encryption key.  Then, for each receiver in the list, the UAC
   SHOULD encrypt the content encryption key with the public key of the
   receiver, and attach it to the MESSAGE request.


11.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the SIP option tag 'recipient-list-message'

   The following row shall be added to the "Option Tags" section of the
   SIP Parameter Registry:

   +------------------------+------------------------------+-----------+
   | Name                   | Description                  | Reference |
   +------------------------+------------------------------+-----------+
   | recipient-list-message | The body contains a list of  | [RFCXXXX] |
   |                        | URIs that indicates the      |           |
   |                        | recipients of the SIP        |           |
   |                        | MESSAGE request              |           |

   number of this specification.
