1. Abstract

   This draft describes the use of RSVP [RFC2205] with applications
   that do not have resource requirements that may not be readily
   quantifiable (qualitative applications). We introduce the
   æqualitativeÆ service-type. This service-type can be used in
   conjunction with RSVP signaling to manage the allocation of network
   resources to traffic originating from qualitative applications. This
   mode of RSVP usage is particularly applicable to networks that
   combine differentiated service (diff-serv) QoS mechanisms with RSVP
   signaling [intdiff].

2. Motivation

   Using standard RSVP/Intserv signaling, applications running on hosts
   issue requests for network resources by communicating the following
   information to network devices:

   1. A requested service level (Guaranteed or Controlled Load).
   2. The quantity of resources required at that service level.

Moore                                                                1

                      draft-moore-qualsvc-00.txt        February, 1999


   3. Classification information by which the network can recognize
      specific traffic (filterspec).
   4. Policy/identity information indicating the user and/or the app
      for which resources are required.

   In response, standard RSVP aware network nodes choose to admit or
   deny a resource request. The decision is based on the availability
   of resources along the relevant path and on policies. Policies
   define the resources that may be granted to specific users and/or
   applications. When a resource request is admitted, network nodes
   install classifiers that are used to recognize the admitted traffic
   and policers that are used to assure that the traffic remains within
   the limits of the resources requested.

   Standard RSVP/Intserv is not suitable for qualitative applications
   because these applications are unable to quantify the resources they
   require from the network. Since the required resources cannot be
   quantified, network nodes cannot determine whether sufficient
   resources exist to accommodate an applicationÆs traffic and standard
   Intserv style admission control cannot be applied.

   Diff-serv QoS mechanisms are better suited for qualitative
   applications. Nodes in a diff-serv network are typically provisioned
   to classify arriving packets to some small number of behaviour
   aggregates (BAs) [diffarch], and to treat them accordingly. This
   provisioning tends to be æopen-loopÆ in the sense that there is no
   signaling between hosts and the network. Instead, the network
   administrator uses a combination of heuristics, measurement and
   experience to provision the network devices, with no deterministic
   knowledge of the volume of traffic that will arrive at any specific
   node.

   In applying diff-serv mechanisms to manage qualitative traffic,
   network administrators are faced with two challenges:

   1. Provisioning û network administrators need to anticipate the
      volume of traffic likely to arrive at each network node for each
      diff-serv BA. If the volume of traffic arriving is likely to
      exceed the capacity available for the BA claimed, the network
      administrator has the choice of increasing the capacity for the
      BA, reducing the volume of traffic claiming the BA, or
      compromising service to all traffic arriving for the BA.
   2. Classification û diff-serv nodes classify traffic to user and/or
      application, based on the diff-serv codepoint (DSCP) in each
      packetÆs IP header or based on other fields in the packetÆs IP
      header (source/destination address/port and protocol). The latter
      method of classification is referred to as MF classification.
      This method of classification may be unreliable and imposes a
      management burden.

   By using RSVP signaling, the management of traffic from qualitative
   applications in diff-serv networks can be significantly facilitated.
   (Note that RSVP/diff-serv interoperability has been discussed

Moore                                                                2

   previously in the context of quantitative applications and
   quantitative diff-serv services [intdiff]. This draft focuses on
   qualitative applications.)

3. Operational Overview

   In the proposed mechanism, the RSVP sender advertises the new
   service type, æService Type Qualitative' in the ADSPEC that is
   included with the PATH message. No SENDER_TSPEC object is included
   in the PATH message. The RSVP sender also includes with the PATH
   message policy objects identifying the user, application and sub
   application ID [identity, application].

   Network nodes receiving these PATH messages interpret the service
   type to indicate that the traffic flow is not quantifiable. Instead
   of applying quantitative admission control, network nodes manage the
   traffic flow based on the requesting user, the requesting
   application and the type of application sub-flow.

   This mechanism offers significant advantage over a pure diff-serv
   network. It informs each network node which would be affected by the
   traffic flow (and which is interested in intercepting the signaling)
   of:

   1. The demand for resources in terms of number of flows of a
      particular type traversing the node.
   2. The binding between classification information and user,
      application and sub-application.

   This information is particularly useful to policy enforcement points
   and policy decision points (PEPs and PDPs).

   The network is expected to return an RSVP RESV message to the
   sender. The returned RESV message may include a DCLASS object
   [dclass]. The DCLASS object instructs the sender to mark packets on
   the corresponding flow with a specific DSCP. This mechanism allows
   PEP/PDPs to affect the volume of traffic arriving at a node for any
   given BA. It enables the PEP/PDP to do so based on sophisticated
   policies.

3.1 Operational Notes

3.1.1 Scalability Issues

   In any network in which per-flow signaling is used, it is wise to
   consider scalability concerns. Signaling for qualitative
   applications (in addition to quantitative applications) will
   increase the amount of signaling traffic in the network. However,
   since RSVP signaling does not, in general, generate a significant
   amount of traffic relative to the actual data traffic associated
   with the session.



Moore                                                                3

                      draft-moore-qualsvc-00.txt        February, 1999


   Perhaps of more concern is the impact on processing resources at
   network nodes that process the signaling messages. When considering
   this issue, it's important to point out that it is not necessary to
   process the signaling messages at each network node. In fact, the
   combination of RSVP signaling with diff-serv networks may afford
   significant benefits even when the RSVP messages are processed only
   at certain key nodes (such as boundaries between network domains,
   first-hop routers, PEPs or any subset of these). Individual nodes
   should be enabled or disabled for RSVP processing at the discretion
   of the network administrator. See [intdiff] for a discussion of the
   impact of RSVP signaling on diff-serv networks.

   In any case, per-flow state is not necessarily required, even in
   nodes that apply per-flow processing.

3.1.2 Policy Enforcement in Legacy Networks

   Network nodes that adhere to the RSVP spec will transparently pass
   the signaling messages associated with qualitative applications. As
   such, it is possible to introduce a small number of PEPs that are
   enabled for Service Type Qualitative into a legacy network and to
   realize the benefits described in this draft.

3.1.3 Quantitative Applications which Accept Qualitative Service

   This draft does not preclude applications from offering both a
   quantitative service type and Service Type Qualitative, at the same
   time. An example of such an application would be a telephony
   application that benefits from a quantitative service but is able to
   adapt to a qualitative service. By advertising its support for both,
   the application enables network policy to decide which service type
   to provide.

4. Signaling Details

4.1 ADSPEC Generation

   The RSVP sender constructs an initial RSVP ADSPEC object specifying
   Service Type Qualitative. Since there are no service specific
   parameters associated with this service type, the associated ADSPEC
   fragment is empty and contains only the header word. Network nodes
   may or may not supply valid values for bandwidth and latency general
   parameters. As such, they may use the unknown values defined in
   [RFC2216].

   The ADSPEC is added to the RSVP PATH message created at the sender.

4.2 RSVP SENDER_TSPEC Object

   The RSVP SENDER_TSPEC object should not be included in PATH messages
   advertising Service Type Qualitative as the only service type
   supported.

4.3 RSVP FLOWSPEC Object

   Receivers may respond to PATH messages by generating an RSVP RESV
   message including a FLOWSPEC object. The FLOWSPEC object should
   specify that it is requesting Service Type Qualitative.

5. Detailed Message Formats

5.1 Standard ADSPEC Format

   A standard RSVP ADSPEC object is described in [RFC2210]. It includes
   a message header and a default general parameters fragment.
   Following the default general parameters fragment are fragments for
   each supported service type.

5.2 ADSPEC for Qualitative Service Type

   The Qualitative Service Type ADSPEC includes the message header and
   the default general parameters fragment, followed by a single
   fragment denoting Service Type Qualitative. The new fragment
   introduced for Service Type Qualitative is formatted as follows:

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |    3 (a)      |x| Reserved    |           0 (b)               |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   a - indicates Service Type Qualitative (3).
   x - is the break-bit.
   b - indicates zero words in addition to the header.

   A complete ADSPEC supporting only Service Type Qualitative is
   illustrated below:

   Words 2-10: Default general characterization parameters
   (c) - Per-Service header, service number 1  (Default General
   Parameters)
   (x) - Global Break bit (NON_IS_HOP general parameter 2)

   (e) - Parameter ID, parameter 4 (NUMBER_OF_IS_HOPS general
   parameter)

   (r) - Length (0) of per-service data not including header word.

   Note that the standard rules for parsing ADSPEC service fragments
   ensure that the ADSPEC will not be rejected by legacy network
   elements. Specifically, these rules state that a network element
   encountering a per-service data header which it does not understand
   should set bit 23 (the break-bit) to indicate that the service is
   not supported and should use the length field from the header to
   skip over the rest of the fragment.

   Also note that it is likely that it will not be possible for hosts
   or network nodes to generate meaningful values for words 5 and/or 7
   (bandwidth estimates and path latency), due to the qualitative
   nature of the service. In this case, the unknown values from
   [RFC2216] should be used.

5.3 FLOWSPEC Object Format

   The format of an RSVP FLOWSPEC object originating at a receiver
   requesting Qualitative service is shown below. The value of 3 in the
   per-service header (field (c), below) indicates that Service Type
   Qualitative is being requested.

     31            24 23           16 15            8 7

   + +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   2 | 3 (c)         |0|  reserved   |         0 (d)                 |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

    (a) - Message format version number (0)
    (b) - Overall length 1 word not including header)
    (c) - Service header, service number 3 (Qualitative)
    (d) - Length of qualitative data, 0 words not including per-service
   header

5.4 DCLASS Object Format

   DCLASS objects may be included in RESV messages. For details
   regarding the DCLASS object format, see [dclass].

6. Security Considerations

   The message formatting and usage rules described in this note raise
   no new security issues.
