Abstract

   Users go to great lengths to be notified as quickly as possible that
   they have received new mail.  Most of these methods involve polling
   to check for new messages periodically.  A push method handled by the
   final delivery agent gives users quicker notifications and saves

   server resources.  This document does not specify the notification
   method but it is expected that using existing instant messaging
   infrastructure such as XMPP, or SMS messages will be popular.  This
   draft describes an extension to the Sieve mail filtering language
   that allows users to give specific rules for how and when
   notifications should be sent.

Changes since draft-ietf-sieve-notify-05

   o  Fixed XMPP URI in one example.

   o  Addressed Michael's issue with how timestamp are described.

   o  Renamed "valid_notif_method" to "valid_notify_method".

   o  Added text about truncation of a textual part when it is stored in
      a variable using extract_text.

   o  Changed tagged :method argument to positional argument.

   o  Added text about notification throttling, identifying notification
      source and restricting values of the :from parameter.

   o  Added a requirement on documents describing notification methods
      to list which URI parameters must be ignored.

Changes since draft-ietf-sieve-notify-04

   o  Made notification method required.

   o  Defined "mailto" as a mandatory-to-implement method.

   o  Added normative reference to mailto.

   o  Clarified that :importance may be treated as a transport
      indicator.

   o  Clarified that :importance value can be included in the default
      :message, if one is not specified.

   o  Made the default :message implementation specific.

   o  Renamed the capability name from "notify" to "enotify"

   o  Updated IANA registration.

   o  Moved text about ManageSieve capability to the ManageSieve
      document itself.

   o  Removed reference to IANA registry for options.

   o  Some miscellaneous text cleanup and clarification.

Changes since draft-ietf-sieve-notify-03

   o  Added a warning that "notify" must not be used as a crappy form of
      "redirect".

   o  Added a warning about using "notify" to forward confidential
      information in order to bypass organization's policy.

   o  Fixed syntax of the :options argument - it is a string list, each
      string containing "<attribute>=<value>"

   o  Renamed :priority to :importance

   o  Cleaned up section about requirements on methods.

Changes since draft-ietf-sieve-notify-02

   o  Added :from tagged argument.

   o  Added Extract_text action, which allows to extract content of the
      first text/* part.

   o  Added back the ":options" parameter to the notify action.

   o  Added new section talking about requirements on notification
      method specs.

   o  Added more examples.

Changes since draft-ietf-sieve-notify-00

   o  Updated references, etc.

   o  Added IANA considerations section.

   o  Removed denotify action.

   o  Updated examples to use the variables extension.

   o  Replaced notification method with URI.

   o  Removed text suggesting that this extension can be used to track
      all Sieve actions taken.

   o  Changed priority to be a string.

   o  Added text about URI verification.

   o  Clarified that a notification method is allowed to perform
      adaptation of notification context (e.g. truncation, charset
      conversion, etc.).  These adaptations must be documented in a
      document describing the notification method.

   o  Clarified that notify is compatible with all existing actions.

   o  Removed the :id parameter to the notify action.

   o  Added valid_notif_method test that allows to test if an
      notification method (URI) is supported.

   o  Added a new capability response to ManageSieve that allows to
      report supported notification types.

Internet-Draft       Sieve Extension: Notifications         January 2007


1.  Introduction

   This is an extension to the Sieve language defined by [Sieve] for
   providing instant notifications.  It defines the new action "notify".

   This document does not specify the notification methods.  Examples of
   possible notification methods are email and XMPP.  To allow a
   mechanism for portability of scripts that use notifications,
   implementation of the [MailTo] method is mandatory.  Other available
   methods shall depend upon the implementation and configuration of the
   system.

1.1.  Conventions used in this document

   Conventions for notations are as in [Sieve] section 1.1, including
   the use of [ABNF].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [Kwds].


2.  Capability Identifier

   The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
   document is "enotify".


3.  Notify Action

3.1.  Notify Action Syntax and Semantics

   Usage:  notify [":from" string]
           [":importance" <"1" / "2" / "3">]
           [":options" string-list]
           [":message" string]
           <method: string>

   The Notify action specifies that a notification should be sent to a
   user.  The format of the notification is implementation-defined and
   is also affected by the notification method used (see Section 3.2).
   However, all content specified in the :message parameter SHOULD be
   included.

3.2.  Notify parameter "method"

   The method positional parameter identifies the notification method
   that will be used; it is a URI [URI].  For example, the notification



Melnikov, et al.         Expires August 4, 2007                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft       Sieve Extension: Notifications         January 2007


   method can be an SMS URI [SMS-URI] containing a phone number, or an
   XMPP [XMPP] URI containing an XMPP identifier [XMPP-URI].

   The supported URI values will be site-specific, but support for the
   [MailTo] method is REQUIRED in order to insure interoperability.  If
   a URI schema is specified that the implementation does not support,
   the notification MUST cause an error condition.  Sieve scripts can
   check the supported methods using the "valid_notify_method" test to
   be sure that they only use supported ones, to avoid such error
   conditions.

   If the method parameter contains a supported URI schema, then the URI
   MUST be checked for syntactic validity.  An invalid URI syntax or an
   unsupported URI extension MUST cause an error.  An implementation MAY
   enforce other semantic restrictions on URIs -- for example an SMS URI
   can only contain phone numbers in a particular geographical region --
   and will treat violations of such semantic restrictions as errors.

3.3.  Notify tag ":from"

   A ":from" parameter may be used to specify an author of the
   notification.  The syntax of this parameter's value is method-
   specific.  Implementations SHOULD check the syntax according to the
   notification method specification and generate an error when a
   syntactically invalid ":from" parameter is specified.  In order to
   minimize/prevent forgery of the author value, implementations SHOULD
   impose restrictions on what values can specified in a ":from"
   parameter; it is suggested that values which fail such a validity
   check simply be ignored rather than causing the notify action to
   fail.

3.4.  Notify tag ":importance"

   The :importance tag specifies the importance of the delivery of the
   notification.  The :importance tag is followed by a numeric value
   represented as a string: "1" (high importance), "2" (normal
   importance), and "3" (low importance).  If no importance is given,
   the default value "2" SHOULD be assumed.  A notification method can
   treat the importance value as a transport indicator.  For example, it
   might deliver notifications of high importance quicker than
   notifications of normal or low importance.  Some notification methods
   allow users to specify their state of activity (for example "busy" or
   "away from keyboard").  If the notification method provides this
   information it SHOULD be used to selectively send notifications.  If,
   for example, the user marks herself as "busy", a notification method
   can require that a notification with importance of "3" is not to be
   sent, however the user should be notified of a notification with
   higher importance.

Internet-Draft       Sieve Extension: Notifications         January 2007


   If the notification method allows users to filter messages based upon
   certain parameters in the message, users SHOULD be able to filter
   based upon importance.  If the notification method does not support
   importance, then this parameter MUST be ignored, however an
   implementation MAY include the importance value in the default
   message Section 3.6, if one is not provided.

3.5.  Notify tag ":options"

   The :options tag is used to send additional parameters to the
   notification method.  Interpretation of the parameters is method-
   specific.  This document doesn't specify any such additional
   parameter.

   Each string in the options string list has the following syntax:
   "<optionname>=<value>" [[Alexey 3: Should we say something about
   implementation prefix for implementation specific options?  Something
   like "x-Vendor-zzz".  If we don't say it now, it might be too late to
   say it later.]]

3.6.  Notify tag ":message"

   The :message tag specifies the message data to be included in the
   notification.  The entirety of the string SHOULD be sent but
   implementations MAY shorten the message for technical or aesthetic
   reasons.  If the message parameter is absent, a default
   implementation-specific message is used.  Unless specified otherwise
   by a particular notification mechanism, an implementation default
   containing at least the value of the "From" header field and the
   value of the "Subject" header field is RECOMMENDED.

   In order to construct more complex messages the notify extension can
   be used together with the Sieve variables extension [Variables], as
   shown in the examples below.

         }
     }

3.8.  Requirements on notification methods specifications

   This section describes requirements for documents that define
   specific Sieve notification methods.

   A notification method MAY allow modification of the final
   notification text -- for example, truncating it if it exceeds a
   length limit, or modifying characters that can not be represented in
   the target character set.  Characters in the notification text which
   can't be represented by the notification method SHOULD be replaced
   with a symbol indicating an unknown character.  Allowed modifications
   MUST be documented in the document describing the notification
   method.

   A notification method MAY ignore parameters specified in the Notify
   action.



Melnikov, et al.         Expires August 4, 2007                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft       Sieve Extension: Notifications         January 2007


   A notification method MAY recommend the default message value to be
   used if the :message argument is not specified.

   Notifications SHOULD include timestamps, if the notification method
   allows for their transmission outside of the textual message.
   Implementation methods which can only transmit timestamps in the
   textual message MAY include them in the textual message.

   Notifications SHOULD includes means to identify/track its origin, in
   order to allow a recipient to stop notifications or find out how to
   contact the sender.  This requirement is to help tracking a
   misconfigured or abusive origin of notifications.

   Methods SHOULD NOT include any other extraneous information not
   specified in parameters to the notify action.

   Methods MUST specify which URI parameters (if any) must be ignored
   and which ones must be used in the resulting notification.

   If there are errors sending the notification, the Sieve interpreter
   SHOULD ignore the notification and not retry indefinitely.  The Sieve
   interpreter MAY throttle notifications; if it does, a request to send
   a notification can be silently ignored.  Documents describing
   notification methods SHOULD describe how retries, throttling,
   duplicate suppression (if any), etc. are to be handled by
   implementations.


4.  Extract_text Action

   Usage:  extract_text [MODIFIER] [":first" number]
           <varname: string>

   The Extract_text action stores at most :first bytes of the first
   text/* part in the variable identified by varname.  If the :first
   parameter is not present, the whole content of the first text/* part
   is stored.  In either case the actually stored data MAY be truncated
   to conform to implementation specific limit on variable length and/or
   on MIME body part length.

   If the message being processed doesn't contain any text/* part, the
   action will set the variable identified by varname to the empty
   string.  [[Alexey 5: Do we need to be more specific about what "the
   first text part" means?]]

   Modifiers are applied on the extracted text before it is stored in
   the variable.  See [Variables] for details.

Internet-Draft       Sieve Extension: Notifications         January 2007


   Note that this action is only available when the Sieve script
   specifies both "variables" [Variables] and "enotify" capabilities in
   the require statements.



   Example 4:
       require ["enotify", "variables"];

       if header :contains "from" "boss@example.org" {
           # :matches is used to get the value of the Subject header
           if header :matches "Subject" "*" {
               set "subject" "${1}";
           }

           # extract the first 100 bytes of the first text/* part
           extract_text :first 100 "msgcontent";

           # don't need high importance notification for
           # a 'for your information'
           if not header :contains "subject" "FYI:" {
               notify :importance "1"
                      :message "BOSS: ${subject}; ${msgcontent}"
                                      "sms:+14085551212";
           }
       }



5.  Test valid_notify_method

   Usage:  valid_notify_method <notification-uris: string-list>

   The "valid_notify_method" test is true if the notification methods
   listed in the notification-uris argument are supported and they are
   syntactically and semantically (including implementation-specific
   semantic restrictions) valid.  This test MUST perform exactly the
   same validation as would be performed on the "method" parameter to
   the "notify" action.

   The test is true only if ALL of the listed notification methods are
   supported and valid.



   Example 5:
             if not valid_notify_method ["mailto:",
                     "http://gw.example.net/notify?test"] {

Internet-Draft       Sieve Extension: Notifications         January 2007


                 stop;
             }


6.  Interactions with Other Sieve Actions

   The notify action is compatible with all other actions, and does not
   affect the operation of other actions.  In particular, the notify
   action MUST NOT cancel the implicit keep.

   Multiple executed notify actions are allowed.  Specific notification
   methods MAY allow multiple notifications from the same script to be
   collapsed into one.


7.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in [Sieve].  Additionally,
   implementations must be careful to follow the security considerations
   of the specific notification methods.

   The notify action is potentially very dangerous.  The path the
   notification takes through the network may not be secure.  An error
   in the options string may cause the message to be transmitted to
   someone it was not intended for, or may expose information to
   eavesdroppers.

   Just because a notification is received doesn't mean that it was sent
   by the Sieve implementation.  It might be possible to forge
   notifications with some notification methods.

   An organization may have a policy about the forwarding of classified
   information to unclassified networks.  Unless the policy is also
   enforced in the module responsible for generating (or sending) of
   notifications, users can use the extension defined in this document
   to extract classified information and bypass the policy.

   Notifications can result in loops and bounces.  [[Michael suggested
   to delete this example: In particular, a notification to an email
   address will not contain necessary Received header fields that might
   be otherwise used to prevent mail loops.]]  All notification methods
   must take care to provide mechanisms for avoiding notification loops.


8.  IANA Considerations

   The following template specifies the IANA registration of the notify
   Sieve extension specified in this document:
