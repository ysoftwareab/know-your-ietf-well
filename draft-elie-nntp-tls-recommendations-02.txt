1.  Introduction

   The Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) [RFC3977] has been using
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) [RFC5246] (along with its precursor,
   Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) since at least year 2000.  The use of
   TLS in NNTP was formalized in [RFC4642], providing at the same time
   implementation recommendations.  In order to address the evolving
   threat model on the Internet today, this document provides stronger
   recommendations regarding that use.

   In particular, this document updates [RFC4642] by specifying that
   NNTP implementations and deployments MUST follow the best current
   practices documented in the "Recommendations for Secure Use of TLS
   and DTLS" [RFC7525].  This includes stronger recommendations

1.2.  Author's Note

   Please write the first letter of "Elie" with an acute accent wherever
   possible -- it is U+00C9 ("&#201;" in XML).  The third letter of
   "Stephane" and the penultimate letter of "allee" similarly have an

   "Baeuerle" should be written as an a-umlaut (U+00E4, "&#228;" in
   XML).

2.  Updates/Changes to RFC 4642

   This document updates [RFC4642] in the following aspects:

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD disable TLS-level
      compression (Section 3.3 of [RFC7525]), thus no longer using TLS
      as a means to provide data compression (contrary to Abstract and
      Section 2.2.2 of [RFC4642]).

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments SHOULD prefer strict TLS
      configuration (Section 3.2 of [RFC7525]), that is to say they
      SHOULD use a port dedicated to NNTP over TLS, and begin the TLS
      negotiation immediately upon connection (contrary to a dynamic
      upgrade from unencrypted to TLS-protected traffic via the use of
      the STARTTLS command, as Section 1 of [RFC4642] was encouraging).
      For the same reasons, transposed to NNTP, as those given in

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              December 2016


      Appendix A of [MUA-STS] (whose one of the authors was also one of
      the authors of [RFC4642]), strict TLS is the preferred way of
      using TLS with NNTP.

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments MUST NOT negotiate RC4 cipher
      suites ([RFC7465]) contrary to Section 5 of [RFC4642] that
      REQUIRED them to implement the TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5 cipher
      suite so as to ensure that any two NNTP compliant implementations
      can be configured to interoperate.  This document removes that
      requirement, so that NNTP client and server implementations follow
      the recommendations given in Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 of [RFC7525]
      instead.  The mandatory-to-implement cipher(s) suite(s) depend on
      the TLS protocol version.  For instance, when TLS 1.2 is used, the
      TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite MUST be implemented
      (Section 9 of [RFC5246]).

   o  NNTP implementations and deployments MUST support the Server Name
      Indication (SNI) extension defined in Section 3 of [RFC6066],
      contrary to Section 2.2.2 of [RFC4642] for which it was only a
      SHOULD.  All clients and servers known by multiple names MUST
      support the SNI extension, in conformance with Section 3.6 of
      [RFC7525].

   Appendix A of this document gives detailed changes with regards to
   the wording of [RFC4642].

3.  Recommendations

   The best current practices documented in the "Recommendations for
   Secure Use of TLS and DTLS" [RFC7525] are included here by reference.
   Therefore, NNTP implementations and deployments compliant with this
   document are REQUIRED to also comply with [RFC7525].

   Instead of repeating those recommendations here, this document mostly
   provides supplementary information regarding secure implementation
   and deployment of NNTP technologies.

3.1.  Compression

   NNTP supports the use of the COMPRESS command, defined in Section 2.2
   of [NNTP-COMPRESS], to compress data between an NNTP client and
   server.  Although this NNTP extension might have slightly stronger
   security properties than TLS-level compression [RFC3749] (since NNTP
   compression can be activated after authentication has completed, thus
   reducing the chances that authentication credentials can be leaked
   via for instance a CRIME attack, as described in Section 2.6 of
   [CRIME]), this document neither encourages nor discourages the use of
   the NNTP COMPRESS extension.

3.2.  Protocol Versions and Security Preferences

   NNTP implementations of news servers are encouraged to support
   options to configure the minimal TLS protocol version to accept, and
   which cipher suites, signature algorithms or groups (like elliptic
   curves) to use for incoming connections.  Additional options can
   naturally also be supported.  The goal is to enable administrators of
   news servers to easily and quickly strengthen security, if need be
   (for instance by rejecting cipher suites considered unsafe with
   regards to local policy).

   News clients may also support similar options, either configurable by
   the user or enforced by the news reader.

3.3.  Server Name Indication

   The TLS extension for Server Name Indication (SNI) defined in
   Section 3 of [RFC6066] MUST be implemented by all news clients.  It
   also MUST be implemented by any news server that is known by multiple
   names.  (Otherwise, it is not possible for a server with several
   hostnames to present the correct certificate to the client.)

3.4.  Authenticated Connections

   [RFC4642] already provides recommendations and requirements for
   certificate validation in the context of checking the client or the
   server's identity.

   Wherever possible, it is best to prefer certificate-based
   authentication (along with SASL [RFC4422]), and ensure that:

   o  Clients authenticate servers.

   o  Servers authenticate clients.

   o  Servers authenticate other peer servers.

   This document does not mandate certificate-based authentication,
   although such authentication is strongly preferred.  As mentioned in
   Section 2.2.2 of [RFC4642], the AUTHINFO SASL command (Section 2.4 of
   [RFC4643]) with the EXTERNAL mechanism (Appendix A of [RFC4422]) MAY
   be used to authenticate a client once its TLS credentials have been
   successfully exchanged.

   Given the pervasiveness of eavesdropping [RFC7258], even an encrypted
   but unauthenticated connection might be better than an unencrypted
   connection (this is similar to the "better-than-nothing security"
   approach for IPsec [RFC5386]).  Encrypted but unauthenticated

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              December 2016


   connections include connections negotiated using anonymous
   Diffie-Hellman mechanisms or using self-signed certificates, among
   others.

   Note: when an NNTP server receives a Netnews article, it MAY add a
   <diag-match> (Section 3.1.5 of [RFC5536]), which appears as "!!" in
   the Path header field of that article, to indicate that it verified
   the identity of the client or peer server.  This document encourages
   the construction of such Path header fields, as described in
   Section 3.2.1 of [RFC5537].

3.5.  Human Factors

   It is strongly encouraged that NNTP clients provide ways for end
   users (and that NNTP servers provide ways for administrators) to
   complete the following tasks:

   o  Determine if a given incoming or outgoing connection is encrypted
      using a security layer (either using TLS or an SASL mechanism that
      negotiates a security layer).

   o  Determine the version of TLS used for encryption of a given
      stream.

   o  If authenticated encryption is used, determine how the connection
      was authenticated or verified.

   o  Inspect the certificate offered by an NNTP server.

   o  Determine the cipher suite used to encrypt a connection.

   o  Be warned if the certificate changes for a given server.

   o  When a security layer is not already in place, be warned if a
      given server stops advertising the STARTTLS capability label in
      response to the CAPABILITIES command (Section 2.1 of [RFC4642])
      whereas it advertised the STARTTLS capability label during any
      previous connection within a (possibly configurable) time frame.
      (Otherwise, a human might not see the warning the first time, and
      the warning would disappear immediately after that.)

   o  Be warned if a failure response to the STARTTLS command is
      received from the server whereas the STARTTLS capability label was
      advertised.

   Note that the last two tasks cannot occur when strict TLS is used.

4.  Security Considerations

   Beyond the security considerations already described in [RFC4642] and
   [RFC7525], the author wishes to add the following caveat when not
   using strict TLS.

   NNTP servers need ensure that they are not vulnerable to the STARTTLS
   command injection vulnerability (Section 2.2 of [RFC7457]).  Though
   this command MUST NOT be pipelined, an attacker could pipeline it.
   Therefore, NNTP servers MUST discard any NNTP command received
   between the use of STARTTLS and the end of TLS negotiation.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Detailed Changes to RFC 4642

   This section lists detailed changes this document applies to
   [RFC4642].

A.1.  Related to TLS-level Compression

   The second sentence in the Abstract of [RFC4642] is replaced with the
   following text:

      The primary goal is to provide encryption for single-link
      confidentiality purposes, but data integrity, and (optional)
      certificate-based peer entity authentication are also possible.

   The second sentence of the first paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of
   [RFC4642] is replaced with the following text:

      The STARTTLS command is usually used to initiate session security,
      although it can also be used for client and/or server certificate
      authentication.

A.2.  Related to Strict TLS

   The third and fourth paragraphs in Section 1 of [RFC4642] are
   replaced with the following text:

      TCP port 563 is dedicated to NNTP over TLS, and registered in the
      IANA Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry for
      that usage.  NNTP implementations using TCP port 563 begin the TLS
      negotiation immediately upon connection and then continue with the
      initial steps of an NNTP session.  This use of strict TLS on a
      separate port is the preferred way of using TLS with NNTP.

      If a host wishes to offer separate servers for transit and reading
      clients (Section 3.4.1 of [RFC3977]), TCP port 563 SHOULD be used
      for strict TLS with the reading server, and an unused port of its
      choice different than TCP port 433 SHOULD be used for strict TLS
      with the transit server.  The ports used for strict TLS should be
      clearly communicated to the clients, and specifically that no
      plain-text communication occurs before the TLS session is
      negotiated.

      As some existing implementations negotiate TLS via a dynamic
      upgrade from unencrypted to TLS-protected traffic during an NNTP
      session on well-known TCP ports 119 or 433, this specification
      formalizes the STARTTLS command in use for that purpose.  However,
      as already mentioned above, implementations SHOULD use strict TLS
      on a separate port.

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              December 2016


      Note: a common alternative to protect NNTP exchanges with transit
      servers that do not implement TLS is the use of IPsec with
      encryption [RFC4301].

A.3.  Related to RC4 Cipher Suites

   The third paragraph in Section 5 of [RFC4642] is removed.
   Consequently, NNTP no longer requires to implement any cipher suites,
   other than those prescribed by TLS (Section 9 of [RFC5246]) and
   Sections 4.2 and 4.2.1 of [RFC7525].

A.4.  Related to Server Name Indication

   The last two sentences of the seventh paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of
   [RFC4642] are removed.  Section 3.6 of [RFC7525] apply.

A.5.  Related to Other Obsolete Wording

   The first two sentences of the seventh paragraph in Section 2.2.2 of
   [RFC4642] are removed.  There is no special requirement for NNTP with
   regards to TLS Client Hello messages.  Section 7.4.1.2 and Appendix E
   of [RFC5246] apply.

Appendix B.  Acknowledgments

   This document draws heavily on ideas in [RFC7590] by Peter
   Saint-Andre and Thijs Alkemade; a large portion of this text was
   borrowed from that specification.

   The author would like to thank the following individuals for
   contributing their ideas and support for writing this specification:
   Michael Baeuerle, Stephane Bortzmeyer, Sabahattin Gucukoglu, Richard
   Kettlewell, Jouni Korhonen, David Eric Mandelberg, and Chris Newman.

   Many thanks to the Responsible Area Director, Alexey Melnikov, for
   reviewing and sponsoring this document.

Appendix C.  Document History (to be removed by RFC Editor before
             publication)

C.1.  Changes since -01

   o  Take into account all the remarks sent during IETF Last Call.

   o  Move the part about [RFC4642] from Introduction to a new dedicated
      Section named "Updates/Changes to RFC 4642" so as to make the
      document a bit more structured.

Internet-Draft             Use of TLS in NNTP              December 2016


   o  The warning about lack of STARTTLS is expanded in scope to say
      "during any previous connection within a (possibly configurable)
      time frame" instead of "during the previous connection".

   o  Remove Appendix about export restrictions on crypto.  It is
      useless since RFC 2804.

   o  Add wording about the use of strict TLS for transit.  Mention the
      use of a port other than 433 for strict TLS between two peers, and
      add a note about a possible use of IPsec [RFC4301] for transit.
      Do not only speak about port 563.

   o  Explicitly mention the mandatory-to-implement cipher suite for TLS
      1.2.

   o  Do not keep the paragraph about TLS Client Hello messages and
      Server Name Indication (SNI) in [RFC4642].  Support for SNI
      [RFC6066] is now a MUST, and not a SHOULD.

   o  Reference [RFC7457] for the STARTTLS command injection
      vulnerability.

   o  Add notes to RFC Editor to ask that [MUA-STS] and [NNTP-COMPRESS]
      references be changed to their [RFCxxxx] form, once published, and
      whether [BCP195] should be used instead of [RFC7525].

   o  Move [RFC5246] (TLS) to a normative reference.

   o  Minor other wording improvements.

C.2.  Changes since -00

   o  Clarify in the introduction of Section 3 that NNTP implementations
      compliant with this document are REQUIRED to also comply with
      [RFC7525].

   o  Improve the wording of Section 3.2 to mention that configuration
      is primarily intended for news servers.  Also, be more consistent
      in the options to accept, and include signature algorithms and
      named groups.

Appendix D.  Issue to Address

   o  The paragraphs in Section 5 of [RFC4642] dealing with certificate
      validation should be modernized in favour of RFC 6125.
