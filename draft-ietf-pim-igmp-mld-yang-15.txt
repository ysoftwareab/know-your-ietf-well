Internet-Draft          IGMP & MLD Yang Model                 June 2019


1. Introduction

   YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] is a data definition language that was
   introduced to model the configuration and running state of a device
   managed using network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241]
   or RESTCONF [RFC8040]. YANG is now also being used as a component of
   wider management interfaces, such as command line interfaces (CLIs).

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to
   configure and manage Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) and
   Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) devices. The protocol versions
   include IGMPv1 [RFC1112], IGMPv2 [RFC2236], IGMPv3 [RFC3376], MLDv1
   [RFC2710], and MLDv2 [RFC3810]. The core features of the IGMP and
   MLD protocols are defined as required.  Non-core features are
   defined as optional in the provided data model.

   The YANG model in this document conforms to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

1.1. Terminology

   The terminology for describing YANG data models is found in
   [RFC6020] and [RFC7950], including:

     o augment

     o data model

     o data node

     o identity

     o module

   The following abbreviations are used in this document and the
   defined model:

   IGMP:

      Internet Group Management Protocol [RFC3376].

   MLD:

      Multicast Listener Discovery [RFC3810].

   SSM:

      Source-Specific Multicast service model [RFC3569] [RFC4607].

1.2. Tree Diagrams

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340].

1.3. Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes, actions, and other data model
   objects are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from
   the context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise,
   names are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------------+
   | Prefix    | YANG module              | Reference           |
   +-----------+--------------------------+---------------------+
   | yang      | ietf-yang-types          | [RFC6991]           |
   | inet      | ietf-inet-types          | [RFC6991]           |
   | if        | ietf-interfaces          | [RFC8343]           |
   | ip        | ietf-ip                  | [RFC8344]           |
   | rt        | ietf-routing             | [RFC8349]           |
   | rt-types  | ietf-routing-types       | [RFC8294]           |
   | acl       | ietf-access-control-list | [RFC8519]           |

2. Design of Data model

2.1. Scope of Model

   The model covers IGMPv1 [RFC1112], IGMPv2 [RFC2236], IGMPv3
   [RFC3376], MLDv1 [RFC2710], and MLDv2 [RFC3810].

   This model does not cover other IGMP and MLD related protocols such
   as IGMP/MLD Proxy [RFC4605] or IGMP/MLD Snooping [RFC4541] etc.,
   which will be specified in separate documents.

   This model can be used to configure and manage various versions of
   IGMP and MLD protocols. The operational state data and statistics
   can be retrieved by this model. Even though no protocol specific
   notifications are defined in this model, the subscription and push
   mechanism defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] and
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] can be used by the user to subscribe to
   notifications on the data nodes in this model.

   The model contains all the basic configuration parameters to operate
   the protocols listed above. Depending on the implementation choices,
   some systems may not allow some of the advanced parameters to be

   configurable. The occasionally implemented parameters are modeled as
   optional features in this model, while the rarely implemented
   parameters are not included this model and left for augmentation.
   This model can be extended, and has been structured in a way that
   such extensions can be conveniently made.

   The protocol parameters covered in this model can been seen from the
   model structure described in Section 3.

   The protocol parameters that were considered but are not covered in
   this model are described in the following sections.

2.1.1. Parameters Not Covered at Global Level

   The configuration parameters and operational states not covered on
   an IGMP instance or an MLD instance are:

      o Explicit tracking

      o Maximum transmit rate

      o Last member query count

      o Other querier present time

      o Send router alert

      o Startup query interval

      o Startup query count

2.1.2. Parameters Not Covered at Interface Level

   The configuration parameters and operational states not covered on
   an IGMP interface or an MLD interface are:

      o Disable router alert check

      o Drop IGMP version 1, IGMP version 2, or MLD version 1

      o Last member query count

      o Maximum number of sources

      o Other querier present time

      o Passive mode

      o Promiscuous mode

Internet-Draft          IGMP & MLD Yang Model                 June 2019


      o Query before immediate leave

      o Send router alert

2.2. Optional Capabilities

   This model is designed to represent the capabilities of IGMP and MLD
   devices with various specifications, including the basic capability
   subsets of the IGMP and MLD protocols.  The main design goals of
   this document are that the basic capabilities described in the model
   are supported by any major now-existing implementation, and that the
   configuration of all implementations meeting the specifications is
   easy to express through some combination of the optional features in
   the model and simple vendor augmentations.

   There is also value in widely-supported features being standardized,
   to provide a standardized way to access these features, to save work
   for individual vendors, and so that mapping between different
   vendors' configuration is not needlessly complicated. Therefore this
   model declares a number of features representing capabilities that
   not all deployed devices support.

   The extensive use of feature declarations should also substantially
   simplify the capability negotiation process for a vendor's IGMP and
   MLD implementations.

   On the other hand, operational state parameters are not so widely
   designated as features, as there are many cases where the defaulting
   of an operational state parameter would not cause any harm to the
   system, and it is much more likely that an implementation without
   native support for a piece of operational state would be able to
   derive a suitable value for a state variable that is not natively
   supported.

2.3. Position of Address Family in Hierarchy

   The protocol IGMP only supports IPv4, while the protocol MLD only
   supports IPv6. The data model defined in this document can be used
   for both IPv4 and IPv6 address families.

   This document defines IGMP and MLD as separate schema branches in
   the structure. The benefits are:

     o The model can support IGMP (IPv4), MLD (IPv6), or both
        optionally and independently. Such flexibility cannot be
        achieved cleanly with a combined branch.

     o The structure is consistent with other YANG models such as RFC
        8344, which uses separate branches for IPv4 and IPv6.

Internet-Draft          IGMP & MLD Yang Model                 June 2019


     o The separate branches for IGMP and MLD can accommodate their
        differences better and cleaner.  The two branches can better
        support different features and node types.

3. Module Structure

   This model augments the core routing data model specified in
   [RFC8349].

         +--rw routing
            +--rw router-id?
            +--rw control-plane-protocols
            |  +--rw control-plane-protocol* [type name]
            |     +--rw type
            |     +--rw name
            |     +--rw igmp     <= Augmented by this Model
                        ...
            |     +--rw mld      <= Augmented by this Model
                        ...

   The "igmp" container instantiates an IGMP protocol of version
   IGMPv1, IGMPv2, or IGMPv3. The "mld" container instantiates an MLD
   protocol of version MLDv1 or MLDv2.

   The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342]. The operational
   state data is combined with the associated configuration data in the
   same hierarchy [RFC8407].

   A configuration data node is marked as mandatory only when its value
   must be provided by the user. Where nodes are not essential to
   protocol operation, they are marked as optional. Some other nodes
   are essential but have a default specified, so that they are also
   optional and need not be configured explicitly.

3.1. IGMP Configuration and Operational State

   The IGMP data is modeled as a schema subtree augmenting the
   "control-plane-protocol" data node under "/rt:routing/rt:control-
   plane-protocols" in the module ietf-routing, following the
   convention described in [RFC8349]. The augmentation to the module
   ietf-routing allows this model to support multiple instances of
   IGMP, but a restriction MAY be added depending on the implementation
   and the device. The identity "igmp" is derived from the "rt:control-
   plane-protocol" base identity and indicates that a control-plane-
   protocol instance is IGMP.

   The IGMP subtree is a three-level hierarchy structure as listed
   below:

      Global level: Including IGMP configuration and operational state
   attributes for the entire IGMP protocol instance in this router.

      Interface-global level: Including configuration data nodes that
   are applicable to all the interfaces whose corresponding nodes are
   not defined or not configured at the interface level. For such a
   node at the interface level, the system uses the same value of the
   corresponding node at the interface-global level.

      Interface level: Including IGMP configuration and operational
   state attributes specific to the given interface. For a
   configuration node at the interface level, there may exist a
   corresponding configuration node with the same name at the
   interface-global level. The value configured on a node at the
   interface level overrides the value configured on the corresponding
   node at the interface-global level.

3.2. MLD Configuration and Operational State

   The MLD data is modeled as a schema subtree augmenting the "control-
   plane-protocol" data node under "/rt:routing/rt:control-plane-
   protocols" in the module ietf-routing, following the convention
   described in [RFC8349]. The augmentation to the module ietf-routing
   allows this model to support multiple instances of MLD, but a
   restriction MAY be added depending on the implementation and the
   device. The identity "mld" is derived from the "rt:control-plane-
   protocol" base identity and indicates that a control-plane-protocol
   instance is MLD.

   The MLD subtree is a three-level hierarchy structure as listed
   below:

      Global level: Including MLD configuration and operational state
   attributes for the entire MLD protocol instance in this router.

      Interface-global level: Including configuration data nodes that
   are applicable to all the interfaces whose corresponding nodes are
   not defined or not configured at the interface level. For such a
   node at the interface level, the system uses the same value of the
   corresponding node at the interface-global level.

      Interface level: Including MLD configuration and operational
   state attributes specific to the given interface. For a
   configuration node at the interface level, there may exist a

   corresponding configuration node with the same name at the
   interface-global level. The value configured on a node at the
   interface level overrides the value configured on the corresponding
   node at the interface-global level.

5. Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040]. The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242]. The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that
   are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default). These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments. Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations. These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Under /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
   /rt:control-plane-protocol/igmp-mld:igmp,

   igmp-mld:global

     This subtree specifies the configuration for the IGMP attributes
     at the global level on an IGMP instance.  Modifying the
     configuration can cause IGMP membership to be deleted or
     reconstructed on all the interfaces of an IGMP instance.

   igmp-mld:interfaces

     This subtree specifies the configuration for the IGMP attributes
     at the interface-global level on a IGMP instance.  Modifying the
     configuration can cause IGMP membership to be deleted or
     reconstructed on all the interfaces of an IGMP instance.

   igmp-mld:interfaces/interface

Internet-Draft          IGMP & MLD Yang Model                 June 2019


     This subtree specifies the configuration for the IGMP attributes
     at the interface level on an IGMP instance.  Modifying the
     configuration can cause IGMP membership to be deleted or
     reconstructed on a specific interface of an IGMP instance.

  Under /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
  /rt:control-plane-protocol/igmp-mld:mld,

   igmp-mld:global

     This subtree specifies the configuration for the MLD attributes at
     the global level on an MLD instance.  Modifying the configuration
     can cause MLD membership to be deleted or reconstructed on all the
     interfaces of an MLD instance.

   igmp-mld:interfaces

     This subtree specifies the configuration for the MLD attributes at
     the interface-global level on an MLD instance.  Modifying the
     configuration can cause MLD membership to be deleted or
     reconstructed on all the interfaces of an MLD instance.

   igmp-mld:interfaces/interface

     This subtree specifies the configuration for the MLD attributes at
     the interface level on a device.  Modifying the configuration can
     cause MLD membership to be deleted or reconstructed on a specific
     interface of an MLD instance.





   Unauthorized access to any data node of these subtrees can adversely
   affect the membership records of multicast routing subsystem on the
   local device.  This may lead to network malfunctions, delivery of
   packets to inappropriate destinations, and other problems.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes. These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
   /rt:control-plane-protocol/igmmp-mld:igmp

   /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
   /rt:control-plane-protocol/igmp-mld:mld

   Unauthorized access to any data node of the above subtree can
   disclose the operational state information of IGMP or MLD on this
   device.

   Some of the action operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus
   important to control access to these operations. These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
   /rt:control-plane-protocol/igmmp-mld:igmp/igmmp-mld:clear-groups

   /rt:routing/rt:control-plane-protocols
   /rt:control-plane-protocol/igmp-mld:mld/igmp-mld:clear-groups

   Unauthorized access to any of the above action operations can delete
   the IGMP or MLD membership records on this device.
