Internet-Draft                  LoST Sync                  February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The LoST (Location-to-Service Translation) protocol [2] maps
   geographic locations to service URLs.  As specified in the LoST
   architecture description [3], there are a variety of LoST servers
   that cooperate to provide a global, scalable and resilient mapping
   service.  The LoST protocol specification only describes the protocol
   used for individual seeker-originated queries.  This document adds
   LoST operations that allow forest guides, resolver clusters and
   authoritative servers to synchronize their database of mappings.

   In the LoST architecture, servers can peer, i.e., have an on-going
   data exchange relationship.  Peering relationships are set up
   manually, based on local policies.  A server can peer with any number
   of other servers.  Forest guides peer with other forest guides;
   resolvers peer with forest guides and other resolvers (in the same
   cluster); authoritative mapping servers peer with forest guides and
   other authoritative servers, either in the same cluster or above or
   below them in the tree.  If the type of LoST role does not matter, we
   refer to LoST protocol participants as LoST nodes.

   Authoritative mapping servers push coverage regions "up" the tree,
   i.e., from child nodes to parent nodes.  The child informs the parent
   of the geospatial or civic region that it covers.  [TBD: How
   referenced?]

   The coverage regions of different authoritative servers can overlap.
   This should only happen if the authoritative servers are
   misconfigured or if there is a political dispute that involves
   competing claims for the same region.  A server MUST detect such
   colliding claims and implement a policy to resolve the collision,
   either through an automated policy mechanism or manual intervention.

   This extension defines two new requests, <pushMappingsRequest> and
   <getMappingsRequest>, that allow peering servers to exchange
   mappings.  These requests are used for all peering relationships and
   always contain mapping entries, but naturally the content of the data
   exchanged differs.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT","RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

   This document reuses terminology introduced by the mapping
   architecture document [3].

3.  Distributing Mappings via <pushMappingsRequest>

   When a LoST node obtains new information that is of interest to its
   peers, it pushes the new mappings to its peers.  This information
   might arrive through non-LoST means, such as a manual addition to the
   local mappings database, or through another LoST node, via a
   <pushMappings> request or a <getMappingsResponse> described later.
   Mappings in that request replace existing mappings with the same 'id'
   parameter and a more recent 'created' parameter.  (Enforcing the
   latter avoids that a node that wakes up injects outdated information
   into the system.)

   Each peer keeps track of which peer it has exchanged which mapping
   elements with.  Mapping elements are identified by the 'source',
   'sourceID' and 'version' parameters.  A mapping is considered the
   same if these three attributes match.  Nodes never push the same
   information to the same peer twice.

   Instead of providing the mappings themselves, the LoST client can
   include references to mappings that have changed since the last
   request, by including <m> entries.  The server then requests any out-
   of-date or missing mappings by including a subset of that list as <m>
   elements in a <getMappingsRequest> request.

   To delete a mapping, the content of the mapping is left empty.  The
   node can delete the mapping from its internal mapping database, but
   has to remember which peers it has distributed this update to.  The
   mapping is identified only by the 'sourceId' and 'source' parameters;
   the other parameters are ignored if present.  In other words, the
   delete operation affects all versions of a mapping.

   The response to <pushMappingsRequest> is <pushMappingsResponse>.  It
   only contains <errors> elements if there is an error condition.  Only
   the .... errors are defined (TBD).

   If the set of nodes that are synchronizing their data does not form a
   tree, it is possible that the same information arrives through
   several other nodes.  This is unavoidable, but generally only imposes
   a modest overhead.  (It would be possible to create a spanning tree
   in the same fashion as IP multicast, but the complexity does not seem
   warranted, giving the relatively low volume of data.)

   An example is shown in Figure 1.  In the example, the last mapping,
   with source lost:nj.us.example and mapping ID 'englewood', is being
   removed.

4.  Synchronizing Mapping Stores via <getMappingsRequest> and
    <getMappingsResponse>

   Get list of mappings identified by <m> elements.  The server may not
   be able to return all such mappings, but the client can easily tell
   which mappings were unavailable since it can compare the mapping
   identifiers to those returned in the mapping elements.

   Errors TBD.


5.  Synchronizing Mapping Stores via <syncMappingsRequest> and
    <syncMappingsResponse>

   While the <pushMappingsRequest> request allows new mappings to
   propagate, it does not allow a newly-arriving node to acquire all
   mappings maintained by another node.  Therefore, we introduce
   <syncMappingsRequest> and <syncMappingsResponse> to synchronize two
   mapping stores.  A LoST node wanting to synchronize its mapping store
   with another node issues a <getMappingsRequest>, containing an
   enumeration of the current mapping sources, source identifiers and
   versions in <m> elements.  The recipient of the request compares that
   list to its own list of mappings.  It then returns an unordered set
   of mappings that are more recent than the ones identified in the
   <getMappingsRequest>.  It also returns any mappings that it knows
   about that are not contained in the list at all.  Thus, a querier can
   get the complete listing of mappings by omitting 'm' elements
   altogether.

   The querier can limit the scope of the mappings returned by adding
   'source', 'sourceId', and 'version' attributes to
   <getMappingsRequest>.  If the 'source' attribute is specified, only
   mappings with that particular source attribute are considered.

   Similarly, the 'sourceId' attribute restricts mappings to those
   matching the attribute.  If 'version' is specified, 'sourceId' needs
   to be specified as well.  If 'sourceId' is provided, the 'source'
   attribute also needs to be included.  In other words, a querier
   cannot ask for all version 17 mappings regardless of source, for
   example. 'm' elements that do not match the <getMappingsRequest>
   attributes are silently ignored.

   Errors TBD.

   An example request and response is shown in Figure 2

6.  Security Considerations

   The LoST security considerations are discussed in [2].  The
   operations described in this document involve mutually-trusting LoST
   nodes.  These nodes need to authenticate each other, using mechanisms
   such as HTTP Digest, HTTP Basic over TLS or TLS client and server
   certificates.  Nodes implementing LoST MUST implement HTTP Basic
   authentication over TLS and MAY implement other authentication
   mechanisms.
