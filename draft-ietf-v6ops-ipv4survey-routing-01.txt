Abstract 

   This investigation work seeks to document all usage of IPv4 addresses 
   in currently deployed IETF Routing Area documented standards.  In 
   order to successfully transition from an all IPv4 Internet to an all 
   IPv6 Internet, many interim steps will be taken. One of these steps 
   is the evolution of current protocols that have IPv4 dependencies.  
   It is hoped that these protocols (and their implementations) will be 
   redesigned to be network address independent, but failing that will 
   at least dually support IPv4 and IPv6.  To this end, all Standards 
   (Full, Draft, and Proposed) as well as Experimental RFCs will be 
   surveyed and any dependencies will be documented.

                 Survey of IPv4 Addresses in Currently 
                  Deployed IETF Routing Area Standards 



1. Introduction 

   This work aims to document all usage of IPv4 addresses in currently 
   deployed IETF Routing Area documented standards. Also, throughout 
   this document there are discussions on how routing protocols might be 
   updated to support IPv6 addresses. 

   This material was originally presented within a single document, but 
   has subsequently been split into 7 documents conforming to the 
   current IETF main areas (Application, Internet, Operations & 
   Management, Routing, Security, Sub-IP and Transport). 

   The general overview, methodology and scope of the investigation for 
   the whole 7 documents can be found in the introduction of this set of 
   documents [1]. 


2. Document Organization 

   The main Sections of this document are described below. 

   Sections 3, 4, 5, and 6 each describe the raw analysis of Full, 
   Draft, and Proposed Standards, and Experimental RFCs.  Each RFC is 
   discussed in its turn starting with RFC 1 and ending with RFC 3247.  
   The comments for each RFC are "raw" in nature.  That is, each RFC is 
   discussed in a vacuum and problems or issues discussed do not "look 
   ahead" to see if the problems have already been fixed. 

   Section 7 is an analysis of the data presented in Sections 3, 4, 5, 
   and 6.  It is here that all of the results are considered as a whole 
   and the problems that have been resolved in later RFCs are 
   correlated. 


3. Full Standards 

   Full Internet Standards (most commonly simply referred to as 
   "Standards") are fully mature protocol specification that are widely 
   implemented and used throughout the Internet. 


3.1  RFC 904 Exterior Gateway Protocol 

   This RFC has been depreciated to Historic status and is not 
   considered.

                  Deployed IETF Routing Area Standards 
 
 
3.2  RFC 1009 Gateway Requirements 

   It is pointless to attempt to try and quantify the IPv4 references in 
   this document.  The document specifies operations of IPv4 
   routers/gateways.  Hence, it makes numerous references that are IPv4 
   specific. 

   Like RFC 1122, it is necessary to rewrite this document and create a 
   "IPv6 Gateway Requirements" standard. 


3.3  RFC 1058 Routing Information Protocol 

   This RFC has been reclassified as historic and replace by STD 56. See 
   Section 3.6 for its further discussion. 


3.4  Interface Message Processor: Specifications for the Interconnection 
    of a Host and an IMP 

   This standard STD 39 has been reclassified as historic and is not 
   considered in this discussion. 


3.5  RFC 2328 OSPF Version 2 

   This RFC defines a protocol for IPv4 routing.  It is highly 
   assumptive about address formats being IPv4 in nature.  A new version 
   of OSPF must be created to support IPv6. 


3.6  RFC 2453 RIP Version 2 

   RIPv2 is only intended for IPv4 networks.  IPv6 routing functionality 
   is contain in RIPng documented in RFC 2080. 


3.7  RFC 1722 RIP Version 2 Protocol Applicability Statement 

   RIPv2 is only intended for IPv4 networks.  IPv6 routing functionality 
   is contain in RIPng documented in RFC 2081.

4. Draft Standards 

   Draft Standards represent the penultimate standard level in the IETF.  
   A protocol can only achieve draft standard when there are multiple, 
   independent, interoperable implementations.  Draft Standards are 
   usually quite mature and widely used. 


4.1  RFC 1771 A Border Gateway Protocol 4 (BGP-4) 

   This RFC defines a protocol used for exchange of IPv4 routing 
   information and does not support IPv6.  A new EGP must be defined for 
   the exchange of IPv6 routing information. 


4.2  RFC 1772 Application of the Border Gateway Protocol in the Internet 
    (BGP-4-APP) 

   This RFC is a discussion of the use of BGP4 on the Internet.  Since 
   BGP4 is limited to IPv4 addresses, it is expected that a similar 
   document will be created to be paired with the definition of the next 
   generation BGP. 


5. Proposed Standards 

   Proposed Standards are introductory level documents.  There are no 
   requirements for even a single implementation.  In many cases 
   Proposed are never implemented or advanced in the IETF standards 
   process.  They therefore are often just proposed ideas that are 
   presented to the Internet community.  Sometimes flaws are exposed or 
   they are one of many competing solutions to problems.  In these later 
   cases, no discussion is presented as it would not serve the purpose 
   of this discussion. 


5.1  RFC 1195 Use of OSI IS-IS for routing in TCP/IP and dual 
    environments (IS-IS) 

   This document specifies a protocol for the exchange of IPv4 routing 
   information.  It is incompatible with IPv6.  There are substantial 
   work being done on a newer version of IS-IS that should include IPv6 
   routing.

                  Deployed IETF Routing Area Standards 


5.2  RFC 1370 Applicability Statement for OSPF 

   This document discusses a version of OSPF that is limited to IPv4.  
   It is expected that a similar document be assigned for when a version 
   of OSPF that supports IPv6 is established. 


5.3  RFC 1397 Default Route Advertisement In BGP2 and BGP3 Version of The 
    Border Gateway Protocol 

   BGP2 and BGP3 are both depreciated and therefore are not discussed in 
   this document. 


5.4  RFC 1403 BGP OSPF Interaction (BGP-OSPF) 

   This document discusses the interaction between two routing protocols 
   and how they exchange IPv4 information.  A similar document should be 
   produced when versions of OSPF and BGP that support IPv6. 


5.5  RFC 1478 An Architecture for Inter-Domain Policy Routing (IDPR-ARCH) 

   The architecture described in this document has no IPv4 dependencies. 


5.6  RFC 1479 Inter-Domain Policy Routing Protocol Specification: Version 
    1 (IDPR) 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol. 


5.7  RFC 1517 Applicability Statement for the Implementation of Classless 
    Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) (CIDR) 

   This document deals exclusively with IPv4 addressing issue. 


5.8  RFC 1518 An Architecture for IP Address Allocation with CIDR (CIDR-
    ARCH) 

   This document deals exclusively with IPv4 addressing issue. 


5.9  RFC 1519 Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR): an Address 
    Assignment and Aggregation Strategy (CIDR-STRA)

5.10   RFC 1582 Extensions to RIP to Support Demand Circuits (RIP-DC) 

   This protocol is an extension to a protocol for exchanging IPv4 
   routing information. 

   In Section 3 of RFC 1582, IP Routing Information Protocol Version 1 
   shows: 

   Followed by up to 25 routing entries (each 20 octets)

   The format of an IP RIP datagram in octets, with each tick mark 
   representing one bit.    All fields are in network order. 

   The four octets: sequence number (2), fragment number (1) and number 
   of fragments (1) are not present in the original RIP specification.  
   They are only present if command takes the values 7 or 8. 

         Figure 2.   IP Routing Information Protocol packet format 

   The Section referencing RIPv2 refers back to the above text. 


5.11   RFC 1584 Multicast Extensions to OSPF (OSPF-Multi) 

   This document defines the use of IPv4 multicast to an IPv4 routing 
   protocol.  A similar mechanism must be defined for IPv6.

5.12   RFC 1587 The OSPF NSSA Option (OSPF-NSSA) 

   This document defines an extension to an IPv4 routing protocol and it 
   is assumed that any updated version of OSPF to support IPv6 will 
   contain an appropriate update for this option. 


5.13   RFC 1745 BGP4/IDRP for IP---OSPF Interaction (BGP4/IDRP) 

   This document discusses the interaction between two routing protocols 
   and how they exchange IPv4 information.  A similar document should be 
   produced when versions of OSPF and BGP that support IPv6. 


5.14   RFC 1793 Extending OSPF to Support Demand Circuits (OSPF-DC) 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol other than the fact 
   that it is an new functionality for a routing protocol that only 
   supports IPv4 networks.  It is assumed that a future update to OSPF 
   to support IPv6 will also support this functionality. 


5.15   RFC 1812 Requirements for IP Version 4 Routers 

   This document is only intended to describe requirements for IPv4 
   implementations in router. A similar document should be produced for 
   IPv6. 


5.16   RFC 1997 BGP Communities Attribute (BGP-COMM) 

   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, it is 
   an update to an IPv4 only routing protocol.  It is expected that a 
   newer version of BGP that is IPv6 aware will also implement this 
   enhancement. 


5.17   RFC 2080 RIPng for IPv6 (RIPNG-IPV6) 

   This RFC documents a protocol for exchanging IPv6 routing information 
   and is not discussed in this document.

   This RFC defines an enhancement for an IPv4 routing protocol and 
   while it has no IPv4 dependencies it is inherintely limited to IPv4.

   This is a link local scope multicast address.  Routers MUST NOT 
   forward a datagram with this destination address regardless of its 
   TTL. 

   There are numerous other references to 32-bit IP addresses.  There 
   does not seem to be any reason that a new version of this protocol 
   could be straightforwardly be developed for IPv6. 


5.20   RFC 2370 The OSPF Opaque LSA Option (OSPF-LSA) 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol other than the fact 
   that it is an new functionality for a routing protocol that only 
   supports IPv4 networks.  It is assumed that a future update to OSPF 
   to support IPv6 will also support this functionality. 


5.21   RFC 2439 BGP Route Flap Damping 

   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, it is 
   an update to an IPv4 only routing protocol.  It is expected that a 
   newer version of BGP that is IPv6 aware will also implement this 
   enhancement. 


5.22   RFC 2545 Use of BGP-4 Multiprotocol Extensions for IPv6 Inter-
    Domain Routing 

   This RFC documents IPv6 routing methods and is not discussed in this 
   document. 


5.23   RFC 2740 OSPF for IPv6 

   This document defines an IPv6 specific protocol and is not discussed 
   in this document. 


5.24   RFC 2784 Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) 

   This protocol is only defined for IPv4.  The document states in the 
   Appendix: 

   o IPv6 as Delivery and/or Payload Protocol

   This specification describes the intersection of GRE currently 
   deployed by multiple vendors. IPv6 as delivery and/or payload 
   protocol is not included. 

   Therefore, a new version must be defined for IPv6. 


5.25   RFC 2796 BGP Route Reflection - An Alternative to Full Mesh (IBGP) 

   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, it is 
   an update to an IPv4 only routing protocol.  It is expected that a 
   newer version of BGP that is IPv6 aware will also implement this 
   enhancement. 

   Conceptually there should be no issues with the protocol operating in 
   and IPv6 aware BGP. 


5.26   RFC 2842 Capabilities Advertisement with BGP-4 

   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, it is 
   an update to an IPv4 only routing protocol.  It is expected that a 
   newer version of BGP that is IPv6 aware will also implement this 
   enhancement. 

   Conceptually there should be no issues with the protocol operating in 
   and IPv6 aware BGP. 


5.27   RFC 2858 Multiprotocol Extensions for BGP-4 (MEXT-BGP4) 

   In the Abstract: 

   Currently BGP-4 [BGP-4] is capable of carrying routing information 
   only for IPv4 [IPv4]. This document defines extensions to BGP-4 to 
   enable it to carry routing information for multiple Network Layer 
   protocols (e.g., IPv6, IPX, etc...). The extensions are backward 
   compatible - a router that supports the extensions can interoperate 
   with a router that doesn∆t support the extensions. 

   The document is therefore no examined further in this document. 


5.28   RFC 2890 Key and Sequence Number Extensions to GRE 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.

5.29   RFC 2894 Router Renumbering for IPv6 

   The RFC defines an IPv6 only document and is not concerned in this 
   document. 


5.30   RFC 2918 Route Refresh Capability for BGP-4 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol. 


5.31   RFC 3065 Autonomous System Confederations for BGP (BGP-ASC) 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol. 


5.32   RFC 3107 Carrying Label Information in BGP-4 (SDP) 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol. 


5.33   RFC 3122 Extensions to IPv6 Neighbor Discovery for Inverse 
    Discovery Specification 

   This is an IPv6 related document and is not discussed in this 
   document. 

    
6. Experimental RFCs 

   Experimental RFCs typically define protocols that do not have 
   widescale implementation or usage on the Internet.  They are often 
   propriety in nature or used in limited arenas.  They are documented 
   to the Internet community in order to allow potential 
   interoperability or some other potential useful scenario.  In a few 
   cases they are presented as alternatives to the mainstream solution 
   to an acknowledged problem. 


6.1  RFC 1075 Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (IP-DVMRP) 

   This document defines a protocol for IPv4 multicast routing.  A 
   similar mechanism must be defined for IPv6 multicast routing (or the 
   functionality must be included in other "standard" IPv6 routing 
   protocols.)

                  Deployed IETF Routing Area Standards 


6.2  RFC 1383 An Experiment in DNS Based IP Routing (DNS-IP) 

   This proposal is IPv4 limited: 

   This record is designed for easy general purpose extensions in the 
   DNS, and its content is a text string. The RX record will contain 
   three fields: 

   -  A record identifier composed of the two characters "RX". This is 
   used to disambiguate from other experimental uses of the "TXT" 
   record. 

   -  A cost indicator, encoded on up to 3 numerical digits. The 
   corresponding positive integer value should be less that 256, in 
   order to preserve future evolutions. 

   -  An IP address, encoded as a text string following the "dot" 
   notation. 

   The three strings will be separated by a single comma. An example of 
   record would thus be: 
    ___________________________________________________________________ 
    |         domain          |   type |   record |   value           | 
    |            -            |        |          |                   | 
    |*.27.32.192.in-addr.arpa |   IP   |    TXT   |   RX, 10, 10.0.0.7| 
    |_________________________|________|__________|___________________| 


   which means that for all hosts whose IP address starts by the three 
   octets "192.32.27" the IP host "10.0.0.7" can be used as a gateway, 
   and that the preference value is 10. 


6.3  RFC 1476 RAP: Internet Route Access Protocol (RAP) 

   This document defines an IPv7 routing protocol and has been abandoned 
   by the IETF as a feasible design.  It is not considered in this 
   document. 


6.4  RFC 1765 OSPF Database Overflow (OSPF-OVFL) 

   There are no IPv4 dependencies in this protocol other than the fact 
   that it is a new functionality for a routing protocol that only 
   supports IPv4 networks.  It is assumed that a future update to OSPF 
   to support IPv6 will also support this functionality.

6.5  RFC 1863 A BGP/IDRP Route Server alternative to a full mesh routing 
    (BGP-IDRP) 

   This protocol is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes. 


6.6  RFC 1966 BGP Route Reflection An alternative to full mesh IBGP (BGP-
    RR) 

   Although the protocol enhancements have no IPv4 dependencies, it is 
   an update to an IPv4 only routing protocol.  It is expected that a 
   newer version of BGP that is IPv6 aware will also implement this 
   enhancement. 

   Conceptually there should be no issues with the protocol operating in 
   and IPv6 aware BGP. 


6.7  RFC 2189 Core Based Trees (CBT version 2) Multicast Routing 

   The document specifies a protocol that depends on IPv4 multicast.  It 
   is expected that it could easily be updated to support IPv6 
   multicasting.

   This protocol is both IPv4 and IPv6 aware and needs no changes. 


6.11   RFC 2676 QoS Routing Mechanisms and OSPF Extensions 

   There are IPv4 dependencies in this protocol.  It requires the use of 
   the IPv4 TOS header field.  It is assumed that a future update to 
   OSPF to support IPv6 will also support this functionality.

7. Summary of Results 

   In the initial survey of RFCs 25 positives were identified out of a 
   total of 53, broken down as follows: 

   Standards                 2 of  7 or 28.57% 

   Draft Standards           1 of  2 or 50.00% 

   Proposed Standards       17 of 33 or 51.52% 

   Experimental RFCs         5 of 11 or 45.45% 

   Of those identified many require no action because they document 
   outdated and unused protocols, while others are document protocols 
   that are actively being updated by the appropriate working groups. 
   Additionally there are many instances of standards that should be 
   updated but do not cause any operational impact if they are not 
   updated. The remaining instances are documented below. 

   The authors have attempted to organize the results in a format that 
   allows easy reference to other protocol designers. The assignment of 
   statements has been based entirely on the authors perceived needs for 
   updates and should not be taken as an official statement.
