1.  Introduction

   This document introduces a YANG [RFC7950] [RFC6991] data model for
   Layer 3 network topologies, specifically Layer 3 Unicast.  The model
   allows an application to have a holistic view of the topology of a
   Layer 3 network, all contained in a single conceptual YANG datastore.
   The data model builds on top of, and augments, the data model for
   network topologies defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo].

   This document also shows how the model can be further refined to
   cover different Layer 3 Unicast topology types.  For this purpose, an
   example model is introduced that covers OSPF [RFC2328].  This example
   is intended purely for illustrative purpose; we expect that a
   complete OSPF model will be more comprehensive and refined than the
   example shown here.

   There are multiple applications for a topology data model.  A number
   of use cases have been defined in section 6 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary].  For example, nodes
   within the network can use the data model to capture their
   understanding of the overall network topology and expose it to a
   network controller.  A network controller can then use the
   instantiated topology data to compare and reconcile its own view of
   the network topology with that of the network elements that it
   controls.  Alternatively, nodes within the network could propagate
   this understanding to compare and reconcile this understanding either
   amongst themselves or with help of a controller.  Beyond the network
   element itself, a network controller might even use the data model to
   represent its view of the topology that it controls and expose it to
   applications north of itself.

   The data model for Layer 3 Unicast topologies defined in this
   document is specified in a YANG module "ietf-l3-unicast-topology".
   To do so, it augments the general network topology model defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] with information specific to
   Layer 3 Unicast.  This way, the general topology model is extended to
   be able to meet the needs of Layer 3 Unicast topologies.

   Information that is kept in the Traffic Engineering Database (TED)
   will be specified in a separate model
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-yang-te-topo] and outside the scope of this
   specification.

2.  Key Words

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Definitions and Acronyms

   As this document defines a YANG data model, in this document many
   terms are used that have been defined in conjunction with YANG
   [RFC7950] and NETCONF [RFC6241].  Some terms, such as datastore and
   data tree, are repeated here for clarity and to put them in context.

   Datastore: A conceptual place to store and access information.  A
   datastore might be implemented, for example, using files, a database,
   flash memory locations, or combinations thereof.  A datastore maps to
   an instantiated YANG data tree.  (Definition adopted from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores])

4.  Model Structure

   The Layer 3 Unicast topology model is defined by YANG module "l3-
   unicast-topology".  The relationship of this module with other YANG
   modules is roughly depicted in the figure below.

                     Figure 1: Overall model structure

   YANG modules "ietf-network" and "ietf-network-topology" collectively
   define the basic network topology model
   [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo].  YANG module "ietf-l3-
   unicast-topology" augments those models with additional definitions
   needed to represent Layer 3 Unicast topologies.  This module in turn
   can be augmented by YANG modules with additional definitions for
   specific types of Layer 3 Unicast topologies, such as OSPF and for
   IS-IS topologies.

   The YANG modules ietf-network and ietf-network-topology are designed
   to be used in conjunction with implementations that support the
   Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  Accordingly, the same is
   true for the YANG modules that augment it.  In order to allow
   implementations to use the model even in cases when NMDA is not
   supported, companion YANG modules (that SHOULD NOT be supported by
   implementations that support NMDA) are defined in an Appendix, see
   Appendix A.

5.  Layer 3 Unicast Topology Model Overview

   The Layer 3 Unicast topology model is defined by YANG module "ietf-
   l3-unicast-topology".  Its structure is depicted in the following
   diagram.  The notation syntax follows
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].  For purposes of brevity,
   notifications are not depicted.

             +--:(interface-name)
                +--rw interface-name?   string

   The module augments the original ietf-network and ietf-network-
   topology modules as follows:

   o  A new network topology type is introduced, l3-unicast-topology.
      The corresponding container augments the network-types of the
      ietf-network module.

   o  Additional topology attributes are introduced, defined in a
      grouping, which augments the "network" list of the network module.
      The attributes include a name for the topology, as well as a set
      of flags (represented through a leaf-list).  Each type of flag is
      represented by a separate identity.  This allows to introduce
      additional flags in augmenting modules using additional identities
      without needing to revise this module.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-l3-topology-16.txt   December 2017


   o  Additional data objects for nodes are introduced by augmenting the
      "node" list of the network module.  New objects include again a
      set of flags, as well as a list of prefixes.  Each prefix in turn
      includes an ip prefix, a metric, and a prefix-specific set of
      flags.

   o  Links (in the ietf-network-topology module) are augmented with a
      set of parameters as well, allowing to associate a link with a
      link name, another set of flags, and a link metric.

   o  Termination points (in the ietf-network-topology module as well)
      are augmented with a choice of IP address, identifier, or name.

   In addition, the module defines a set of notifications to alert
   clients of any events concerning links, nodes, prefixes, and
   termination points.  Each notification includes an indication of the
   type of event, the topology from which it originated, and the
   affected node, or link, or prefix, or termination point.  In
   addition, as a convenience to applications, additional data of the
   affected node, or link, or termination point (respectively) is
   included.  While this makes notifications larger in volume than they
   would need to be, it avoids the need for subsequent retrieval of
   context information, which also might have changed in the meantime.

7.  Interactions with Other YANG Modules

   As described in section Section 4, the model builds on top of, and
   augments, the YANG modules defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo].  Specifically, module ietf-
   l3-unicast-topology augments modules "ietf-network" and "ietf-
   network-topology".  In addition, the model makes use of data types
   that have been defined in [RFC6991].

   The model defines a protocol independent YANG data model with layer 3
   topology information.  It is separate from and not linked with data
   models that are used to configure routing protocols or routing
   information.  This includes e.g. model "ietf-routing" [RFC8022] and
   model "ietf-fb-rib" [I-D.draft-acee-rtgwg-yang-rib-extend].  That
   said, the model does import a type definition from model "ietf-
   routing-types" [RFC8294].

   The model obeys the requirements for the ephemeral state found in the
   document [RFC8242].  For ephemeral topology data that is server
   provided, the process tasked with maintaining topology information
   will load information from the routing process (such as OSPF) into
   the data model without relying on a configuration datastore.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URIs in the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-unicast-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-unicast-topology-state
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG modules in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020]:

   Name: ietf-l3-unicast-topology
   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-unicast-topology
   Prefix: l3t

   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-l3-unicast-topology-state

9.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   In general, Layer 3 Unicast topologies are system-controlled and
   provide ephemeral topology information.  In an NMDA-complient server,
   they are only part of <operational> which provides read-only access
   to clients, they are less vulnerable.  That said, the YANG module
   does in principle allow information to be configurable.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability in the ietf-network module:

      l3-topology-attributes: A malicious client could attempt to
      sabotage the configuration of any of the ctonained attributes,
      i.e. the name or the flag data nodes.

      l3-node-attributes: A malicious client could attempt to sabotage
      the configuration of important node attributes, such as the
      router-id or node prefix.

      l3-link-attributes: A malicious client could attempt to sabotage
      the configuration of important link attributes, such as name,
      flag, and metrics of the link respectively corresponding data
      nodes.

      l3-termination-point-attributes: A malicious client could attempt
      to sabotage the configuration information of a termination point,
      such as its ip-address and interface name, respectively the
      corresponding data nodes.

Appendix A.  Companion YANG model for non-NMDA compliant implementations

   The YANG module ietf-l3-unicast-topology defined in this document
   augments two modules, ietf-network and ietf-network-topology, that
   are designed to be used in conjunction with implementations that
   support the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined
   in [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-revised-datastores].  In order to allow
   implementations to use the model even in cases when NMDA is not
   supported, a set of companion modules have been defined that
   represent a state model of networks and network topologies, ietf-
   network-state and ietf-network-topology-state, respectively.

   In order to be able to use the model for layer 3 topologies defined
   in this in this document in conjunction with non-NMDA compliant
   implementations, a corresponding companion module needs to be
   introduced as well.  This companion module, ietf-l3-unicast-topology-
   state, mirrors ietf-l3-unicast-topology.  However, the module
   augments ietf-network-state and ietf-network-topology-state (instead
   of ietf-network and ietf-network-topology) and all of its data nodes
   are non-configurable.

   Similar considerations apply for any modules that augment ietf-l3-
   unicast-topology, such as the example modules defined in see
   Appendix B, example-ospf-topology.  For non-NMDA compliant
   implementations, companion modules will need to be introduced that
   represent state information and are non-configurable, augmenting
   ietf-l3-unicast-topology-state instead of ietf-l3-unicast-topology.
   Because they served as examples only, companion modules for those
   examples are not given.

   Like ietf-network-state and ietf-network-topology-state, ietf-l3-
   unicast-topology SHOULD NOT be supported by implementations that
   support NMDA.  It is for this reason that the module is defined in
   the Appendix.

   The definition of the module follows below.  As the structure of the
   module mirrors that of its underlying module, the YANG tree is not
   depicted separately.

Appendix B.  Extending the Model

   The model can be extended for specific Layer 3 Unicast types.
   Examples include OSPF and IS-IS topologies.  In the following, one
   additional YANG module is introduced that define simple topology
   model for OSPF.  This module is intended to serve as an example that
   illustrates how the general topology model can be refined across
   multiple levels.  It does not constitute full-fledged OSPF topology
   model which may be more comprehensive and refined than the model that
   is described here.

B.1.  Example OSPF Topology

B.1.1.  Model Overview

   The following model shows how the Layer 3 Unicast topology model can
   be extended, in this case to cover OSFP topologies.  For this
   purpose, a set of augmentations are introduced in a separate YANG
   module, "example-ospf-topology", whose structure is depicted in the
   following diagram.  As before, the notation syntax follows
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netmod-yang-tree-diagrams].

  augment /l3t:l3-link-event:

    +---- ospf-link-attributes

   The module augments "ietf-l3-unicast-topology" as follows:

   o  A new topology type for an OSPF topology is introduced.

   o  Additional topology attributes are defined in a new grouping which
      augments l3-topology-attributes of the ietf-l3-unicast-topology
      module.  The attributes include an OSPF area-id identifying the
      OSPF area.

Internet-Draft   draft-ietf-i2rs-yang-l3-topology-16.txt   December 2017


   o  Additional data objects for nodes are introduced by augmenting the
      l3-node-attributes of the l3-unicast-topology module.  New objects
      include router-type and dr-interface-id for pseudonodes.

   o  Links are augmented with ospf link attributes.

   In addition, the module extends notifications for events concerning
   Layer 3 nodes and links with OSPF attributes.

   It should be noted that the model defined here represents topology
   and is intended as an example.  It does not define how to configure
   OSPF routers or interfaces.

B.1.2.  OSPF Topology YANG Module

   The OSPF Topology YANG Module is specified below.  As mentioned, the
   module is intended as an example for how the Layer 3 Unicast topology
   model can be extended to cover OSFP topologies, but it is not
   normative.  Accordingly, the module is not delimited with CODE BEGINS
   and CODE ENDS tags.

Appendix C.  An Example

   This section contains an example of an instance data tree in JSON
   encoding [RFC7951].  The example instantiates ietf-l3-unicast-
   topology for the topology that is depicted in the following diagram.
   There are three nodes, D1, D2, and D3.  D1 has three termination
   points, 1-0-1, 1-2-1, and 1-3-1.  D2 has three termination points as
   well, 2-1-1, 2-0-1, and 2-3-1.  D3 has two termination points, 3-1-1
   and 3-2-1.  In addition there are six links, two between each pair of
   nodes with one going in each direction.
