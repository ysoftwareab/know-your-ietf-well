               draft-ietf-trill-transport-over-mpls-08.txt


Abstract

   This document specifies methods to interconnect multiple Transparent
   Interconnection of Lots of links (TRILL) sites with an intervening
   MPLS network using existing TRILL and VPLS standards. This draft
   addresses two problems as follows:

   1) Providing connection between more than two TRILL sites that are
      separated by an MPLS provider network.

   2) Providing a single logical virtualized TRILL network for different
      tenants that are separated by an MPLS provider network.

INTERNET-DRAFT                     TRILL Transparent Transport over MPLS


1. Introduction

   The IETF Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL)
   protocol [RFC6325] [RFC7177] [RFC7780] provides transparent
   forwarding in multi-hop networks with arbitrary topology and link
   technologies using a header with a hop count and link-state routing.
   TRILL provides optimal pair-wise forwarding without configuration,
   safe forwarding even during periods of temporary loops, and support
   for multipathing of both unicast and multicast traffic. Intermediate
   Systems (ISs) implementing TRILL are called Routing Bridges
   (RBridges) or TRILL Switches

   This document, in conjunction with [RFC7173] on TRILL Transport using
   Pseudowires, addresses two problems:

   1) Providing connection between more than two TRILL sites belongs to
      a single TRILL network that are separated by an MPLS provider
      network using [RFC7173]. (Herein also called problem statement 1.)

   2) Providing a single logical virtualized TRILL network for different
      tenants that are separated by an MPLS provider network. In short
      providing connection between TRILL sites belonging to a
      tenant/tenants over a MPLS provider network. (Herein also called
      problem statement 2.)

   A tenant is the administrative entity on whose behalf their
   associated services are managed. Here tenant refers to a TRILL campus
   that is segregated from other tenants for security reasons.

   A key multi-tenancy requirement is traffic isolation so that one
   tenant's traffic is not visible to any other tenant. This draft also
   addresses the problem of multi-tenancy by isolating one tenant's
   traffic from the other.

   [RFC7173] mentions how to interconnect a pair of Transparent
   Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) switch ports using
   pseudowires.  This document explains, how to connect multiple TRILL
   sites (not limited to only two sites) using the mechanisms and
   encapsulations defined in [RFC7173].

2. TRILL Over MPLS Model

   TRILL Over MPLS can be achieved in two different ways.

         a) the VPLS Model for TRILL
         b) the VPTS Model/TIR Model for TRILL

   Both these models can be used to solve problem statements 1 and 2.
   Herein the VPLS Model for TRILL is also called Model 1 and the VPTS
   Model/TIR Model is also called Model 2.

   Virtual Service Instances that segregate Tenant1's traffic from other
   tenant traffic.  VSI1 will maintain its own database for Tenant1,
   similarly VSI2 will maintain its own database for Tenant2.

                Figure 2. Topological Model for VPLS Model
                  connecting 2 Tenants with 3 sites each

   In this model, TRILL sites are connected to VPLS-capable PE devices
   that provide a logical interconnect, such that TRILL RBridges
   belonging to a specific tenant connected via an single bridged
   Ethernet. These PE devices are the same as the PE devices specified
   in [RFC4026]. The Attachment Circuit ports of PE Routers are layer 2
   switch ports that are connected to the RBridges at a TRILL site. Here
   each VPLS instance looks like an emulated LAN. This model is similar
   to connecting different RBridges by a layer 2 bridge domain (multi
   access link) as specified in [RFC6325]. This model doesn't requires
   any changes in PE routers to carry TRILL packets, as TRILL packets
   will be transferred transparently.



3.1 Entities in the VPLS Model

   The PE (VPLS-PE) and CE devices are defined in [RFC4026].

   The Generic L2VPN Transport Functional Components like Attachment
   Circuits, Pseudowires, VSI etc. are defined in [RFC4664].

   The RB (RBridge) and TRILL Sites are defined in [RFC6325] as updated
   by [RFC7780].

INTERNET-DRAFT                     TRILL Transparent Transport over MPLS


3.2 TRILL Adjacency for VPLS model

   As specified in section 3 of this document, the MPLS cloud looks like
   an emulated LAN (also called multi-access link or broadcast link).
   This results in RBridges at different sites looking like they are
   connected by a multi-access link. With such interconnection, the
   TRILL adjacencies over the link are automatically discovered and
   established through TRILL IS-IS control messages [RFC7177]. These IS-
   IS control messages are transparently forwarded by the VPLS domain,
   after doing MPLS encapsulation as specified in the section 3.4.



3.3 MPLS encapsulation for VPLS model

   Use of VPLS [RFC4762] [RFC4761] to interconnect TRILL sites requires
   no changes to a VPLS implementation, in particular the use of
   Ethernet pseudowires between VPLS PEs. A VPLS PE receives normal
   Ethernet frames from an RBridge (i.e., CE) and is not aware that the
   CE is an RBridge device. As an example, an MPLS-encapsulated TRILL
   packet within the MPLS network can use the format illustrated in
   Appendix A of [RFC7173] for the non-PBB case. For the PBB case,
   additional header fields illustrated in [RFC7041] can be added by
   entry PE and removed by the exit PE.



3.4 Loop Free provider PSN/MPLS

   No explicit handling is required to avoid loop free topology. Split
   Horizon technique specified in [RFC4664] will take care of avoiding
   loops in the provider PSN network.



3.5 Frame Processing

   The PE devices transparently process the TRILL control and data
   frames. Procedures to forward the frames are defined in [RFC4664].

4. VPTS Model

   The VPTS (Virtual Private TRILL Service) is a L2 TRILL service, that
   emulates TRILL service across a Wide Area Network (WAN). VPTS is
   similar to what VPLS does for bridge core but provides a TRILL core.
   VPLS provides "Virtual Private LAN Service" for different customers.
   VPTS provides "Virtual Private TRILL Service" for different TRILL
   tenants.

   Figure 3 shows the topological model of TRILL over MPLS using VPTS.
   In this model the PE routers are replaced with TIR (TRILL
   Intermediate Router) and VSI is replaced with VTSD (Virtual TRILL
   Switch Domain). The TIR devices must be capable of supporting both
   MPLS and TRILL as specified in section 4.1.1. The TIR devices are
   interconnected via PWs and appear as a unified emulated TRILL campus
   with each VTSD inside a TIR equivalent to a RBridge.

   Some of the reasons for interconnecting TRILL Sites without isolating
   the TRILL Control plane of one TRILL site from other sites are as
   described below.

   1) Nickname Uniqueness: One of the basic requirements of TRILL is
      that, RBridge Nicknames are unique within the campus [RFC6325]. If
      we segregate control plane of one TRILL site from other TRILL site
      and provide interconnection between these sites, it may result in
      Nickname collision.

   2) Distribution Trees and their pruning: When a TRILL Data packet
      traverses a Distribution Tree, it will stay on it even in other
      TRILL sites. If no end-station service is enabled for a particular
      Data Label in a TRILL site, the Distribution Tree may be pruned
      and TRILL data packets of that particular Data Label might never
      get to another TRILL site where the pckets had no receivers. The
      TRILL RPF check will always be performed on the packets that are
      received by TIRs through pseudowires.

   3) Hop Count values: When a TRILL data packet is received over a
      pseudowire by a TIR, the TIR does the processing of Hop Count
      defined in [RFC6325] and will not perform any resetting of Hop
      Count.

                   Figure 3. Topological Model of VPTS/TIR
                         connecting three TRILL Sites

   In the above Figure 3, Site1, Site2 and Site3 (running the TRILL
   protocol) are connected to TIR Devices. These TIR devices, along with
   the MPLS cloud, look like an unified emulated TRILL network. Only the
   PE devices in the MPLS network should be replaced with TIRs so the
   intermediate Provider routers are agnostic to the TRILL protocol.

   Figure 4 below extends the topological model of TRILL over MPLS to
   connect multiple TRILL sites belonging to a tenant (tenant here is a
   campus, not a Data label) using VPTS model. VTSD1 and VTSD2 are two
   Virtual TRILL Switch Domains (Virtual RBridges) that segregate
   Tenant1's traffic from Tenant2's traffic. VTSD1 will maintain its own
   TRILL database for Tenant1. Similarly VTSD2 will maintain its own
   TRILL database for Tenant2.

                connecting 2 tenants with three TRILL Sites



4.1 Entities in the VPTS Model

   The CE devices are defined in [RFC4026].

   The Generic L2VPN Transport Functional Components like Attachment
   Circuits, Pseudowires etc. are defined in [RFC4664].

   The RB (RBridge) and TRILL Campus are defined in [RFC6325] as updated
   by [RFC7780].

   This model introduces two new entities called TIR and VTSD that are
   described below.



4.1.1 TRILL Intermediate Routers (TIR)

   The TIRs (TRILL Intermediate Routers) must be capable of running both
   VPLS and TRILL protocols. TIR devices are a superset of the VPLS-PE
   devices defined in [RFC4026] with the additional functionality of
   TRILL. The VSI instance that provides transparent bridging
   functionality in the PE device is replaced with VTSD in a TIR.

INTERNET-DRAFT                     TRILL Transparent Transport over MPLS


4.1.2 Virtual TRILL Switch/Service Domain (VTSD)

   The VTSD (Virtual Trill Switch Domain) is similar to VSI (layer 2
   bridge) in the VPLS model, but the VTSD acts as a TRILL RBridge. The
   VTSD is a superset of VSI and must support all the functionality
   provided by the VSI as defined in [RFC4026]. Along with VSI
   functionality, the VTSD must be capable of supporting TRILL protocols
   and forming TRILL adjacencies. The VTSD must be capable of performing
   all the operations that a standard TRILL Switch can do.

   One VTSD instance per tenant must be maintained, when multiple
   tenants are connected to a TIR. The VTSD must maintain all the
   information maintained by the RBridge on a per tenant basis. The VTSD
   must also take care of segregating one tenant traffic from other.
   Each VTSD will have its own nickname for each tenant, If a TIR
   supports 10 TRILL tenants, it needs to be assigned with ten TRILL
   nicknames, one for the nickname space of each of its tenants, and run
   ten copies of TRILL protocols, one for each tenant. It is possible
   that it would have the same nickname for two or more tenants but,
   since the TRILL data and control traffic are separated for the
   tenants, there is no confusion.



4.2 TRILL Adjacency for VPTS model

   The VTSD must be capable of forming TRILL adjacency with the
   corresponding VTSDs present in its peer VPTS neighbor, and also the
   neighbor RBridges present in the TRILL sites. The procedure to form
   TRILL Adjacency is specified in [RFC7173] and [RFC7177].



4.3 MPLS encapsulation for VPTS model

   The VPTS model uses PPP or Ethernet pseudowires for MPLS
   encapsulation as specified in [RFC7173], and requires no changes in
   the packet format in that RFC. In accordance with [RFC7173], the PPP
   encapsulation is the default.



4.4 Loop Free provider PSN/MPLS

   This model isn't required to employ Split Horizon mechanism in the
   provider PSN network, as TRILL takes care of Loop free topology using
   Distribution Trees. Any multi-destination packet will traverse a
   distribution tree path. All distribution trees are calculated based
   on TRILL base protocol standard [RFC6325] as updated by [RFC7780].

4.5. Frame Processing

   This section specifies multi-destination and unicast frame processing
   in VPTS/TIR model.



4.5.1 Multi-Destination Frame Processing

   Any multi-destination (unknown unicast, multicast or broadcast, as
   indicated by multi-destination bit in the TRILL Header) packets
   inside a VTSD will be processed or forwarded through the distribution
   tree for which they were encapsulated on TRILL ingress. If any multi-
   destination packet is received from the wrong pseudowire at a VTSD,
   the TRILL protocol running in the VTSD will perform an RPF check as
   specified in [RFC7780] and drop the packet.

   The Pruning mechanism in Distribution Trees, as specified in
   [RFC6325] and [RFC7780], can also be used to avoid forwarding of
   multi-destination data packets on the branches where there are no
   potential destinations.



4.5.2 Unicast Frame Processing

   Unicast packets are forwarded in same way they get forwarded in a
   standard TRILL Campus as specified in [RFC6325]. If multiple equal
   cost paths are available over pseudowires to reach destination, then
   VTSD should be capable of doing ECMP for them.

5. VPTS Model Versus VPLS Model

   VPLS Model uses a simpler loop-breaking rule: the "split horizon"
   rule, where a PE must not forward traffic from one PW to another in
   the same VPLS mesh, whereas the VPTS Model uses distribution Trees
   for loop free topology. As this is an emulated TRILL service, for
   interoperability purposes the VPTS model is the default.




6. Packet Processing Between Pseudowires

   Whenever a packet gets received over a pseudowire, a VTSD will
   decapsulate the MPLS headers followed by checking the TRILL header.
   If the egress nickname in the TRILL header is for a TRILL site
   located beyond another pseudowire, then VTSD will encapsulate with
   new MPLS headers and send it across the proper pseudowire.

   For example in figure 3, consider that the pseudowire between TIR1
   and TIR2 fails, Then TIR1 will communicate with TIR2 via TIR3,
   whenever packets which are destined to TIR3 gets received from
   pseudowire between TIR1 and TIR3, VTSD inside TIR3 will decapsulate

   the MPLS headers, then check the TRILL header's egress nickname
   field. If the egress nickname indicate it is destained for the
   RBridge in site3 then the packet will be sent to RBc, if the egress
   nickname is located at site2, VTSD will add MPLS headers for the
   pseudowire between TIR3 and TIR2 and forward the packet on that
   pseudowire.

7. Efficiency Considerations

   Since the VPTS Model uses Distribution trees for processing of multi-
   destination data packets, it is always advisable to have at least one
   Distribution tree root to be located in every TRILL site. This will
   avoid data packets getting received at TRILL sites where end-station
   service is not enabled for that data packet.



8. Security Considerations

   This document specifies methods using existing standards and
   facilities in ways that do not create new security problems.

   For general VPLS security considerations, including discussion of
   isolating customers from each other, see [RFC4761] and [RFC4762].

   For transport of TRILL by Pseudowires security consideration, see
   [RFC7173]. In particular, since pseudowires are support by MPLS or IP
   which are in turn supported by a link layer, that document recommends
   using IP security, such as IPsec [RFC4301] or DTLS [RFC6347], or the
   lower link layer security, such as MACSEC [802.1AE] for Ethernet
   links.

   Transmission outside the customer environment through the provider
   environment, as described in this document, increases risk of
   compromise or injection of false data through failure of tenant
   isolation or by the provider. In the VPLS model (Section 3), the use
   of link encryption and authentication between the CEs of a tenant
   that is being connected through provider facilities should be a good
   defense. In the VPTS model (Section 4), it is assumed that the CEs
   will peer with virtual TRILL switches of the provider network and
   thus link security between TRILL switch ports is inadequate as it
   will terminate at the edge PE. Thus, end station to end station
   encryption and authentication is more appropriate for the VPTS model.

   For added security against the compromise of data end-to-end
   encryption and authentication should be considered; that is,
   encryption and authentication from source end station to destination
   end station. This would typically be provided by IPsec [RFC4301] or
   DTLS [RFC6347] or other protocols convenient to protect information
   of concern.

   For general TRILL security considerations, see [RFC6325].
