Abstract

This document provides a high level overview of the capabilities
supported by the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (RFC2960).
It is intended as a guide for potential users of  
SCTP as a general purpose transport protocol.

1. Introduction

The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a new IP 
transport protocol, existing at an equivalent level with UDP (User 
Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which 
currently provide transport layer functions to many 
Internet applications.  SCTP has been approved by the IETF as a 
Proposed Standard, and is specified in RFC2960.

Like TCP, SCTP provides a reliable transport service, ensuring 
that data is transported across the network without error and in 
sequence.  Like TCP, SCTP is a session-oriented mechanism, meaning 
that a relationship is created between the endpoints of an SCTP 
association prior to data being transmitted, and this relationship 
is maintained until all data transmission has been successfully 
completed.

Unlike TCP, SCTP provides a number of functions that are 
critical for telephony signaling transport, and at the same 
time can potentially benefit other applications needing

transport with additional performance and reliability. 

2. Basic SCTP Features

SCTP is a unicast protocol, and supports data exchange between 
exactly 2 endpoints, although these may be represented by multiple 
IP addresses.

SCTP provides reliable transmission, detecting when data is 
discarded, reordered, duplicated or corrupted, and retransmitting 
damaged data as necessary.  SCTP transmission is full duplex.

SCTP is message oriented and supports framing of individual 
message boundaries.  In comparison, TCP is byte oriented and does 
not preserve any implicit structure within a transmitted byte 
stream without enhancement.

SCTP is rate adaptive similar to TCP, and will scale back data 
transfer to the prevailing load conditions in the network.  It is 
designed to behave cooperatively with TCP sessions attempting to 
use the same bandwidth.

3. SCTP Multi-Streaming Feature

The name Stream Control Transmission Protocol is derived from the 
multi-streaming function provided by SCTP.  This feature allows 
data to be partitioned into multiple streams that have the 
property of independently sequenced delivery, so that message loss 
in any of the streams will only affect delivery within that 
stream, and not in other streams.

In contrast, TCP provides a single stream of data and ensures that 
delivery of that stream takes place with byte sequence 
preservation.  While this is desirable for delivery of a file or 
record, it causes additional delay when message loss or sequence 
error occurs within the network.  When this happens, TCP must 
delay delivery of data until the correct sequencing is restored, 
either by receipt of an out-of-sequence message, or by 
retransmission of a lost message.

For a number of applications, this characteristic of strict 
sequence preservation is not truly necessary.  In telephony signaling,
it is only necessary to maintain sequencing of messages 
that affect the same resource (e.g., the same call, or the same 
channel).  Other messages are only loosely correlated and can be 
delivered without having to maintain overall sequence integrity.

Another example of possible use of multi-streaming is delivery of 
multimedia documents such as a web page, when done over a single
session.  Studies suggest that since multimedia objects 
contained in the document will have different sizes and

types affecting their delivery time and importance to the
viewer, transport may be improved by adding the ability
to deliver objects out of sequence or partially ordered, 
rather than in perfect order, especially in the presence of 
network message loss that may affect presentation of an individual 
object.  By using multiple streams, partial ordering of 
delivery is possible within one session.

Note that all streams within a single SCTP association are subject 
to a common flow and congestion control mechanism.  Future 
enhancements to the protocol will include per-stream flow control.

SCTP accomplishes multi-streaming by creating independence between 
data transmission and data delivery.  In particular, each DATA 
"chunk" (or PDU) in the protocol uses two sets of sequence 
numbers, a Transmission Sequence Number that governs the 
transmission of messages and the detection of message loss, and 
the Stream ID/Stream Sequence Number pair, which is used to 
determine the sequence of delivery of received data.

This independence of mechanisms allows the receiver to determine 
immediately when a gap in the transmission sequence occurs (e.g., 
due to message loss), and also whether or not messages received 
following the gap are within an affected stream.  If a message is 
received within the affected stream, there will be a corresponding 
gap in the Stream Sequence Number, while messages from other 
streams will not show a gap.  The receiver can therefore continue 
to deliver messages to the unaffected streams while buffering 
messages in the affected stream until retransmission occurs.

3. SCTP Multi-Homing Feature

Another core feature of SCTP is multi-homing, or the ability for 
a single SCTP endpoint to support multiple IP addresses.  The 
benefit of multi-homing is potentially greater survivability of 
the session in the presence of network failures.  In a 
conventional single-homed session, the failure of a local LAN 
access can isolate the end system, while failures within the core 
network can cause temporary unavailability of transport until the 
IP routing protocols can reconverge around the point of failure.  
Using multi-homed SCTP, redundant LANs can be used to reinforce 
the local access, while various options are possible in the core 
network to reduce the dependency of failures for different 
addresses.  Use of addresses with different prefixes can force 
routing to go through different carriers, for example, while 
route-pinning techniques or even redundant core networks can also 
be used if there is control over the network architecture and 
protocols.

In its current form, SCTP does not do load-sharing, that is, 
multi-homing is used for redundancy purposes only.  A single 
address is chosen as the "primary" address and is used as the 
destination for all DATA chunks for normal transmission.  
Retransmitted DATA chunks use the alternate address(es) to improve 
the probability of reaching the remote endpoint, while continued 
failure to send to the primary address ultimately results in the 
decision to transmit all DATA chunks to the alternate until 
heartbeats can reestablish the reachability of the primary.

To support multi-homing, SCTP endpoints exchange lists of 
addresses during initiation of the association.  Each endpoint 
must be able to receive messages from any of the addresses 
associated with the remote endpoint; in practice, certain 
operating systems will utilize available source addresses in round 
robin fashion, in which case receipt of messages from different 
source addresses will be the normal case.  A single port number is 
used across the entire address list at an endpoint for a specific 
session.

In order to reduce the potential for security issues, it is 
required that some response messages be sent specifically to the 
source address in the message that caused the response.  For 
example, when the server receives an INIT chunk from a client to 
initiate an SCTP association, the server always sends the response 
INIT ACK chunk to the source address that was in the IP header of 
the INIT.

5. Features of the SCTP Initiation Procedure

The SCTP Initiation Procedure relies on a 4 message sequence, 
where DATA can be included on the 3rd and 4th messages of the 
sequence, as these messages are sent when the association has 
already been validated.  A "cookie" mechanism has been 
incorporated into the sequence to guard against some types of 
denial of service attacks.

5.1 Cookie Mechanism

The "cookie" mechanism guards specifically against a blind 
attacker generating false INIT chunks to try to overload the 
resources of an SCTP server by causing it to use up memory 
and resources handling new INIT requests.  Rather than allocating 
memory for a Transmission Control Block (TCB), the server instead 
encrypts enough information to build its TCB an internal key and 
sends this as a Cookie parameter in the INIT ACK.  Since the INIT 
ACK always goes back to the source address of the INIT, the blind 
attacker will not get the Cookie.  A valid SCTP client will get 
the Cookie and return it in the COOKIE ECHO chunk, where the SCTP 



Ong                draft-ong-sigtran-sctpover-00.txt      [Page 4]
Internet Draft               SCTP Overview                Jan 2001

server can decrypt the Cookie and verify that it is valid - note 
that the SCTP client never has to understand the Cookie, so that 
no exchange of keys is required.

Otherwise, the SCTP Initiation Procedure follows many TCP 
conventions, so that the endpoints exchange receiver windows, 
initial sequence numbers, etc.  In addition to this, the endpoints 
may exchange address lists as discussed above, and also mutually 
confirm the number of streams to be opened on each side.

5.2 INIT Collision Resolution

Multi-homing adds to the potential that messages will be received 
out of sequence or with different address pairs.  This is a 
particular concern during initiation of the association, where 
without procedures for resolving collision of messages, you may 
easily end up with multiple parallel associations between the 
same endpoints.  To avoid this, SCTP incorporates a number of 
procedures to resolve parallel initiation attempts into a single 
association. 

6. SCTP DATA Exchange Features

DATA chunk exchange in SCTP follows TCP's Selective ACK procedure.  
Receipt of DATA chunks is acknowledged by sending SACK chunks, 
which indicate not only the cumulative Transmission Sequence 
Number (TSN) range received, but also any non-cumulative TSNs, 
implying gaps in the received TSN sequence.  Following TCP 
procedures, SACKs are sent using the "delayed ack" method, 
normally one SACK per every other received packet, but with an 
upper limit on the delay between SACKs and an increase to once per 
received packet when there are gaps detected.

Flow and Congestion Control follow TCP algorithms.  The advertised 
receive window indicates buffer occupancy at the receiver, while a 
per-path congestion window is maintained to manage the packets in 
flight.  Slow start, Congestion avoidance, Fast recovery and Fast 
retransmit are incorporated into the procedures as described in 
RFC2581, with the one change being that the endpoints must manage 
the conversion between bytes sent and received and TSNs sent and 
received, since TSN is per chunk rather than per byte.

The application can specify a lifetime for data to be transmitted, 
so that if the lifetime has expired and the data has not yet been 
transmitted, it can be discarded (e.g., time-sensitive signaling 
messages).  If the data has been transmitted, it must continue to 
be delivered to avoid creating a hole in the TSN sequence.

7. SCTP Shutdown Features

SCTP Shutdown uses a 3 message procedure to allow graceful 
shutdown, where each endpoint has confirmation of the DATA chunks 
received by the remote endpoint prior to completion of the 

Ong                draft-ong-sigtran-sctpover-00.txt      [Page 5]
Internet Draft               SCTP Overview                Jan 2001

shutdown.  An Abort procedure is also provided for error cases 
when an immediate shutdown must take place.

Note that SCTP does not support the function of a "half-open" 
connection as can occur in TCP, when one side indicates that it 
has no more data to send, but the other side can continue to send 
data indefinitely.  SCTP assumes that once the shutdown procedure 
begins, both sides will stop sending new data across the 
association, and only need to clear up acknowledgements of 
previously sent data.

8. SCTP Message Format

The SCTP Message includes a common header plus one or more chunks, 
which can be control or data.  The common header has source and 
destination port numbers to allow multiplexing of different SCTP 
associations at the same address, a 32-bit verification tag that 
guards against insertion of an out-of-date or false message into 
the SCTP association, and a 32-bit checksum (the Adler checksum, 
described in RFC1950) for end-to-end error detection.

Each chunk includes chunk type, flag field, length and value.  
Control chunks incorporate different flags and parameters 
depending on the chunk type.  DATA chunks in particular 
incorporate flags for control of segmentation and reassembly, and 
parameters for the TSN, Stream ID and Stream Sequence Number, and 
a Payload Protocol Identifier.

The Payload Protocol ID has been included for future flexibility. 
Initially, values will reflect the adaptation layer protocol 
running over SCTP, and will match the registered port number 
assignments for adaptation layers.  In future, it is envisioned 
that the functions of protocol identification and port number 
multiplexing will not be as closely linked so that the port number 
significance is not so much overloaded as it is now.

The SCTP message format naturally allows support of bundling of 
multiple DATA and control chunks in a single message, to improve 
transport efficiency.  Use of bundling is controllable by the 
application, so that bundling of initial transmission can be 
prohibited.  Bundling will naturally occur on retransmission of 
DATA chunks, to further reduce any chance of congestion. 

9. Error Handling 

9.1 Retransmission

Retransmission of DATA chunks occurs from either (a) timeout of 
the retransmission timer; or (b) receipt of SACKs indicating the 
DATA chunk has not been received.  To reduce the potential for 
congestion, the rate of retransmission of DATA chunks is limited.  
The retransmission timeout (RTO) is adjusted based on estimates of 


Ong                draft-ong-sigtran-sctpover-00.txt      [Page 6]
Internet Draft               SCTP Overview                Jan 2001

the round trip delay and backs off exponentially as message loss 
increases.  

In an active association with fairly constant DATA transmission, 
SACKs are more likely to cause retransmission than the timeout.  
To reduce the chance of an unnecessary retransmission, a 4 SACK 
rule is used, so that retransmission only occurs on receipt of the 
4th SACK that indicates that the chunk is missing.  This is 
intended to avoid retransmits due to normal occurrences such as 
packets received out of sequence. 

9.2 Path Failure

A count is maintained of the number of retransmissions to a 
particular destination address without successful acknowledgement.  
When this count exceeds a configured maximum, the address is 
declared inactive, notification is given to the application, and 
the SCTP begins to use an alternate address for sending of DATA 
chunks.

Also, Heartbeat chunks are sent periodically to all idle 
destinations (i.e., alternate addresses), and a counter is 
maintained on the number of Heartbeats sent to an inactive 
destination without receipt of a corresponding Heartbeat Ack.  
When this counter exceeds a configured maximum, that destination 
address is also declared inactive.

Heartbeats continue to be sent to inactive destination addresses 
until an Ack is received, at which point the address can be made 
active again.  The rate of sending of Heartbeats is tied to the 
RTO estimation plus an additional delay, to allow Heartbeat 
traffic to be tailored to the needs of transmitted between 
administrative domains in accordance with the application.  

9.3 Endpoint Failure

A count is maintained across all destination addresses on the 
number of retransmits or Heartbeats send to the remote endpoint 
without successful Ack.  When this exceeds a configured maximum, 
the endpoint is delared unreachable, and the SCTP association is 
closed. 

10. API

The specification includes a model of the primitives exchanged 
between the application and the SCTP layer, intended as 
informational material rather than a formal API statement.  A 
socket-based API is being defined to simplify migration of TCP or 
UDP applications to the use of SCTP.

11. Security 

In addition to the verification tag and cookie mechanisms, SCTP 
specifies the use of IPSec if strong security and integrity 
protection is required.  The SCTP specification does not itself 
define any new security protocols or procedures.

Currently use of IPSec for multi-homing requires establishment of 
separate Security Associations between each pair of communicating 
addresses, which adds significant overhead if the SCTP endpoint 
supports many addresses.  Extensions to IPSec to reduce this 
overhead are in progress.

12. Extensions

The SCTP format allows new chunk types, flags and parameter fields 
to be defined as extensions to the protocol.  Any extensions must 
be based on standard agreements within IETF, as no vendor-specific 
extensions are supported in the protocol.

Chunk Type values are organized into four ranges to allow 
extensions to be made with a pre-defined procedure for responding 
if the a new Chunk Type is not recognized at the remote endpoint.  
Responses include: whole packet discard; packet discard with 
reporting; ignoring the chunk; ignoring with reporting.  Similar 
pre-defined responses are specified for unrecognized Parameter 
Type values.

Chunk Parameter Type values are in principle independent ranges 
for each Chunk Type.  In practice, the values defined in the SCTP 
specification have been coordinated so that a particular parameter 
type will have the same Chunk Parameter Type value across all 
Chunk Types.  Further experience will determine if this alignment 
needs to be maintained or formalized.
