Abstract

   This document is intended to provide information to members of the
   IETF Home Networks Working Group (HOMENET WG), so that we can make an
   informed decision regarding which routing protocol to use in home
   networks.  The routing protocols compared in this document are: The
   Babel Routing Protocol (Babel) and The Intermediate System to
   Intermediate System Intra-Domain Routing Protocol (IS-IS).

1.  Introduction

   This document compares IS-IS (ISO/IEC 10589:2002) [RFC1142] and Babel
   [RFC6126] according to several criteria related to their use in home
   networks (HOMENETs), as defined by the HOMENET WG.

   Please note that this document does not represent the consenus of any
   group, not even the authors.  It is an organized collection of facts
   and well-informed opinions provided by experts on Babel and IS-IS
   that may be useful to the HOMENET WG in choosing a routing protocol.

   The HOMENET environment is different from the environment of a
   professionally administered network.  The most obvious difference is
   that a HOMENET is not administered: any protocols used must be robust
   and fully self-configuring, and any tuning knobs that they provide
   will be unused in the vast majority of deployments.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   Another difference is that HOMENETs are usually built out of a
   specific class of cheap device, the "Plastic Home Router".  A Plastic
   Home Router's firmware is installed at the factory, and is most
   likely never updated.  Additionally, experience shows that home
   routers are often used way beyond their warranty period, and even
   after their manufacturer leaves the router business.  This, again,
   argues in favour of simple, robust protocols that are easy to
   implement and can be expected to keep functioning without software
   updates.

   HOMENETs are built and grow organically, and often end up consisting
   of multiple link technologies with widely different performance
   characteristics (twisted-pair Ethernet, IEEE 802.11 and its multiple
   variants, Powerline Ethernet, etc.).  It is desirable for a HOMENET
   routing protocol to be able to dynamically optimise paths according
   to the link characteristics.

   Contrary to popular perception, the Plastic Home Router is usually
   equipped with a reasonably fast CPU and reasonable amounts of flash
   and RAM; at the time of writing, a (non-superscalar) 700MHz MIPS CPU
   with 16MB of flash and 64MB of RAM is typical.  However, we expect
   smaller devices to participate in the HOMENET protocols, at least as
   stub routers.  The ability to scale down the HOMENET protocols is
   therefore likely to encourage their wider adoption.

   [Isn't it also the case that the HOMENET routing protocol will be
   implemented on lower-end embedded devices, such as nodes in a low-
   power wireless network?  What is considered to be a reasonable low-
   end system requirement for a HOMENET router? -- mrw]

   Experts appear to disagree on the expected size of a HOMENET; we have
   heard estimates ranging from just one router up to 250 routers.  In
   any case, while scaling beyond a few thousand nodes is not likely to
   be relevant to HOMENET in the foreseeable future, the HOMENET
   protocols, if successful, will be repurposed to larger networks,
   whether we like it or not, and using a protocol that scales well from
   the outset may be desirable.

2.  Protocols and Extensions Included in Comparison

   Both IS-IS and Babel are living protocols that are updated and
   extended over time.  This section lists the extensions that were
   considered in this comparison.  Additional protocol extensions could
   affect some of the information included in this document.

2.1.  IS-IS Protocol and Extensions

   In addition to the base IS-IS protocol specification (ISO/IEC
   10589:2002), this comparison considers the following IS-IS
   extensions:

   o  ISIS Auto-Configuration [ISIS-AUTOCONF];

   o  Source-Specific routing in IS-IS [ISIS-SS].

2.2.  Babel Protocol and Extensions

   In addition to the base Babel Protocol specification (RFC 6126), this
   comparison considers the following Babel extensions:

   o  Extension Mechanism for the Babel Routing Protocol [BABEL-EXT];

   o  Source-Specific Routing [BABEL-SS], described in more detail in
      [SS-ROUTING].

3.  Routing Algorithms

   IS-IS is a Link State routing protocol, and Babel is a Loop-Avoiding
   Distance Vector routing protocol.  There are some differences between
   these algorithms, particularly in terms of scalability, how much
   information is exchanged when the routing topology changes, and how
   far topology changes are propagated.

3.1.  Link State Algorithm

   Link state algorithms distribute information for each node to all
   other nodes in the network using a flooding algorithm.  This database
   of information is then used by each node to compute the best path to
   the other nodes in the network.

   One benefit of this algorithm is that each node contains the full
   knowledge of the topology of the network.  This information can be
   used by other applications outside the routing protocol itself.

   Additionally the flooding algorithm has been found as an efficient
   method for other applications to distribute node-specific application
   data, although some care must be taken with this use so as not to
   disrupt the fundamental routing function.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


3.2.  Loop-Avoiding Distance-Vector Algorithm (Babel)

   Distance-vector algorithms distribute information about the path
   length to reach each destination through a given neighbor.  Packets
   are forwarded to the neighbor who is advertising the best path
   towards the destination.

   Babel, like EIGRP, DSDV, and to a certain extent BGP, uses a loop-
   avoiding distance-vector algorithm: it avoids creating a loop even
   during reconvergence (there is no "counting to infinity", and even
   short-lived "microloops" are avoided in most cases).

3.3.  Algorithm Comparison

   Loop-Avoiding Distance Vector scales to very large networks -- the
   amount of state is linear in the number of nodes, and, due to the
   absence of pathologies during reconvergence, does not need to be
   propagated in a timely manner.  It scales badly in extremely dense
   deployments, where a single node has thousands of direct neighbours;
   such deployments are unlikely, and clearly outside the scope of
   HOMENET.

   Link state algorithms scales to very large, very dense networks.

   IS-IS distributes link and prefix information for each node in a
   single Logical LSP (possibly fragmented).  It uses these LSPs to
   compute a tree representing the entire network.  There is no
   duplication of state based on the number of adjacencies or unique
   paths to a given prefix.

4.  Convergence Times

   Convergence time is defined as the amount of time after a link
   failure is detected during which the network is not fully
   operational.  It does not include the time necessary to detect a link
   failure.

4.1.  IS-IS

   Given fast flooding of any change in the network, IS-IS has been
   shown to acheive sub 200ms end-to-end convergence even in very large
   provider networks (single area 900+ nodes).  Basically the time for
   convergence is the time to propagate a new LSP from one end of the
   network to the other plus the SPF (tree computation interval) and FIB
   loading time.  The flooding is done without delay and prior to
   running the SPF (tree-calculation) algorithm.  Thus is roughly
   proportional to propagation delay across the diameter of the network.
   The tree calculation is sub 20ms on modern CPUs.  FIB load time

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   depends on the FIB hardware and design and not the routing protocol
   choice.

   We easily should expect sub-second convergence for any change in
   reachability (addition or subtraction) in any conceivable homenet
   deployment.

4.2.  Babel

   Since Babel maintains a redundant routing table, it is most often
   able to reconverge almost instantaneously after a link failure (this
   is similar to e.g.  EIGRP).  In the case where no feasible routes are
   available, Babel reconverges in 20ms per hop to the source.

4.3.  Discussion

   Both protocols enjoy fast convergence.  However, unless there is a
   high level of integration between the routing protocol and the link
   layer, the time needed to reconverge is dwarfed by the amount of time
   needed to detect a link failure, which is the hold time in IS-IS (30s
   by default), and two hello intervals on Babel wired links (8s by
   default).  (Babel performs link quality estimation on wireless links,
   so the delay is somewhat more difficult to quantify there.)

5.  Autoconfiguration

   Home networks are not administered, so a routing protocol needs to be
   entirely self-configuring in order to be suitable for HOMENETs.

5.1.  IS-IS

   The only required configuration for IS-IS is a unique area/system
   identifier.  The HOMENET implementation of IS-IS uses an
   autoconfiguration extension defined in an Internet Draft
   [ISIS-AUTOCONF], to set this value.

5.2.  Babel

   Babel is a fully self-configuring protocol -- the standard
   implementation of Babel only requires a list of interfaces in order
   to start routing.

5.3.  Discussion

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


6.  Support for Source-Specific Routing

   Source-Specific Routing is a hard requirement for HOMENETs, as it
   will allow traffic to be routed to the correct outbound network based
   on host source address selection.  Routing packets to the wrong
   outbound network could result in packets being dropped due to ISP
   ingress filtering rules.

   Both Babel and IS-IS have extensions for source-specific routing.

6.1.  Source-Specific Routing in IS-IS

   IS-IS support for source specific routing is implemented with the
   addition of a sub-TLV to a reachability (prefix) TLV.  The
   implementation assumes that all IS-IS routers have support for the
   sub-TLV.  This assumption is safe to make due to the requirement that
   all homenet IS-IS routers also use a homenet specific area ID and
   cleartext password.  Mixing in IS-IS routers without support for
   source specific routing is not supported as it may cause routing
   loops.

6.2.  Source-Specific Routing in Babel

   The Source-specific extension to the Babel routing protocol
   [BABEL-SS] has been implemented for over a year, has been made widely
   available and has seen a fair amount deployment as part of OpenWRT
   and CeroWRT.  The source-specific code is currently in the process of
   being merged into the standard Babel implementation, and is scheduled
   to be included in version 1.6 (planned for March 2015).

   Babel's source-specific extensions were carefully designed so that
   source-specific and ordinary (non-specific) routers can coexist in a
   single routing domain, without causing routing loops.  However,
   unless there is a connected backbone of source-specific routers, any
   non-specific routers present in the HOMENET may experience
   blackholes.  Interoperability between plain Babel and Source-Specific
   Babel is described in detail in Section VI.A of [SS-ROUTING].

6.3.  Discussion

7.  Support for Link Metrics

   Typical HOMENETs are built out of multiple link technologies with
   very different performance characteristics -- Gigabit Ethernet can
   easily have three orders of magnitude higher throughput than a
   marginal wireless link.  Both IS-IS and Babel quantify the
   desirability of a link by assigning a metric to it.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


7.1.  Link Metrics in IS-IS

   The HOMENET implementation of IS-IS uses the wide-metric (24-bit)
   link metric.  Additionally IS-IS includes multi-topology support
   allowing for a variable number of metrics per link, as well as per-
   link and per-prefix tags allowing for coloring of links and
   reachability, and finally per-link and per-prefix sub-tlv's allowing
   for any future additional extensions.

7.2.  Link Metrics in Babel

   Since Babel was originally designed for heterogeneous networks, it is
   able to dynamically assign metrics to links depending on their lower-
   layer characteristics.  In practice, Babel assigns lower (better)
   metrics to wired links than to wireless ones, dynamically measures
   loss rates in order to favour lossless wireless links, favours routes
   with non-interfering radio frequencies, and avoids high-latency
   tunnels.

   Obviously, such a wealth of information can lead to contradictory
   data in edge cases; however, Babel's loop-avoidance mechanisms ensure
   that the network remains in a consistent state in all cases, and a
   hysteresis mechanism ensures that, should a feedback loop occur, the
   frequency of oscillations remains bounded [DELAY-BASED].

8.  Support for Attached Stub Networks

   A stub network is one that is attached to a HOMENET, possibly through
   multiple HOMENET routers, but must not be used for transit.  For
   example, a stub network could be a sensor network which would
   collapse under the HOMENET traffic should it ever be used for
   transit.

   In the following example, if the dotted link between C and D is a
   stub network, then it must not be used for transit even if the link
   between A and B fails:

   ---- A ----- B -----
        |       |
        |       |
        C ..... D

8.1.  IS-IS Support for Stub Networks

   In IS-IS reachability (prefixes) and topology (links/adjacencies) are
   separate things.  IS-IS supports stub-networks as defined above
   simply by advertising the prefix associated with a link, but not the
   link itself.  This is sometimes referred to as a "passive link".

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


8.2.  Babel Support for Stub Networks

   Babel supports flexible filtering of routes, and a stub network can
   be designated by simply setting up the necessary filtering rules.
   For resource-limited deployments, a minimalistic, stub-only
   implementation of Babel is available.

9.  Security Features

   [I think this section is badly written.  We should just state whether
   each protocol supports auth or encryption, and whether it supports
   symmetric or something more exciting. -- jch]

   IS-IS offers multiple levels of security from none, to simple clear-
   text (password) authentication, to fully generic cryptographic
   authentication using any number of hashing algorithms (e.g., HMAC-
   MD5, HMAC-SHA1, ... HMAC-SHA512).  Currently, the HOMENET
   implementation of IS-IS uses the cleartext password set to a
   predefined value for auto-configuration purposes.

9.2.  Security Features in Babel

   Babel supports symmetric key authentication using an extensible HMAC-
   based cryptographic authentication mechanism [RFC7298].

10.  Support for Multicast

   Although the HOMENET WG has not yet determined whether to support
   multicast in HOMENET Networks, it might be desirable to pick a
   routing protocol that supports multicast, so that it will be easier
   to add multicast support in the future.

10.1.  Multicast Routing in IS-IS

   The IS-IS protocol supports multicast routing.  However, none of the
   available implementations include support for multicast.

10.2.  Multicast Routing in Babel

   There is no support for multicast routing in Babel.

11.  Implementation Status

   There are HOMENET implementations of both IS-IS and Babel.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   The HOMENET implementation of IS-IS is the only IS-IS implementation
   that supports source-specific routing, which is a hard requirement
   for HOMENET.  If source-specific routing is not required, there are
   several independent, interoperable proprietary implementations of IS-
   IS (all major router vendors implement IS-IS).  We are not aware of
   any production-quality open-source implementation of IS-IS other than
   the HOMENET one.

   There are multiple open source implementations of Babel, two of which
   support source-specific routing.  All implementations (except the
   stub-only version) were originally derived from the same codebase.

12.  Code and State Size

12.1.  IS-IS Code and State Size

   The HOMENET implementation of IS-IS consists of 7000 lines of Erlang
   code and has an installed size of over 11MB.  Its initial memory
   usage (as reported by the operating system) is 22MB, and its working
   set increases by XXX bytes for each new edge in the network graph.
   To put these numbers into perspective, in a network with XXX nodes
   each of which has XXX neighbours, the HOMENET implementation of IS-IS
   requires XXX bytes for its data structures.

   The code size of IS-IS depends greatly on what aspects of the
   protocol have been implemented.  IS-IS supports multiple address
   families as well as completely different protocol stacks (OSI and
   IP), multiple area hierachical operation with automatic virtual link
   support for repairing area partitions, and multiple link types.
   Additionally many other protocol features have been added over time
   to augment the protocol or replace previous behavior.  The protocol
   lends itself well to not only extension, but pairing down of
   features.

   For HOMENET we need a level-1 only implementation supporting a common
   topology for IPv4 and IPv6 over broadcast (i.e., ethernet) link
   types.  Additionally, we only require support of the latest extended
   metric TLVs (i.e., not implement legacy metric support).

   The operational state required by IS-IS is proportional to the number
   of routers, links, and prefixes in the network.  Each router in the
   network generates and advertises a Link State Protocol Data Unit
   (LSP) that describes it's attached links and prefixes.  A copy of
   each of these LSPs is stored by each router in the network.  IS-IS
   uses these LSPs to construct a shortest-path-first (SPF) tree with
   attached prefix information from which routes to the prefixes are
   created.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   Concrete numbers lacking.

12.2.  Babel Code and State Size

   The source-specific implementation of Babel, which implements many
   non-HOMENET extensions to the protocol, consists of roughly 10000
   lines of C and has an installed size of less than 130kB on AMD-64.
   Its initial memory usage (as reported by the operating system) is
   300kB.

   The amount of state stored by a Babel router is at worst one routing
   table entry for each destination through each neighbour.  In the
   source-specific implementation, one routing entry occupies roughly
   100 bytes of memory.  To put these figures into perspective, in a
   network with 1000 nodes, a Babel router with 10 neighbours needs
   roughly a megabyte of memory to store its routing table (not counting
   malloc overhead).

   The stub-only implementation of Babel consists of 900 lines of C and
   compiles to 12kB (dynamically linked).  Its memory usage (as reported
   by the operating system) is 200kB, and remains constant (it doesn't
   perform any dynamic memory allocation).

   protocol implementations.  (Data courtesy of Steven Barth and Markus

   In this table, "Installed size" is the size reported by the package
   manager for the routing daemon's package(s) (including the 1.6MB of
   the "Beam" Erlang VM in the case of IS-IS), while "Total installed
   size" is the sum of the size of the deamon's packages and all its
   dependencies, excluding the C library.

13.  Performance on IEEE 802.11 Wireless Networks

13.1.  IS-IS Performance on 802.11

   IS-IS is in active use in in the Internet in large non-hierachical
   (i.e., level-2 or single area level-1) deployments with hundreds of
   nodes.  The protocol has proven to be very scalable.

   [Do we have any information about the performance of IS-IS on 802.11
   networks, in particular? -- mrw]

13.2.  Babel Performance on 802.11

   Babel has been carefully optimised for 802.11 networks.  In
   particular, it performs link quality estimations of wireless links in
   a manner that works well with the 802.11 MAC.  In addition, Babel has
   provisions for estimating radio interference [BABEL-Z], which is
   essential for providing decent throughput on multi-hop radio routes.

   Babel was designed to work well on pure mesh networks (networks where
   a packet might exit through the same interface as the one it came
   from), but this is probably out of scope for HOMENET.

14.  Standardization Status

14.1.  IS-IS Standardization

   IS-IS is an ISO Standard documented in ISO/IEC 10589:2002.  There is
   an active IETF IS-IS Working Group (ISIS) that maintains and extends
   the IS-IS protocol, and the IS-IS protocol has been extended in
   several ISIS Working Group documents.

   The autoconfiguration and source-specific extensions to IS-IS, which
   are both hard requirements for HOMENET, are documented in (non-WG)
   Internet Drafts [ISIS-AUTOCONF] [ISIS-SS].

14.2.  Babel Standardization Status

   Babel is documented in an Experimental RFC (RFC 6126) published in
   2011, and it has been updated in several individual-submission RFCs
   and Internet Drafts.  An Internet Draft establishing an IANA registry

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   of Babel extensions has been submitted for publication as an RFC
   [BABEL-EXT].

   The use of Babel in a Standards Track HOMENET RFC would require a
   "downref" to non-Standards Track documents.  It would also be
   necessary to finish publishing the extensions that are needed for the
   HOMENET use case as RFCs.

15.  Evaluation of RFC 5218 Criteria

15.1.  Critical Success Factors

   Does the protocol exhibit one or more of the critical initial success
   factors as defined in RFC 5218?

15.1.1.  IS-IS Success Factors

   IS-IS exhibits the following critical initial success factors:

      Positive Net Value:

         Hardware cost: None.

         Operational interface: Existing and extensive.

         Retraining: None.

         Business dependencies: None.

      Open Specification Availability: Yes.

      Open Maintenance Processes: Yes.

      Good Technical Design: Proven with extensive deployment and

      Threats Sufficiently Mitigated: Yes.

15.1.2.  Babel Success Factos

   Babel exhibits the following critical initial success factors:

      Positive Net Value:

         Hardware cost: None.

         Operational interface: tcpdump and wireshark support, dedicated
         monitoring software.

         Retraining: None.

         Business dependencies: None.

      Incremental Deployment: Yes.

      Open Code Availability: Yes.  Multiple implementations derived
      from a common source.

      Freedom from Usage Restrictions: Yes.

      Open Specification Availability: Yes.

      Open Maintenance Processes: IANA registry in the process of being
      created.

      Good Technical Design: Yes.

      Extensible: Yes.

      No Hard Scalability bound: Yes.

      Threats Sufficiently Mitigated: probably.

15.2.  Willing Implementors

   Are there implementers who are ready to implement the technology in
   ways that are likely to be deployed?

15.2.1.  IS-IS

   There is only one implementation of autoconfiguration and source-
   specific routing for IS-IS.  There are some other open source
   implementations of the base protocol, but they are incomplete (as of
   February 2015).



Wasserman, et al.        Expires August 19, 2015               [Page 15]

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


   As all major routing vendors have (proprietary) IS-IS
   implementations, the barrier for implmeneting IS-IS for HOMENET use
   is probably manageable, assuming that the willingness to implement
   modifications needed for HOMENET use is present.

15.2.2.  Babel

   The Babel implementation is open source software (MIT licensed), and
   the codebase has proven of sufficiently high quality to be easily
   extended by people who were not in direct contact with the author
   [RFC7298].

15.3.  Willing Customers

   Are there customers (especially high-profile customers) who are ready
   to deploy the technology?

15.3.1.  IS-IS

   Yes.  IS-IS is already widely deployed in operational networks.

15.3.2.  Babel

   Source-Specific Babel is currently deployed as part of the OpenWRT
   and CeroWRT operating systems.  Additionally, the current version is
   used as a testbed for the HOMENET configuration protocol.

15.4.  Potential Niches

   Are there potential niches where the technology is compelling?

15.4.1.  IS-IS

15.4.2.  Babel

   Babel is a simple and flexible routing protocol.  Like most distance-
   vector protocols, it requires little to no configuration in most
   topologies, and has proved popular in scenarios where competent
   network administration was not available.  In addition, it has been
   shown to be particularly useful in scenarios where non-standard
   dynamically computed metrics are beneficial, notably wireless mesh
   networks and overlay networks.

15.5.  Complexity Removal

   If so, can complexity be removed to reduce cost?

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


15.5.1.  IS-IS

   As mentioned previously IS-IS can be significantly and easily pared
   down to fit the more limited scope of homenet use.  However, no such
   pared down implementation exists, and the subset of the protocol that
   needs to be implemented has never been formally defined.

15.5.2.  Babel

   Babel is a fairly simple protocol -- RFC 6126 is just 40 pages long
   (not counting informative appendices), and it has been successfully
   explained to fourth year university students in less than two hours.

   The stub-only implementation of Babel consists of 900 lines of C
   code, and has deliberately been kept as simple as possible.  We
   expect a competent engineer to get up to speed with it within hours.

15.6.  Killer App

   Is there a potential killer app?  Or can the technology work
   underneath existing unmodified applications?

15.6.1.  IS-IS

   As IS-IS already qualifies as successful (bordering on wildly) a
   killer app is not particularly relevant.

15.6.2.  Babel

   Since Babel requires virtually no configuration, it is particularly
   suitable to scenarios where a dedicated network administrator is not
   available.  Additionally, its support for dynamically computed non-
   standard metrics makes it particularly appealing in highly
   heterogeneous networks, (networks built on multiple link-layer
   technologies with widely varying performance characteristics).

15.7.  Extensible

   Is the protocol sufficiently extensible to allow potential
   deficiencies to be addressed in the future?

15.7.1.  IS-IS

   IS-IS has been shown to be incredibly extensible, originally designed
   for a completely different protocol stack (OSI) it was easily adapted
   for IP use, then to multiple address families (IPv4, IPv6) and multi-
   topology.  Indeed one of the major drivers of IS-IS's success is its
   extensibility and adaptability.

Internet-Draft     HOMENET IS-IS and Babel Comparison      February 2015


15.7.2.  Babel

   The extension mechanisms built into the Babel protocol [BABEL-EXT]
   have been shown to be a solid basis on which many backwards-
   compatible extensions have been built, including one that
   fundamentally changes the structure of announcements [BABEL-SS] and
   one that needs a non-trivial extension to the space of metrics
   [BABEL-Z].

15.8.  Success Predictable

   If it is not known whether the protocol will be successful, should
   the market decide first?  Or should the IETF work on multiple
   alternatives and let the market decide among them?  Are there factors
   listed in this document that may predict which is more likely to
   succeed?

15.8.1.  IS-IS

   For IS-IS the market has already decided that the protocol is
   successful in a fairly wide variety of deployments.  [We're speaking
   of source-specific, autoconfiguring IS-IS here?  And are we speaking
   of small, unadministered networks? -- jch]

15.8.2.  Babel

   Source-specific Babel is probably the only source-specific routing
   protocol that has seen deployment and is being used in production.

   Plain Babel has seen a modest amount of deployment, most notably for
   routing over wireless mesh networks and large-scale overlay networks.
   However, it remains a young protocol, certainly much younger than IS-
   IS.
