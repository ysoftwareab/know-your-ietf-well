           DNS Transport over TCP - Operational Requirements
                draft-ietf-dnsop-dns-tcp-requirements-08

Abstract

   This document updates [RFC1123].  This document strongly encourages
   the operational practice of permitting DNS messages to be carried
   over TCP on the Internet as a best current practice.  Such
   encouragment is aligned with the implementation requirements in RFC
   7766.  The use of TCP includes both DNS over unencrypted TCP, as well
   as over an encrypted TLS session.  The document also considers the
   consequences with this form of DNS communication and the potential
   operational issues that can arise when this best current practice is
   not upheld.

Internet-Draft           DNS Transport over TCP                 May 2021


1.  Introduction

   DNS messages are delivered using UDP or TCP communications.  While
   most DNS transactions are carried over UDP, some operators have been
   led to believe that any DNS over TCP traffic is unwanted or
   unnecessary for general DNS operation.  When DNS over TCP has been
   restricted, a variety of communication failures and debugging
   challenges often arise.  As DNS and new naming system features have
   evolved, TCP as a transport has become increasingly important for the
   correct and safe operation of an Internet DNS.  Reflecting modern
   usage, the DNS standards declare that support for TCP is a required
   part of the DNS implementation specifications [RFC7766].  This
   document is the formal requirements equivalent for the operational
   community, encouraging system administrators, network engineers, and
   security staff to ensure DNS over TCP communications support is on
   par with DNS over UDP communications.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  History of DNS over TCP

   The curious state of disagreement in operational best practices and
   guidance for DNS transport protocols derives from conflicting
   messages operators have gotten from other operators, implementors,
   and even the IETF.  Sometimes these mixed signals have been explicit,
   on other occasions they have suspiciously implicit.  This section
   presents an interpretation of the storied and conflicting history
   that led to this document.

2.1.  Uneven Transport Usage and Preference

   In the original suite of DNS specifications, [RFC1034] and [RFC1035]
   clearly specified that DNS messages could be carried in either UDP or
   TCP, but they also stated a preference for UDP as the best transport
   for queries in the general case.  As stated in [RFC1035]:

      "While virtual circuits can be used for any DNS activity,
      datagrams are preferred for queries due to their lower overhead
      and better performance."

   Another early, important, and influential document, [RFC1123], marked
   the preference for a transport protocol more explicitly:



Kristoff & Wessels      Expires November 24, 2021               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft           DNS Transport over TCP                 May 2021


      "DNS resolvers and recursive servers MUST support UDP, and SHOULD
      support TCP, for sending (non-zone-transfer) queries."

   and further stipulated:

      "A name server MAY limit the resources it devotes to TCP queries,
      but it SHOULD NOT refuse to service a TCP query just because it
      would have succeeded with UDP."

   Culminating in [RFC1536], DNS over TCP came to be associated
   primarily with the zone transfer mechanism, while most DNS queries
   and responses were seen as the dominion of UDP.

2.2.  Waiting for Large Messages and Reliability

   In the original specifications, the maximum DNS over UDP message size
   was enshrined at 512 bytes.  However, even while [RFC1123] preferred
   UDP for non-zone transfer queries, it foresaw DNS over TCP becoming
   more popular in the future to overcome this limitation:

      "[...] it is also clear that some new DNS record types defined in
      the future will contain information exceeding the 512 byte limit
      that applies to UDP, and hence will require TCP.

   At least two new, widely anticipated developments were set to elevate
   the need for DNS over TCP transactions.  The first was dynamic
   updates defined in [RFC2136] and the second was the set of extensions
   collectively known as DNSSEC, whose operational considerations are
   originally given in [RFC2541].  The former suggested "requestors who
   require an accurate response code must use TCP," while the latter
   warned "... larger keys increase the size of KEY and SIG RRs.  This
   increases the chance of DNS UDP packet overflow and the possible
   necessity for using higher overhead TCP in responses."

   Yet, defying some expectations, DNS over TCP remained little-used in
   real traffic across the Internet around this time.  Dynamic updates
   saw little deployment between autonomous networks.  Around the time
   DNSSEC was first defined, another new feature helped solidify UDP
   transport dominance for message transactions.

2.3.  EDNS(0)

   In 1999 the IETF published the Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))
   in [RFC2671] (superseded in 2013 by an update in [RFC6891]).  That
   document standardized a way for communicating DNS nodes to perform
   rudimentary capabilities negotiation.  One such capability written
   into the base specification and present in every EDNS(0)-compatible
   message is the value of the maximum UDP payload size the sender can

   support.  This unsigned 16-bit field specifies, in bytes, the maximum
   (possibly fragmented) DNS message size a node is capable of receiving
   over UDP.  In practice, typical values are a subset of the 512- to
   4096-byte range.  EDNS(0) became widely deployed over the next
   several years and numerous surveys ([CASTRO2010], [NETALYZR]) have
   shown many systems currently support larger UDP MTUs with EDNS(0).

   The natural effect of EDNS(0) deployment meant DNS messages larger
   than 512 bytes would be less reliant on TCP than they might otherwise
   have been.  While a non-negligible population of DNS systems lacked
   EDNS(0) or fell back to TCP when necessary, DNS clients still
   strongly prefer UDP to TCP.  For example, as of 2014 DNS over TCP
   transactions remained a very small fraction of overall DNS traffic
   received by root name servers [VERISIGN].

2.4.  Fragmentation and Truncation

   Although EDNS(0) provides a way for endpoints to signal support for
   DNS messages exceeding 512 bytes, the realities of a diverse and
   inconsistently deployed Internet may result in some large messages
   being unable to reach their destination.  Any IP datagram whose size
   exceeds the MTU of a link it transits will be fragmented and then
   reassembled by the receiving host.  Unfortunately, it is not uncommon
   for middleboxes and firewalls to block IP fragments.  If one or more
   fragments do not arrive, the application does not receive the message
   and the request times out.

   For IPv4-connected hosts, the MTU is often the Ethernet payload size
   of 1500 bytes.  This means that the largest unfragmented UDP DNS
   message that can be sent over IPv4 is likely 1472 bytes, although
   tunnel encapsulation may reduce that maximum message size in some
   cases.

   For IPv6, the situation is a little more complicated.  First, IPv6
   headers are 40 bytes (versus 20 without options in IPv4).  Second, it
   seems as though some people have mis-interpreted IPv6's required
   minimum MTU of 1280 as a required maximum.  Third, fragmentation in
   IPv6 can only be done by the host originating the datagram.  The need
   to fragment is conveyed in an ICMPv6 "packet too big" message.  The
   originating host indicates a fragmented datagram with IPv6 extension
   headers.  Unfortunately, it is quite common for both ICMPv6 and IPv6
   extension headers to be blocked by middleboxes.  According to
   [HUSTON] some 35% of IPv6-capable recursive resolvers were unable to
   receive a fragmented IPv6 packet.  Even if the originating host does
   receive a signal that fragmentation is required, the stateless nature
   of the DNS protocol is such that the host does not generally retain a
   copy of the message concerned and hence is unable to fragment and re-
   send anyway.

   The practical consequence of all this is that DNS requestors must be
   prepared to retry queries with different EDNS(0) maximum message size
   values.  Administrators of [BIND] are likely to be familiar with
   seeing "success resolving ... after reducing the advertised EDNS(0)
   UDP packet size to 512 octets" messages in their system logs.

   Often, reducing the EDNS(0) UDP packet size leads to a successful
   response.  That is, the necessary data fits within the smaller
   message size.  However, when the data does not fit, the server sets
   the truncated flag in its response, indicating the client should
   retry over TCP to receive the whole response.  This is undesirable
   from the client's point of view because it adds more latency and
   potentially undesirable from the server's point of view due to the
   increased resource requirements of TCP.

   The issues around fragmentation, truncation, and TCP are driving
   certain implementation and policy decisions in the DNS.  Notably,
   Cloudflare implemented what it calls "DNSSEC black lies" [CLOUDFLARE]
   and uses ECDSA algorithms, such that their signed responses fit
   easily in 512 bytes.  The KSK Rollover design team [DESIGNTEAM] spent
   a lot of time thinking and worrying about response sizes.  There is
   growing sentiment in the DNSSEC community that RSA key sizes beyond
   2048-bits are impractical and that critical infrastructure zones
   should transition to elliptic curve algorithms to keep response sizes
   manageable [ECDSA].

   More recently, renewed security concerns about fragmented DNS
   messages ([AVOID_FRAGS], [FRAG_POISON]) are leading implementors to
   consider smaller responses and lower default EDNS(0) UDP payload size
   values for both queriers and responders [FLAGDAY2020].

2.5.  "Only Zone Transfers Use TCP"

   Today, the majority of the DNS community expects, or at least has a
   desire, to see DNS over TCP transactions occur without interference.
   However there has also been a long-held belief by some operators,
   particularly for security-related reasons, that DNS over TCP services
   should be purposely limited or not provided at all [CHES94],
   [DJBDNS].  A popular meme has also held the imagination of some: that
   DNS over TCP is only ever used for zone transfers and is generally
   unnecessary otherwise, with filtering all DNS over TCP traffic even
   described as a best practice.

   The position on restricting DNS over TCP had some justification given
   that historical implementations of DNS nameservers provided very
   little in the way of TCP connection management (for example see
   Section 6.1.2 of [RFC7766] for more details).  However modern
   standards and implementations are nearing parity with the more

   sophisticated TCP management techniques employed by, for example,
   HTTP(S) servers and load balancers.

3.  DNS over TCP Requirements

   An average increase in DNS message size (e.g., due to DNSSEC), the
   continued development of new DNS features [Appendix A], and a denial
   of service mitigation technique [Section 9] show that DNS over TCP
   transactions are as important to the correct and safe operation of
   the Internet DNS as ever, if not more so.  Furthermore, there has
   been serious research that argues connection-oriented DNS
   transactions may provide security and privacy advantages over UDP
   transport.  [TDNS] In fact, the stnadard for DNS over TLS [RFC7858]
   is just this sort of specification.  Therefore, this document makes
   explicit that it is undesirable for network operators to artificially
   inhibit DNS over TCP transport.

   Section 6.1.3.2 in [RFC1123] is updated: All DNS resolvers and
   servers MUST support and service both UDP and TCP queries.

   o  Authoritative servers MUST support and service all TCP queries so
      that they do not limit the size of responses to what fits in a
      single UDP packet.

   o  Recursive servers (or forwarders) MUST support and service all TCP
      queries so that they do not prevent large responses from a TCP-
      capable server from reaching its TCP-capable clients.

   Regarding the choice of limiting the resources a server devotes to
   queries, Section 6.1.3.2 in [RFC1123] also says:

      "A name server MAY limit the resources it devotes to TCP queries,
      but it SHOULD NOT refuse to service a TCP query just because it
      would have succeeded with UDP."

   This requirement is hereby updated: A name server MAY limit the
   resources it devotes to queries, but it MUST NOT refuse to service a
   query just because it would have succeeded with another transport
   protocol.

   Filtering of DNS over TCP is harmful in the general case.  DNS
   resolver and server operators MUST support and provide DNS service
   over both UDP and TCP transports.  Likewise, network operators MUST
   allow DNS service over both UDP and TCP transports.  It is
   acknowledged that DNS over TCP service can pose operational
   challenges that are not present when running DNS over UDP alone, and
   vice-versa.  However, the potential damage incurred by prohibiting

   DNS over TCP service is more detrimental to the continued utility and
   success of the DNS than when its usage is allowed.

4.  Network and System Considerations

   This section describes measures that systems and applications can
   take to optimize performance over TCP and to protect themselves from
   TCP-based resource exhaustion and attacks.

4.1.  Connection Establishment and Admission

   Resolvers and other DNS clients should be aware that some servers
   might not be reachable over TCP.  For this reason, clients MAY want
   to track and limit the number of TCP connections and connection
   attempts to a single server.  Additionally, DNS clients MAY want to
   enforce a short timeout on unestablished connections, rather than
   rely on the host operating system's TCP connection timeout, which is
   often around 60-120 seconds.

   The SYN flooding attack is a denial-of-service method affecting hosts
   that run TCP server processes [RFC4987].  This attack can be very
   effective if not mitigated.  One of the most effective mitigation
   techniques is SYN cookies, which allows the server to avoid
   allocating any state until the successful completion of the three-way
   handshake.

   Services not intended for use by the public Internet, such as most
   recursive name servers, SHOULD be protected with access controls.
   Ideally these controls are placed in the network, well before any
   unwanted TCP packets can reach the DNS server host or application.
   If this is not possible, the controls can be placed in the
   application itself.  In some situations (e.g. attacks) it may be
   necessary to deploy access controls for DNS services that should
   otherwise be globally reachable.  See also [RFC5358].

   The FreeBSD and NetBSD operating systems have an "accept filter"
   feature ([accept_filter]) that postpones delivery of TCP connections
   to applications until a complete, valid request has been received.
   The dns_accf(9) filter ensures that a valid DNS message is received.
   If not, the bogus connection never reaches the application.  The
   Linux TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT feature, while more limited in scope, can
   provide some of the same benefits as the BSD accept filter feature.
   These features are implemented as low-level socket options, and are
   not activated automatically.  If applications wish to use these
   features, they need to make specific calls to set the right options,
   and administrators may also need to configure the applications to
   appropriately use the features.

   Per [RFC7766], applications and administrators are advised to
   remember that TCP MAY be used before sending any UDP queries.
   Networks and applications MUST NOT be configured to refuse TCP
   queries that were not preceded by a UDP query.

   TCP Fast Open [RFC7413] (TFO) allows TCP clients to shorten the
   handshake for subsequent connections to the same server.  TFO saves
   one round-trip time in the connection setup.  DNS servers SHOULD
   enable TFO when possible.  Furthermore, DNS servers clustered behind
   a single service address (e.g., anycast or load-balancing), SHOULD
   use the same TFO server key on all instances.

   DNS clients MAY also enable TFO when possible.  Currently, on some
   operating systems it is not implemented or disabled by default.
   [WIKIPEDIA_TFO] describes applications and operating systems that
   support TFO.

4.2.  Connection Management

   Since host memory for TCP state is a finite resource, DNS clients and
   servers MUST actively manage their connections.  Applications that do
   not actively manage their connections can encounter resource
   exhaustion leading to denial of service.  For DNS, as in other
   protocols, there is a tradeoff between keeping connections open for
   potential future use and the need to free up resources for new
   connections that will arrive.

   DNS server software SHOULD provide a configurable limit on the total
   number of established TCP connections.  If the limit is reached, the
   application is expected to either close existing (idle) connections
   or refuse new connections.  Operators SHOULD ensure the limit is
   configured appropriately for their particular situation.

   DNS server software MAY provide a configurable limit on the number of
   established connections per source IP address or subnet.  This can be
   used to ensure that a single or small set of users can not consume
   all TCP resources and deny service to other users.  Operators SHOULD
   ensure this limit is configured appropriately, based on their number
   of diversity of users.

   DNS server software SHOULD provide a configurable timeout for idle
   TCP connections.  For very busy name servers this might be set to a
   low value, such as a few seconds.  For less busy servers it might be
   set to a higher value, such as tens of seconds.  DNS clients and
   servers SHOULD signal their timeout values using the edns-tcp-
   keepalive option [RFC7828].

   DNS server software MAY provide a configurable limit on the number of
   transactions per TCP connection.  This document does not offer advice
   on particular values for such a limit.

   Similarly, DNS server software MAY provide a configurable limit on
   the total duration of a TCP connection.  This document does not offer
   advice on particular values for such a limit.

   Since clients may not be aware of server-imposed limits, clients
   utilizing TCP for DNS need to always be prepared to re-establish
   connections or otherwise retry outstanding queries.

4.3.  Connection Termination

   The TCP peer that initiates a connection close retains the socket in
   the TIME_WAIT state for some amount of time, possibly a few minutes.
   It is generally preferable for clients to initiate the close of a TCP
   connection so that busy servers do not accumulate many sockets in the
   TIME_WAIT state, which can cause performance problems or even denial
   of service.  The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS(0) option [RFC7828] can be
   used to encourage clients to close connections.

   On systems where large numbers of sockets in TIME_WAIT are observed
   (either as client or server), it may be beneficial to tune the local
   TCP parameters.  For example, the Linux kernel provides a number of
   "sysctl" parameters related to TIME_WAIT, such as
   net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout and net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse.  In extreme
   cases, implementors and operators of very busy servers may find it
   necessary to utilize the SO_LINGER socket option ([Stevens]
   Section 7.5) with a value of zero so that the server doesn't
   accumulate TIME_WAIT sockets.

4.4.  DNS-over-TLS

   DNS messages may be sent over TLS to provide privacy between stubs
   and recursive resolvers.  [RFC7858] is a standards track document
   describing how this works.  Although DNS-over-TLS utilizes TCP port
   853 instead of port 53, this document applies equally well to DNS-
   over-TLS.  Note, however, DNS-over-TLS is currently only defined
   between stubs and recursives.

   The use of TLS places even stronger operational burdens on DNS
   clients and servers.  Cryptographic functions for authentication and
   encryption require additional processing.  Unoptimized connection
   setup takes two additional round-trips compared to TCP, but can be
   reduced with TLS session resumption [RFC8446] and TLS False Start
   [RFC7918].

5.  DNS over TCP Filtering Risks

   Networks that filter DNS over TCP risk losing access to significant
   or important pieces of the DNS namespace.  For a variety of reasons a
   DNS answer may require a DNS over TCP query.  This may include large
   message sizes, lack of EDNS(0) support, DDoS mitigation techniques
   (including [RRL]), or perhaps some future capability that is as yet
   unforeseen will also demand TCP transport.

   For example, [RFC7901] describes a latency-avoiding technique that
   sends extra data in DNS responses.  This makes responses larger and
   potentially increases the effectiveness of DDoS reflection attacks.
   The specification mandates the use of TCP or DNS Cookies [RFC7873].

   Even if any or all particular answers have consistently been returned
   successfully with UDP in the past, this continued behavior cannot be
   guaranteed when DNS messages are exchanged between autonomous
   systems.  Therefore, filtering of DNS over TCP is considered harmful
   and contrary to the safe and successful operation of the Internet.
   This section enumerates some of the known risks known at the time of
   this writing when networks filter DNS over TCP.

5.1.  DNS Wedgie

   Networks that filter DNS over TCP may inadvertently cause problems
   for third-party resolvers as experienced by [TOYAMA].  If, for
   instance, a resolver receives a truncated answer from a server, but
   when the resolver resends the query using TCP and the TCP response
   never arrives, not only will a complete answer be unavailable, but
   the resolver will incur the full extent of TCP retransmissions and
   timeouts.  This situation might place extreme strain on resolver
   resources.  If the number and frequency of these truncated answers
   are sufficiently high, the steady-state of lost resources as a result
   is a "DNS wedgie."  A DNS wedgie is generally not easily or
   completely mitigated by the affected DNS resolver operator.

5.2.  DNS Root Zone KSK Rollover

   The plans for deploying a new root zone DNSSEC KSK highlighted a
   potential problem in retrieving the root zone key set [LEWIS].
   During some phases of the KSK rollover process, root zone DNSKEY
   responses were larger than 1280 bytes, the IPv6 minimum MTU for links
   carrying IPv6 traffic [RFC8200].  There was some concern that any DNS
   server unable to receive large DNS messages over UDP, or any DNS
   message over TCP, would experience disruption while performing DNSSEC
   validation.

Internet-Draft           DNS Transport over TCP                 May 2021


   However, during the year-long postponement of the KSK rollover there
   were no reported problems that could be attributed to the 1414 octet
   DNSKEY response when both the old and new keys were published in the
   zone.  Additionally, there were no reported problems during the two
   month period when the old key was published as revoked and the DNSKEY
   response was 1425 octets in size [ROLL_YOUR_ROOT].

6.  Logging and Monitoring

   Developers of applications that log or monitor DNS SHOULD NOT ignore
   TCP due to the perception that it is rarely used or is hard to
   process.  Operators SHOULD ensure that their monitoring and logging
   applications properly capture DNS message over TCP.  Otherwise,
   attacks, exfiltration attempts, and normal traffic may go undetected.

   DNS messages over TCP are in no way guaranteed to arrive in single
   segments.  In fact, a clever attacker might attempt to hide certain
   messages by forcing them over very small TCP segments.  Applications
   that capture network packets (e.g., with libpcap [libpcap]) SHOULD be
   prepared to implement and perform full TCP segment reassembly.
   dnscap [dnscap] is an open-source example of a DNS logging program
   that implements TCP reassembly.

   Developers SHOULD also keep in mind connection reuse, query
   pipelining, and out-of-order responses when building and testing DNS
   monitoring applications.

   As an alternative to packet capture, some DNS server software
   supports dnstap [dnstap] as an integrated monitoring protocol
   intended to facilitate wide-scale DNS monitoring.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

9.  Security Considerations

   Ironically, returning truncated DNS over UDP answers in order to
   induce a client query to switch to DNS over TCP has become a common
   response to source address spoofed, DNS denial-of-service attacks
   [RRL].  Historically, operators have been wary of TCP-based attacks,
   but in recent years, UDP-based flooding attacks have proven to be the
   most common protocol attack on the DNS.  Nevertheless, a high rate of
   short-lived DNS transactions over TCP may pose challenges.  While
   many operators have provided DNS over TCP service for many years
   without duress, past experience is no guarantee of future success.

   DNS over TCP is similar to many other Internet TCP services.  TCP
   threats and many mitigation strategies have been well-documented in a
   series of documents such as [RFC4953], [RFC4987], [RFC5927], and
   [RFC5961].

10.  Privacy Considerations

   Since DNS over both UDP and TCP use the same underlying message
   format, the use of one transport instead of the other does not change
   the privacy characteristics of the message content (i.e., the name
   being queried).  DNS over TLS or DTLS is the recommended way to
   achieve DNS privacy.

   Because TCP is somewhat more complex than UDP, some characteristics
   of a TCP conversation may enable fingerprinting and tracking that is
   not possible with UDP.  For example, the choice of initial sequence
   numbers, window size, and options might be able to identify a
   particular TCP implementation, or even individual hosts behind shared
   resources such as network address translators (NATs).

Appendix A.  Standards Related to DNS Transport over TCP

   This section enumerates all known IETF RFC documents that are
   currently of status standard, informational, best current practice,
   or experimental and either implicitly or explicitly make assumptions
   or statements about the use of TCP as a transport for the DNS germane
   to this document.

A.1.  IETF RFC 1035 - DOMAIN NAMES - IMPLEMENTATION AND SPECIFICATION

   The internet standard [RFC1035] is the base DNS specification that
   explicitly defines support for DNS over TCP.

A.2.  IETF RFC 1536 - Common DNS Implementation Errors and Suggested
      Fixes

   The informational document [RFC1536] states UDP is the "chosen
   protocol for communication though TCP is used for zone transfers."
   That statement should now be considered in its historical context and
   is no longer a proper reflection of modern expectations.

A.3.  IETF RFC 1995 - Incremental Zone Transfer in DNS

   The [RFC1995] standards track document documents the use of TCP as
   the fallback transport when IXFR responses do not fit into a single
   UDP response.  As with AXFR, IXFR messages are typically delivered
   over TCP by default in practice.

A.4.  IETF RFC 1996 - A Mechanism for Prompt Notification of Zone
      Changes (DNS NOTIFY)

   The [RFC1996] standards track document suggests a master server may
   decide to issue NOTIFY messages over TCP.  In practice, NOTIFY
   messages are generally sent over UDP, but this specification leaves
   open the possibility that the choice of transport protocol is up to

   the master server, and therefore a slave server ought to be able to
   operate over both UDP and TCP.

A.5.  IETF RFC 2181 - Clarifications to the DNS Specification

   The [RFC2181] standards track document includes clarifying text on
   how a client should react to the TC bit set on responses.  It is
   advised that the response should be discarded and the query resent
   using TCP.

A.6.  IETF RFC 2694 - DNS extensions to Network Address Translators
      (DNS_ALG)

   The informational document [RFC2694] enumerates considerations for
   network address translation (NAT) devices to properly handle DNS
   traffic.  This document is noteworthy in its suggestion that
   "[t]ypically, TCP is used for AXFR requests," as further evidence
   that helps explain why DNS over TCP may often have been treated very
   differently than DNS over UDP in operational networks.

A.7.  IETF RFC 3225 - Indicating Resolver Support of DNSSEC

   The [RFC3225] standards track document makes statements indicating
   DNS over TCP is "detrimental" as a result of increased traffic,
   latency, and server load.  This document is a companion to the next
   document in the RFC series expressing the requirement for EDNS(0)
   support for DNSSEC.

A.8.  IETF RFC 3326 - DNSSEC and IPv6 A6 aware server/resolver message
      size requirements

   Although updated by later DNSSEC RFCs, the standards track document
   [RFC3226] strongly argued in favor of UDP messages instead of TCP,
   largely for performance reasons.  The document declares EDNS(0) a
   requirement for DNSSEC servers and advocated packet fragmentation may
   be preferable to TCP in certain situations.

A.9.  IETF RFC 4472 - Operational Considerations and Issues with IPv6
      DNS

   This informational document [RFC4472] notes that IPv6 data may
   increase DNS responses beyond what would fit in a UDP message.
   Particularly noteworthy, perhaps less common today then when this
   document was written, it refers to implementations that truncate data
   without setting the TC bit to encourage the client to resend the
   query using TCP.

A.10.  IETF RFC 5452 - Measures for Making DNS More Resilient against
       Forged Answers

   This informational document [RFC5452] arose as public DNS systems
   began to experience widespread abuse from spoofed queries, resulting
   in amplification and reflection attacks against unwitting victims.
   One of the leading justifications for supporting DNS over TCP to
   thwart these attacks is briefly described in this document's 9.3
   Spoof Detection and Countermeasure section.

A.11.  IETF RFC 5507 - Design Choices When Expanding the DNS

   This informational document [RFC5507] was largely an attempt to
   dissuade new DNS data types from overloading the TXT resource record
   type.  In so doing it summarizes the conventional wisdom of DNS
   design and implementation practices.  The authors suggest TCP
   overhead and stateful properties pose challenges compared to UDP, and
   imply that UDP is generally preferred for performance and robustness.

A.12.  IETF RFC 5625 - DNS Proxy Implementation Guidelines

   This best current practice document [RFC5625] provides DNS proxy
   implementation guidance including the mandate that a proxy "MUST
   [...] be prepared to receive and forward queries over TCP" even
   though it suggests historically TCP transport has not been strictly
   mandatory in stub resolvers or recursive servers.

A.13.  IETF RFC 5936 - DNS Zone Transfer Protocol (AXFR)

   The [RFC5936] standards track document provides a detailed
   specification for the zone transfer protocol, as originally outlined
   in the early DNS standards.  AXFR operation is limited to TCP and not
   specified for UDP.  This document discusses TCP usage at length.

A.14.  IETF RFC 7534 - AS112 Nameserver Operations

   [RFC7534] is an informational document enumerating the requirements
   for operation of AS112 project DNS servers.  New AS112 nodes are
   tested for their ability to provide service on both UDP and TCP
   transports, with the implication that TCP service is an expected part
   of normal operations.

A.15.  IETF RFC 6762 - Multicast DNS

   In this standards track document [RFC6762], the TC bit is deemed to
   have essentially the same meaning as described in the original DNS
   specifications.  That is, if a response with the TC bit set is

   received, "[...] the querier SHOULD reissue its query using TCP in
   order to receive the larger response."

A.16.  IETF RFC 6891 - Extension Mechanisms for DNS (EDNS(0))

   This standards track document [RFC6891] helped slow the use of and
   need for DNS over TCP messages.  This document highlights concerns
   over server load and scalability in widespread use of DNS over TCP.

A.17.  IETF RFC 6950 - Architectural Considerations on Application
       Features in the DNS

   An informational document [RFC6950] that draws attention to large
   data in the DNS.  TCP is referenced in the context as a common
   fallback mechanism and counter to some spoofing attacks.

A.18.  IETF RFC 7477 - Child-to-Parent Synchronization in DNS

   This standards track document [RFC7477] specifies a RRType and
   protocol to signal and synchronize NS, A, and AAAA resource record
   changes from a child to parent zone.  Since this protocol may require
   multiple requests and responses, it recommends utilizing DNS over TCP
   to ensure the conversation takes place between a consistent pair of
   end nodes.

A.19.  IETF RFC 7720 - DNS Root Name Service Protocol and Deployment
       Requirements

   This best current practice [RFC7720] declares root name service "MUST
   support UDP [RFC0768] and TCP [RFC0793] transport of DNS queries and
   responses."

A.20.  IETF RFC 7766 - DNS Transport over TCP - Implementation
       Requirements

   This standards track document [RFC7766] instructs DNS implementers to
   provide support for carrying DNS over TCP messages in their software,
   and might be considered the direct ancestor of this operational
   requirements document.  The implementation requirements document
   codifies mandatory support for DNS over TCP in compliant DNS
   software, but makes no recommendations to operators, which we seek to
   address here.

A.21.  IETF RFC 7828 - The edns-tcp-keepalive EDNS(0) Option

   This standards track document [RFC7828] defines an EDNS(0) option to
   negotiate an idle timeout value for long-lived DNS over TCP
   connections.  Consequently, this document is only applicable and

   relevant to DNS over TCP sessions and between implementations that
   support this option.

A.22.  IETF RFC 7858 - Specification for DNS over Transport Layer
       Security (TLS)

   This standards track document [RFC7858] defines a method for putting
   DNS messages into a TCP-based encrypted channel using TLS.  This
   specification is noteworthy for explicitly targeting the stub-to-
   recursive traffic, but does not preclude its application from
   recursive-to-authoritative traffic.

A.23.  IETF RFC 7873 - Domain Name System (DNS) Cookies

   This standards track document [RFC7873] describes an EDNS(0) option
   to provide additional protection against query and answer forgery.
   This specification mentions DNS over TCP as an alternative mechanism
   when DNS Cookies are not available.  The specification does make
   mention of DNS over TCP processing in two specific situations.  In
   one, when a server receives only a client cookie in a request, the
   server should consider whether the request arrived over TCP and if
   so, it should consider accepting TCP as sufficient to authenticate
   the request and respond accordingly.  In another, when a client
   receives a BADCOOKIE reply using a fresh server cookie, the client
   should retry using TCP as the transport.

A.24.  IETF RFC 7901 - CHAIN Query Requests in DNS

   This experimental specification [RFC7901] describes an EDNS(0) option
   that can be used by a security-aware validating resolver to request
   and obtain a complete DNSSEC validation path for any single query.
   This document requires the use of DNS over TCP or a source IP address
   verified transport mechanism such as EDNS-COOKIE [RFC7873].

A.25.  IETF RFC 8027 - DNSSEC Roadblock Avoidance

   This document [RFC8027] details observed problems with DNSSEC
   deployment and mitigation techniques.  Network traffic blocking and
   restrictions, including DNS over TCP messages, are highlighted as one
   reason for DNSSEC deployment issues.  While this document suggests
   these sorts of problems are due to "non-compliant infrastructure" and
   is of type BCP, the scope of the document is limited to detection and
   mitigation techniques to avoid so-called DNSSEC roadblocks.

A.26.  IETF RFC 8094 - DNS over Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)

   This experimental specification [RFC8094] details a protocol that
   uses a datagram transport (UDP), but stipulates that "DNS clients and
   servers that implement DNS over DTLS MUST also implement DNS over TLS
   in order to provide privacy for clients that desire Strict Privacy
   [...]."  This requirement implies DNS over TCP must be supported in
   case the message size is larger than the path MTU.

A.27.  IETF RFC 8162 - Using Secure DNS to Associate Certificates with
       Domain Names for S/MIME

   This experimental specification [RFC8162] describes a technique to
   authenticate user X.509 certificates in an S/MIME system via the DNS.
   The document points out that the new experimental resource record
   types are expected to carry large payloads, resulting in the
   suggestion that "applications SHOULD use TCP -- not UDP -- to perform
   queries for the SMIMEA resource record."

A.28.  IETF RFC 8324 - DNS Privacy, Authorization, Special Uses,
       Encoding, Characters, Matching, and Root Structure: Time for
       Another Look?

   An informational document [RFC8324] that briefly discusses the common
   role and challenges of DNS over TCP throughout the history of DNS.

A.29.  IETF RFC 8467 - Padding Policies for Extension Mechanisms for DNS
       (EDNS(0))

   An experimental document [RFC8467] reminds implementers to consider
   the underlying transport protocol (e.g.  TCP) when calculating the
   padding length when artificially increasing the DNS message size with
   an EDNS(0) padding option.

A.30.  IETF RFC 8482 - Providing Minimal-Sized Responses to DNS Queries
       That Have QTYPE=ANY

   [RFC8482] is a standards-track document that describes alternative
   ways that DNS servers can respond to queries of type ANY, which are
   somtimes used to provide amplification in DDoS attacks.  The
   specification notes that responders may behave differently, depending
   on the transport.  For example, mimimal-sized responses may be used
   over UDP transport, while full responses may be given over TCP.

A.31.  IETF RFC 8483 - Yeti DNS Testbed

   This informational document [RFC8483] describes a testbed environment
   that highlights some DNS over TCP behaviors, including issues
   involving packet fragmentation and operational requirements for TCP
   stream assembly in order to conduct DNS measurement and analysis.

A.32.  IETF RFC 8484 - DNS Queries over HTTPS (DoH)

   This standards track document [RFC8484] defines a protocol for
   sending DNS queries and responses over HTTPS.  This specification
   assumes TLS and TCP for the underlying security and transport layers,
   respectively.  Self-described as a a technique that more closely
   resembles a tunneling mechanism, DoH nevertheless likely implies DNS
   over TCP in some sense, if not directly.

A.33.  IETF RFC 8490 - DNS Stateful Operations

   This standards track document [RFC8490] updates the base protocol
   specification with a new OPCODE to help manage stateful operations in
   persistent sessions, such as those that might be used by DNS over
   TCP.

A.34.  IETF RFC 8501 - Reverse DNS in IPv6 for Internet Service
       Providers

   This informational document [RFC8501] identifies potential
   operational challenges with Dynamic DNS including denial-of-service
   threats.  The document suggests TCP may provide some advantages, but
   that updating hosts would need to be explicitly configured to use TCP
   instead of UDP.

A.35.  IETF RFC 8806 - Running a Root Server Local to a Resolver

   This informational document [RFC8806] describes how to obtain and
   operate a local copy of the root zone with examples showing how to
   pull from authoritative sources using a DNS over TCP zone transfer.

A.36.  IETF RFC 8906 - A Common Operational Problem in DNS Servers:
       Failure to Communicate

   This best current practice document [RFC8906] discusses a number of
   DNS operational failure scenarios and how to avoid them.  This
   includes discussions involving DNS over TCP queries, EDNS over TCP,
   and a testing methodoloy that includes a section on verifying DNS
   over TCP functionality.

A.37.  IETF RFC 8932 - Recommendations for DNS Privacy Service Operators

   This best current practice document [RFC8932] presents privacy
   considerations to DNS privacy service operators.  These mechanisms
   sometimes include the use of TCP and are therefore suspectible to
   information leakage such as TCP-based fingerprinting.  This document
   also references a draft version of this document.

A.38.  IETF RFC 8945 - Secret Key Transaction Authentication for DNS
       (TSIG)

   This standards track document [RFC8945] recommends a client use TCP
   if truncated TSIG messages are received.
