2.0  Introduction

This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management Information
Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
community.  In particular, it describes managed objects for modeling a
Multi-Protocol Label Switching [MPLSArch, MPLSFW]/Border Gateway
Protocol Virtual Private Networks.

Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at mpls@uu.net
and the Network-based VPN WG at nbVpn@bbo.com.

This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for the
Internet community.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference
[BCP14].

3.0  Terminology

This document uses terminology from the document describing the MPLS
architecture [MPLSArch] and from the document describing MPLS/BGP VPNs
[MPLSBGPVPN].



4.0  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [SNMPArch].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
     1155 [SMIv1], RFC 1212 [SNMPv1MIBDef] and RFC 1215 [SNMPv1Traps].
     The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902
     [SMIv2], RFC 1903 [SNMPv2TC] and RFC 1904 [SNMPv2Conf].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management information. The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [SNMPv2c]
      and RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM].  The third version of the message
      protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM],
      RFC 2272 [SNMPv3MP] and RFC 2574 [SNMPv3USM].
   
   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [SNMPv2PO].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273
      [SNMPv3App] and the view-based access control mechanism described
      in RFC 2575 [SNMPv3VACM].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  This memo specifies a MIB
module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB conforming to the SMIv1
can be produced through the appropriate translations.  The resulting
translated MIB must be semantically equivalent, except where objects or
events are omitted because no translation is possible (use of
Counter64).  Some machine-readable information in SMIv2 will be

Internet Draft              MPLS VPN MIB             November 9, 2000



converted into textual descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation
process.  However, this loss of machine-readable information is not
considered to change the semantics of the MIB.



5.0  Object Definitions

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One  (ASN.1) defined in the
SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
an administratively assigned name. The object type together with an
object instance serves to uniquely identify a specific instantiation of
the object.  For human convenience, we often use a textual string,
termed the descriptor, to also refer to the object type.
   


6.0  Feature Checklist

The MPLS/BGP Virtual Private Network MIB (MPLS-VPN-MIB) is designed to
satisfy the following requirements and constraints:

     1.   The MIB must support the BGP/MPLS Virtual Private Networks as
          described in RFC 2547bis. It does not support other
          generalized network-based VPN solutions such as IPSec VPNs.
     
     2.   The MIB must support the operation of BGP/MPLS VPN either based on
          an IP backbone that contains only routers/switches, or a layer-2
          backbone (e.g. Frame Relay, ATM).
     
     3.   The MIB must support BGP/MPLS VPN service as Enterprise VPN,
          Carrier's Carrier VPN, or Inter-provider Backbone.
     
     4.   The MIB must support the configuration of BGP/MPLS VPNs under the
          scope listed above in 1, 2, and 3. It can be used for
          service creation, or building the configuration tools to
          achieve MPLS VPN service creation automation.
     
     5.   The MIB must support the maintenance and troubleshooting of
          BGP/MPLS VPN under the scope listed in 1, 2, and 3. It can
          be used, in conjunction with other MIBs to build monitoring
          and troubleshooting network management tools.
     
     6.   The MIB must support BGP/MPLS VPNs which are configured on a
          particular physical interface or sub-interface if the
          interface can be divided (e.g. Frame Relay or ATM) of the PE
          router. The PE router will determine the forwarding table to
          be used based on the particular interface or sub-interface

Internet Draft              MPLS VPN MIB             November 9, 2000



          information.
     
     7.   The MIB must support Provider Edge (PE) routers, which can be
          configured to maintain one or more VPN Routing and
          Forwarding Tables (VRFs).
     
     8.   The MIB must support each interface or sub-interface on a PE router
          that can be configured for a single VPN only.
     
     9.   The MIB must support a configuration where each interface belongs
          to a particular VPN on the PE router and can be configured
          to import or export the information from the same VPN at
          different sites. It can also be configured to import or
          export the information from the different VPNs at the
          different sites.
     
     10.  The MIB must support provider backbone routers (P routers) that are
          not BGP/MPLS VPN aware. The reachability information of MPLS VPN is
          distributed through BGP (IBGP in all cases, EBGP in addition
          in the case of Inter-Provider VPN). The transportation of
          MPLS VPN is performed by LSRs in the backbone (using LDP, or
          RSVP, or both).



7.0  Outline

   T.B.D. ...



8.0  Application of the Interface Group to MPLS
   
   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces.
   
   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be in
   accordance with [IFMIB] which states that the interfaces table
   (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's interfaces
   and that each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of a network
   interface is considered an interface. Thus, the MPLS VPN-enabled
   interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable. This entry is
   then "stacked" upon an underlying ifType=mpls(166) interface. The
   inter-relation of entries in the ifTable is defined by Interfaces
   Stack Group defined in [IFMIB].
   
   When using MPLS VPN-enabled interfaces, the interface stack table
   might appear as follows:

      | Underlying Layer...                       +
      +-------------------------------------------+

   
   In the above diagram, "Underlying Layer..." refers to the ifIndex of
   any interface type, which has been defined for MPLS interworking and
   onto which the MPLS-layer is stacked upon. Examples include ATM,
   Frame Relay, Ethernet, etc.


9.0  Summary of MPLS-VPN-MIB

   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist of the following
   tables:
   

     T.B.D.


10.0 Brief Description of MIB Objects

The following subsections describe the purpose of each of the objects
contained in the MPLS-VPN-MIB.
   

10.1 mplsVpnVrfConfConfTable

This table represents the MPLS/BGP VPNs that are configured. An operator
or Network Management System (NMS) creates an entry in this table for
every MPLS/BGP VPN configured to run in this MPLS domain.


10.2 mplsVPNInterfaceConfTable

This table represents the MPLS/BGP VPN-enabled interfaces. Each entry in
this table corresponds to an entry in the Interfaces MIB. Due to this
correspondence, certain things such as traffic counters will not be
found in this MIB, and instead should be exposed in the Interfaces MIB.

10.3 mplsVPNPerfTable

This table contains objects to measure the performance of MPLS/BGP VPNs
and is an AUGMENT to mplsVPNConfTable. High capacity counters are
provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on objects

such as high-speed interfaces.


11.0 Example of MPLS/BGP VPN Setup

In this section we provide a brief example of using the MIB objects
described in the following section. While this example is not meant to
illustrate very nuance of the MIB, it is intended as an aid to
understanding some of the key concepts.  It is our intent that it is
read only after the reader has gone through the MIB itself.

Defining the VPN:

In mplsVpnConfTable:
{
   mplsVpnVrfConfIndex          = 1,
   mplsVpnVrfName               = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfDescripton         = "Intranet of Company ABC",
   mplsVpnVrfRouteDistinguisher = 100:1,
   mplsVpnVrfRouteDistinguisher = 100:2,
   mplsVpnVrfRouteDistinguisher = 100:1,

   Configuring PE to PE BGP Routing Session with BGP
   extended family
   
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAddrFamilyVpnv4Unicast = true (1),
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborPEAddr       = 10.10.10.1 {the other PE},
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborPEType       = IpV4
   

   Configuring PE to CE BGP Routing Sessions:
   
   mplsVpnVrfName                      = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAddrFamilyVpnv4Unicast = true (1),
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborCEAddr       = 192.123.123.1 {adjacent CE},
   mplsVpnVrfBgpAFNeighborCEType       = IpV4
   
   (or Configuring PE to CE RIP Routing Sessions)

   mplsVpnVrfName                      = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfNetType                   = rip(2),
   mplsVpnVrfRipNetPrefix              = 192.123.123.4 {the network
                                         prefix  to the adjacent CE),

   (or Configuring PE to CE Static Routing Sessions)
   
   mplsVpnVrfName                    = "RED",
   mplsVpnVrfIpRouteVrfForwByType    = IpV4 (1)
   mplsVpnVrfIpRouteVrfForwByAddr    = 192.123.123.1 {forwarded by},
   mplsVpnVrfIpRouteRedistributeConn = true (1)

Note that this example assumes that the P routers are configured with
MPLS LDP and RSVP TE tunnels using existing MIBs.

        can then be used at any LSR within a specific MPLS domain
        to identify this MPLS/BGP VPN. It may also be possible to
