   present at the network edge.  It then matches the responding packets
   by destination address, and restores the original headers.

   NAT itself is not a feature.  It is a mechanism which provides
   features at an application cost.  This document identifies features
   which are supplied by NAT in IPv4 and how these features may be
   provisioned in IPv6.  Both NAT and application-friendly alternatives
   are presented.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


1.  Introduction

   Network Address Translation substitutes a source address in the
   outbound Packet headers at the Internet Egress point for one present
   at the network edge.  It then matches the responding packets by
   destination address, and restores the original headers [RFC2663].
   For some applications, changes in packet headers mismatch application
   semantics, requiring in-band NAT detection or helper services such as
   STUN [RFC3489][RFC3947].  The experience with IPv4 has shown that
   implementing NATs in network gateways is simple, taking few man-
   months to achieve a production ready solution.  The impact of Network
   Address Translation on IPv4 applications development has been
   significant, with development of peer-to-peer and address referring
   applications being hampered [RFC2993].

   Until now, NATs have only existed for IPv4, and for transitioning
   from an IPv6 network to an IPv4 network [RFC2766][RFC4864].  Current
   IPv6 NAT proposals aim at providing the following functions, aimed at
   providing "Feature Parity" with IPv4 [I-D.mrw-behave-nat66]:

   * Topology Concealment

   * Provider Independence

   * Reduce impacts on the global routing table

   * No prefix reassignment on ISP change

   * Address Amplification

   This document explores each of these features and identifies
   capabilities and gaps within the IPv6 protocol suite to deliver
   these.

   The discussion in this document can be seen as an adjunct to existing
   descriptions of IPv6 and NAT relationships [RFC2993].

1.1.  Existing NAT Models for IPv6

   Current NAT proposals for IPv6 allow for a stateless mapping of IPv6
   address or prefix at the network boundary [I-D.mrw-behave-nat66], or
   more traditional stateful NAT and PAT [RFC2663].

   Stateful NAT systems store information regarding the interior address
   used for communication, and allocate another exterior address for
   communication on the Internet.  If packets arrive at another gateway
   which does not have this stored state, communications fail as no
   mapping can be made to an interior address.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


   Stateless NAT systems use an algorithmic mapping to identify the
   exterior address to use on outbound packets, and the reverse mapping
   to identify the interior address for inbound packets.  The scope of
   the changes depends on the algorithm and its parameters.  Arrival of
   an inbound packet at another gateway will generate the same interior
   address, so long as the algorithm and parameters are uniformly
   configured.

1.2.  Application impacts of existing NAT deployments

   While implementation of either stateless or stateful NAT in a gateway
   is relatively simple to perform, the implications for application
   programmers are significant.

   Applications which contain addresses for referral cannot discern
   their exterior address locally.  This means inbound connections can
   only be provisioned by long term static configuration, or by
   determination at application run-time of the exterior IP.

   Existing IPv4 deployment relies heavily on address and port address
   translation [RFC2766], which has the additional impact that inbound
   connections cannot consistently be mapped to the same internal
   address [RFC4787].  As such, mechanisms are required which identify
   the availability and reachability of sessions at particular ports and
   addresses.

1.2.1.  Behaviour of some port address translating IPv4 NATs

   Existing NAT IP testing is provided by in-band addressing tests
   [RFC3489], and by either in-band relaying through external devices
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-ice] or hole-punching to establish.  Both of these
   mechanisms rely upon the availability, trust and trust of third parth

   devices outside the perimeter of the organization.

   Even where a one-to-one or pool mapping of addresses is available in
   NAT, applications cannot make assessments about their visible
   addresses without contacting the exterior network.  Where information
   is provided between end devices, each endpoint must understand that
   addresses can change in transit.


2.  Network Topology Hiding in IPv6

   NAT in IPv4 is used also to prevent simple disclosure of topological
   structures in corporate network environments.  This may be performed
   in order to limit data loss, for commercial purposes, or to reduce
   information flows due to security concerns [CITE].

   Proposals for using NAT within IPv6 cite topology hiding as a
   requirement.  Current IPv6 NAT proposals allow for a stateless
   mapping of an IPv6 address or prefix, or traditional NAT and Port
   Translation.  Other proposals which provide topology hiding use
   tunnel mechanisms or add local routing identifiers to packets in
   transit.

   Independent of whether NAT is in use, topology hiding requires a
   mapping between external addressing and internal addressing.  The
   delivery of topology hiding within these environments is examined
   below.

2.1.  Network Topology Hiding using Stateful Mappings

   If using existing stateful address mapping mechanisms for topology
   hiding, information is lost to the external viewer.  This loss of
   information occurs where the exterior address pool is smaller than
   the available interior addressing, or where allocation of an exterior
   address loses structure.



   I::A -----------> G::A'
           State
         Allocation
   I::B -----------> G::B'

     such that B' =/=> B and A ' =/=> A,

   Stateful mapping operations require a return packet from the Internet
   to be routed by the original gateway or one to which its state
   mappings have been distributed.

   Since state is held within the network may be significantly less than
   the number of hosts in the network.  Address reallocation over time
   could allow further compression of the number of exterior addresses.

2.2.  Network Topology Hiding using Stateless Mappings

   For Stateless address mapping mechanisms, an algorithm provides a
   one-to-one correspondence between interior addresses and externally
   visible addresses [I-D.ietf-behave-v6v4-xlate].  This relies upon an
   algorithmic transform T, which may have site specific parameters,
   such as internal (I) and external prefixes (G), and a site key (k).
   Inbound packets use the inverted transform, to restore the original
   address.


                 T(I,G,k)
   Interior -------------->  Exterior
   Address  <--------------  Address
                ________
                T(I,G,k)

2.2.1.  Prefix Only Transformations

   Existing IPv6 NAT proposals specify a stateless prefix mapping for
   addresses [I-D.mrw-behave-nat66].  Using this transform, only the
   prefix information is changed, with the subnet portion of the prefix
   being exchanged using the Transform Tp.


                Tp(I,G,k)
   I:A::C   <------------->  G:A'::C

   I:B::D   <------------->  G:B'::D

   I:B::E   <------------->  G:B'::E
                _________
                Tp(I,G,k)

   This exchange preserves information about which links and prefixes
   are related, which doesn't hide topology.  It only hides the mapping
   of the internal prefix number.

2.2.2.  Prefix and Suffix Transformations

   Where IPv6 prefixes and suffixes are transformed, and there is a
   stateless mapping between internal and external addresses, beyond the
   site prefix (G or I).  The transforms Tps applies these changes.




Daley                    Expires January 8, 2010                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


                Tps(I,G,k)
   I:A::C   <------------->  G:T::U

   I:B::D   <------------->  G:V::W

   I:B::E   <------------->  G:X::Y
                __________
                Tps(I,G,k)

   Information about relationships between topological elements may be
   obscured, since suffixes are changed.  The number of unique hosts
   communicating on the network cannot be obscured though because
   stateless transforms require a one-to-one mapping between interior
   and exterior addresses.

   Maintaining topology secrecy relies entirely upon keeping the mapping
   transform secret.  Where it makes sense to standardize the base
   transforms, the importance of the site specific key (k) becomes
   critical.

2.3.  Source Address Mappings and NAT

   Each of the above approaches may be deployed with NAT for the purpose
   of internal topology hiding.  Alternatives which make similar
   mappings can achieve the same topology hiding without the impact of
   NAT on applications.

   Some of these alternatives are explored below in Section Section 7.


3.  Provider Independence in IPv6

   One of the motivations for IPv6 Network Address Translation is to
   gain provider independence [NAT66pres].  Provider independence allows
   packets to transit through either one Internet Service Provider (ISP)
   or another.  In order to achieve provider independence, addresses
   advertisable through multiple ISPs are required, or multiple ISP
   specific addresses need to be used.

   IAB/IESG Recommendations on IPv6 Addresses [RFC3177] provides
   guidelines for address allocations to sites.  It identifies that
   sites may require multihoming mechanisms, although it doesn't
   identify valid multihoming schemes.

3.1.  Using Provider Aggregatable Addresses for Multihoming

   Default IP address allocations in IPv6 (and IPv4) are provider
   aggregatable (dependent).  These addresses are advertisable through

   one ISP and provide routing scalability through summarization
   [RFC4291].  With multiple provider aggregatable connections,
   multihoming can be provided using either address selection on the
   end-host, or on a gateway (for example by using NAT).

3.1.1.  Aggregatable Addresses and host selection

   The below shows how addressing is presented to hosts from multiple
   ISPs, along with any stable local prefix (The stable addressing in
   this case comes from Unique Local Addresses [RFC4193]).

          Multihoming using routed provider aggregatable prefixes

   Each of the prefixes is applied across the network and hosts receive
   router advertisements or DHCPv6 address allocations with the prefixes
   [RFC4861][RFC4862][RFC3315].  Hosts then have multiple addresses
   configured, and make assessments within applications to use all or
   one of the addresses.

   Assessments of whether a local or global address is used would be
   based on internal policy (NOTE: This makes assumptions about the
   status of [RFC3484]).  Network connectivity through the address lasts

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


   as long as the provider aggregatable prefix is valid, although if
   connectivity through an ISP fails, application connectivity may
   break.

   This is because TCP binds a source IP/Dest IP/Source Port/Dest Port
   tuple.  Unavailablity of the path between these endpoints will impact
   applications [MHpath selection].  Applications able to withstand
   individual connection failures will be able to survive path failures.
   Otherwise application sockets or APIs may present error conditions
   [RFC2553].

3.1.2.  Provider Aggregatable Addresses and gateway selection

   Where a gateway exists on the path to the Internet, choice of ISP
   paths can be made by that gateway, as shown below.  Internally the
   network operates with a local address plan, and the gateway
   substitutes or translates packet headers in order to load balance or
   provide some robustness in accordance with site policy.

   This scenario has the same session survivability challenges
   illustrated by the host selected provider aggregatable addressing.
   This scenario has the additional issue that that if address
   translation occurs without explicit involvement of the host, failures

   of one routing path are not readily identifiable to the host.

   Even when the gateway fails over to another ISP's addresses, existing
   sessions will fail, and new sessions succeed. even though the local
   addressing plan has not changed.

3.1.3.  Limits of Provider Aggregatable Addressing

   Where Provider Aggregatable addresses are used for multihoming,
   control over inbound connection requests is diminished.  Content
   providers typically provide information about services through domain
   name mechanisms [RFC1035][RFC3596].  A lookup of name to IP address
   mapping occurs, and the client selects one of the available addresses
   for the service.

   For example, if a company has the following Provider Aggregatable
   prefixes from different ISPs, it may provision two IP addresses
   [RFC3849]:


   2001:DB8:0000:/48  ->   2001:DB8:0000:0003:0200:5eff:fe78:9abc
   2001:DB8:ffff:/48  ->   2001:DB8:ffff:0003:0200:5eff:fe78:9abc

   An IPv6 (AAAA) domain name lookup for www.example.com would return
   both of these records either from cache or from the originating DNS
   server.  Content providers have little control over which of these
   addresses are used by clients to initiate sessions.

   Where a client uses TCP to connect to a content service, it selects
   one of the server IP addresses, which with provider aggregatable
   addressing determines which of the ISPs will deliver the traffic.
   Leaving the selection of the ISP to the client is undesirable
   particularly if one of the service providers has capacity constraints
   or is more costly to utilize.

   An alternative solution is to use provider independent addressing.

3.2.  Provider Independent Addressing and Multihoming

   Provider Independent (PI) address prefixes may be advertised through
   multiple ISPs simultaneously.  PI addresses are advertised
   individually according to the source organization's routing policy.
   Announcements from two or more ISPs are typical, with BGP parameters
   being set to identify which path is best [RFC1771][RFC2858].

   This sort of control over path selection toward a particular address
   ensures flexibility for content providers.  Additionally, outbound
   sessions gain survivability from a particular ISP failure, without

   impacting sessions.  This is due to the preservation of IP addressing
   at the application, that is unavailable using provider aggregatable
   addresses.

   Initially, IPv6 address allocation policy did not include Provider
   Independent addressing in order to reduce the number of prefixes
   advertised within the Internet.  The desire of existing multihomed
   content providers to retain equivalent inbound traffic control
   contributed to the regional internet registries allowing allocation
   of IPv6 provider independent addressing for all sites which are
   currently multihomed [APNICv6MH].

   Current (2009/04) allocation policy provides provider independent
   addressing for IPv6 on exactly the same terms as IPv4.  Please note
   that in the past, early adopting organizations received PI address
   blocks even though they were not multihomed.  The current policy does
   not extend PI IPv6 addresses to these organizations.  Please also
   note that policies to acquire new provider independent IPv4
   addressing may change as addresses become scarce.

   In order to provide a stable internal address plan with multiple
   providers, organizations will likely use a local addressing plan such
   as Unique Local Addressing [RFC4193].  In the typical case, the PI
   address plan is deployed across the internal infrastructure of the
   network, in parallel to any local addressing scheme.  This is shown
   below.

    Multihomed provider aggregatable prefixes using routing and source
                            address selection.

   Alternatively, connectivity can be delegated to the gateway, which
   would require a NAT or local delivery scheme to send packets within a
   locally addressed network.


4.  Reduce impacts on the global routing table

   Provider independence of internal packet delivery can be achieved
   without network renumbering by making use of either Provider
   Independent Addressing or Network Address Translation.

   Network Address Translation can be used along with provider
   aggregatable addressing, to ease transition operations when changing
   ISPs.  This means that the addressing which is tied to carriers can
   be aggregated to a single set of routes advertised in the network
   core.

   With Provider Independent addressing, addresses may be retained when
   a ISP change occurs.  As such they are not able to be aggregated or
   summarized within the Internet routing table.




Daley                    Expires January 8, 2010               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


   Note that the current IPv6 allocation policy results in an IPv6
   routing table with a number of routes not greater than the equivalent
   IPv4 routing table.  While this system does not curtail growth of the
   internet routing table, the overall impact in the number of churned
   routes should still be no greater than that of IPv4, especially
   considering that the provider aggregatable address space will not
   need to be so fragmented.


5.  No prefix reassignment on ISP change

   With provider aggregatable addresses, when an organization connects
   to a new ISP, they need to renumber their external addressing plan.
   Where no gateway NAT or local delivery scheme is in place, they will
   also need to renumber their internal addressing.

   Unlike IPv4 though, parallel network addressing infrastructure is
   available and supported by all hosts [RFC4294].  Internal addressing
   plans based on ULA [RFC4193] allow for stable local addresses for
   internal corporate resources regardless of the addresses to be used
   on the Internet.  This means that if renumbering is deployed to end
   hosts either through on-link configuration [RFC4862] or DHCPv6
   [RFC3315], internal connectivity will not be interrupted.

   Additionally, DHCPv6 prefix delegation [RFC3633] provides means for
   changing IPv6 Address allocations on routers in a non-disruptive
   fashion [RFC4193].

   Still in IPv4, renumbering upon ISP change is limited to those hosts
   that hold exterior addresses (or provide lookup records for them, as
   in DNS), and devices performing Network Address Translation.  It is
   desirable that the transitions in IPv6 are able to replicate the ease
   of transition available within IPv4.

   Where similar function is to be deployed, it remains useful to
   determine if the capability can be acquired without damage to
   applications as would occur with Network Address Translation.


6.  Address Amplification

   Address amplification is used to make sure multiple addresses or
   subnets may be served by a smaller address allocation.  This allows
   for preservation of address space, or making use of address space
   otherwise insufficient to route for all local devices.

   This feature of NAT has been extensively used in IPv4 because of
   insufficient allocation of IP addresses to homes and businesses.

   The IAB and IESG recommendations for IPv6 site address allocations
   identify three models allows for each substantive organization
   [RFC3177].

   1. typical deployments of addresses receive a /48 prefix, which
   supplies 65536 subnets per organization.

   2.  When by design only a single subnet is required, a /64 may be
   allocated.

   3.  When absolutely only one device is connecting, a /128 is
   allocated.

   Discussions within the IETF about alternative deployments allow for
   the specification of an intermediate allocation at /56, allowing for
   256 subnets for a household use.

   In either this case, or case 1 above, the number of subnets which can
   be served by each prefix allocation may be sufficient to avoid NAT or
   Local delivery operations.

   For case 2, the unforseen usage of additional devices may later
   become an issue requiring address amplification.  In these cases, a
   local addressing mechanism is required to allocate addressing to edge
   devices.

   In order to achieve address amplification, state must be kept, which
   identifies which of the public address resources is currently in use.
   This precludes all stateless schemes.  Consequently local tunneling,
   Translation extension headers, stateful NAT and NAT with address
   allocation channels may all be used with a smaller number of external
   addresses than internal addresses.


7.  Alternatives to NAT for Network Topology Hiding

   NAT's principal problems are associated with a lack of address
   knowledge in applications [CITE].  Alternatives to NAT require a way
   of allocating external addresses to applications before bindings at
   the application programming interface occur [CITE].  This allows
   applications to function independently of whether an address is
   translated or not.

   Once the exterior address is allocated, devices at the network
   perimeter need to handle delivery and transmission of packets for
   interior devices.  The location of such devices separate to the hosts
   provides opportunities for topology hiding.

   Each of these local delivery mechanisms requires a protocol to be run
   between the host and network.  Participants are likely to be the
   internet access gateway itself, and the host participating in the
   communications.

7.1.  Local Tunnels For network topology hiding

   As presented at IETF 74 by Dave Thaler, local tunnelling provides
   equivalent support for address hiding, when deployed at the network
   perimeter.

                    Use of a local tunnel to a gateway

   Devices discover a gateway using local configuration mechanisms, such
   as DHCPv6 [RFC3315][RFC3736] or IPv6 Router Discovery [RFC4861].  A
   tunnel is established to the gateway, and either a stateful
   relationship is established, or an algorithmic mapping of addresses
   (such as identified for stateless NATs above) is used to provide IP
   addressing information.

   The local topology hiding mechanisms are bound by the same
   limitations as for the equivalent mechanism under NAT.  Applications
   have the advantage that they are able to bind virtual IP addresses
   associated with the allocated address.  This removes the requirement
   for in-band address discovery mechanisms prevalent in IPv4 [RFC3849].

   Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 provides an example of one such tunneling
   mechanism.  It incorporates discovery mechanisms, a stateful binding
   of addresses, and an ability to update stateful bindings (as is
   necessary for mobile environments).

   Explicit tunnel systems allow for failover by directing
   communications through an alternate gateway.  Topology hiding is
   preserved, and existing communications continue after tunnel
   connection repair.  This is not a service available with stateful
   Network Address Translations.

7.2.  Translation extension headers For network Topology Hiding

   Tony Hain identified a mechanism for providing topology hiding
   through use of an IPv6 extension header that replaces a packet source
   address when passing through a gateway or firewall.

   A routing header could be constructed and placed on the packet, to be
   examined upon passage through the gateway.  This header would contain
   the topologically correct exterior address for the interior host.
   The gateway would save the interior->exterior address mapping, and
   pass the packet upstream toward the destination.

   Inbound packets would be modified with a routing or desintation
   header to include the path taken upon ingress through a gateway.  The

   original header is presented to upper layer applications as the
   application address.

      Example inbound packet flows with multiple levels of NAT using
                              routing header

   Outbound data flows use information about exterior addressing within
   the application, and encapsulate data with information about external
   addresses in a routing header, along with the internal address
   comprising the packet header.


   Outbound

    B:A  +--+ B1:A R[B] +--+ B2:A R[B1,B] +--+ B3:A R[B2,B1,B]
   <-----|  |<----------|  |<-------------|  |<----------------
         +--+           +--+              +--+

      Example outbound packet flows with multiple levels of NAT using
                              routing header

   As packets pass through a gateway, the source address is replaced
   with an address from the next routing header.  The contents of the
   routing extension header allow outbound mapping, or stored state to
   be created on a gateway.  This allows the packet to pass to an
   exterior network containing only the source address information
   visible to the exterior domain.

   Outbound packets reaching a gateway without valid routing header
   information are rejected by ICMP message.  This causes systems to
   learn the location and addressing requirements of the gateway, if
   necessary for internet access.  Additionally, policy could be
   specified in the first instance by DHCP.

   Mappings can be stateless, or stateful as for pool NATs.  The same
   mapping criteria for Topology Hiding apply.

7.3.  Address Allocation Channel for NAT

   It is possible to perform Network address translation in a way that
   allows applications to bind to the exterior address.  This requires

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


   an address allocation channel which informs interior devices of their
   exterior IP address mapping.

   For stateless mappings, this entails informing the hosts as to their
   transform algorithm.  Devices communicating through the gateway can
   then identify.

   For stateful mappings, a communication with the gateway would be
   required, although packets themselves would require no additional
   tunnel or header components.

   In both of these cases, identification of internal destinations would
   be valuable to ensure that application address allocation uses an
   appropriate address.

   Due to the addition of a discovery channel, this has been categorized
   as a local delivery mechanism, rather than a pure NAT.


8.  Problems with NAT and Topology Hiding

   Since applications are initially unaware of their public addresses,
   and the boundary where topology hiding is present.  Protocols
   expressing identity or addressing information may require testing and
   application awareness.

   Indeed, the predominant NAT and Firewall traversal mechanisms used in
   IPv4 perform initial NAT mapping tests using native source addresses.

   Additionally, network applications such as traceroute can identify
   those hosts which share hop-distance and delay.  In some
   circumstances it is possible to construct the topology solely from
   such information.


9.  Problems with Local Delivery mechanisms and Topology Hiding

   Local delivery mechanisms that avoid NAT have a series of issues
   which must be managed.

   * Discovery

   * Local Transport

   * MTU issues

   * Backward compatibility.

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


   * Recursion

   * Source Address Selection.

9.1.  Discovery

   Local delivery mechanisms require new and reliable mechanisms which
   describe operations at the network boundary.

   Additionally, the correct operation of existing IPv6 devices which do
   not support local delivery mechanisms need to be identified.

9.2.  Local Transport

   The construction of packets to be delivered to network boundaries is
   required in a way which allows traversal of firewalls and reliable
   gateway operation.

9.3.  MTU Issues

   The transfer of data within a local delivery encapsulation may
   require addition of addressing and extension headers.  In some
   circumstances this will impact on the efficiency of transmission due
   to packet overheads.  Additionally, while the aim of local delivery
   is to reduce application impacts, there is some interplay between the
   reduced MTU and application operations [RFC2292][RFC2460].

9.4.  Backward Compatibility

   The correct operation of existing IPv6 devices which do not support
   local delivery mechanisms need to be identified.

9.5.  Recursion

   If multiple levels of local delivery are required, the issues of
   discovery, delivery, MTU and source addressing are

9.6.  Source Address Selection

   Source address selection requires particular care in order to
   insulate applications from the address translation knowledge required
   in IPv4 NAT today.  Since the application program doesn't have to
   make explicit computations about determining addressing, the u
   require revisiting. system has to assist in finding which of the
   addresses is suitable for binding in communications.

   The operating system needs to be able to identify that an address on
   the Internet requires connectivity through a Virtual IP address held

Internet-Draft          IPv6 Function without NAT              July 2009


   at the gateway, rather than through a locally acquired address.

   Existing IPv6 source address selection rules go part way toward this,
   by providing scope-matching constructs [RFC3484].  In order to ensure
   that communications use the external gateway provided address,
   support to distinguish between ULA addressed destinations and
   globally addressed destinations should be incorporated into this
   specification.  This could be assisted by providing address selection
   advice in gateway discovery mechanisms which identify address
   prefixes which are local, and those requiring local delivery
   services, even where globally routable addresses are used within a
   local network.


10.  General problems with Topology Hiding and the Internet

   Whether or not appplication programs understand their external
   address, topological and network composition information still passes
   network boundaries.  Application report bugs including stack traces
   [CITE], Cookies uniquely identify hosts and browsers [CITE]. and
   operating system information can be gleaned through reviewing
   fragmentation and TCP windowing behaviour [CITE][CITE].

   As such neither NAT or an address preserving local delivery mechanism
   is a complete solution to divulgence of operating information.

   The author considers that due to the ongoing issues in application
   transparency place address preserving mechanisms in a more favourable
   position.
