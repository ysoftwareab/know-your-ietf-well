       DNS Name Autoconfiguration for Internet of Things Devices
                  draft-jeong-its-iot-dns-autoconf-00

Abstract

   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for the global
   (or local) DNS names of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as
   sensors, actuators, and in-vehicle units.  By this scheme, the DNS
   name of an IoT device can be autoconfigured with the device's
   category and model in wired and wireless target networks (e.g.,
   vehicle, road network, home, office, shopping mall, and smart grid).
   This DNS name lets IoT users (e.g., drivers, passengers, home
   residents, and customers) in the Internet (or local network) easily
   identify each device for monitoring and remote-controlling it in the
   target network.

Internet-Draft            IoT DNS Name Autoconf               March 2016


1.  Introduction

   Many Internet of Things (IoT) devices (e.g., sensors, actuators, and
   in-vehicle units) have begun to have wireless communication
   capability (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, and ZigBee) for monitoring and
   remote-controlling in a local network or the Internet.  According to
   the capacity, such IoT devices can be categorized into high-capacity
   devices and low-capacity devices.  High-capacity devices have a high-
   power processor and a large storage, such as vehicles, road
   infrastructure devices (e.g., road-side unit, traffic light, and
   loop-detector), appliances (e.g., television, refrigerator, air
   conditioner, and washing machine), and smart devices (smartphone and
   tablet).  They are placed in environments (e.g., vehicle, road
   network, home, office, shopping mall, and smart grid) for the direct
   use for human users, and they require the interaction with human
   users.  Low-capacity devices have a low-power processor and a small
   storage, such as sensors (e.g., in-vehicle units, light sensor,
   meter, and fire detector) and actuators (e.g., vehicle engine, signal
   light, street light, and room temperature controller).  They are
   installed for the easy management of environments (e.g., vehicle,
   road network, home, office, store, and factory), and they do not
   require the interaction with human users.

   For the Internet connectivity of IoT devices, a variety of parameters
   (e.g., address prefixes, default routers, and DNS servers) can be
   automatically configured by Neighbor Discovery (ND) for IP Version 6,
   IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration, and IPv6 Router
   Advertisement (RA) Options for DNS Configuration [RFC4861][RFC4862]
   [RFC6106].

   For these IoT devices, the manual configuration of DNS names will be
   cumbersome and time-consuming as the number of them increases rapidly
   in a network.  It will be good for such DNS names to be automatically
   configured such that they are readable to human users.

   Multicast DNS (mDNS) in [RFC6762] can provide DNS service for
   networked devices on a local link (e.g., home network and office
   network) without any conventional recursive DNS server. mDNS also
   supports the autoconfiguration of a device's DNS name without the
   intervention of the user. mDNS aims at the DNS naming service for the
   local DNS names of the networked devices on the local link rather
   than the DNS naming service for the global DNS names of such devices
   in the Internet.  However, for IoT devices accessible from the
   Internet, mDNS cannot be used.  Thus, a new autoconfiguration scheme
   becomes required for the global DNS names of IoT devices.

   This document proposes an autoconfiguration scheme for the global (or
   local) DNS names of IoT devices.  Since an autoconfigured DNS name

   contains the device category and model of a device, IoT users in the
   Internet (or local network) can easily identify the device.  With
   this device category and model, they will be able to monitor and
   remote-control each device with mobile smart devices (e.g.,
   smartphone and tablet) by resolving its DNS name into the
   corresponding IPv6 address.

1.1.  Applicability Statements

   It is assumed that IoT devices have networking capability through
   wired or wireless communication media, such as Ethernet [IEEE-802.3],
   WiFi [IEEE-802.11][IEEE-802.11a][IEEE-802.11b][IEEE-802.11g]
   [IEEE-802.11n], Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC)
   [IEEE-802.11p], Bluetooth [IEEE-802.15.1], and ZigBee [IEEE-802.15.4]
   in a local area network (LAN) or personal area network (PAN).

   Also, it is assumed that each IoT device has a factory configuration
   (called device configuration) having device category (e.g., vehicle,
   road-side unit, smart TV, smartphone, tablet, and refrigerator) and
   model (i.e., a specific model name of the device).  This device
   configuration can be read by the device for DNS name
   autoconfiguration.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology described in [RFC4861] and
   [RFC4862].  In addition, four new terms are defined below:

   o  Device Configuration: A factory configuration that has device
      category (e.g., vehicle, road-side unit, smart TV, smartphone,
      tablet, and refrigerator) and model (i.e., a specific model name
      of the device).

   o  DNS Search List (DNSSL): The list of DNS suffix domain names used
      by IPv6 hosts when they perform DNS query searches for short,
      unqualified domain names [RFC6106].

   o  DNSSL Option: IPv6 RA option to deliver the DNSSL information to
      IPv6 hosts [RFC6106].

Internet-Draft            IoT DNS Name Autoconf               March 2016


4.  Overview

   This document specifies an autoconfiguration scheme for an IoT device
   using device configuration and DNS search list.  Device configuration
   has device category and device model.  DNS search list has DNS suffix
   domain names that represent the DNS domains of a network having the
   IoT device [RFC6106].

   As an IPv6 host, the IoT device can obtain DNS search list through
   IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) with DNS Search List (DNSSL) Option
   [RFC4861][RFC6106] or DHCPv6 with Domain Search List Option
   [RFC3315][RFC3736][RFC3646].

   The IoT device can construct its DNS name with the concatenation of
   device category, device model, and domain name.  Since there exist
   more than one device with the same model, the DNS name should have a
   unique identification to differentiate multiple devices with the same
   model.

   Since both RA and DHCPv6 can be simultaneously used for the parameter
   configuration for IPv6 hosts, this document considers the DNS name
   autoconfiguration in the coexistence of RA and DHCP.

5.  DNS Name Autoconfiguration

   The DNS name autoconfiguration for an IoT device needs the
   acquisition of DNS search list through either RA [RFC6106] or DHCPv6
   [RFC3646].  Once the DNS search list is obtained, the IoT device
   autonomously constructs its DNS name(s) with the DNS search list and
   its device information.

5.1.  DNS Name Format

   A DNS name for an IoT device has the following format as in Figure 1:

        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
        |   unique_id.device_model.device_category.domain_name    |
        +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                   Figure 1: IoT Device DNS Name Format

   Fields:

     unique_id          unique identifier to guarantee the uniqueness
                        of the DNS name in ASCII characters.  The
                        identifier MAY be a sequence number or
                        alphanumeric with readability, such as product
                        name.

     device_model       device's model name in ASCII characters.  It
                        is a product model name provided by the
                        manufacturer.

     device_category    device's category name in ASCII characters,
                        such as vehicle, road-side unit, engine, gear,
                        smart TV, refrigerator, air conditioner,
                        smartphone, tablet, light, and meter.

     domain_name        domain name that represents a DNS domain for
                        the network having the IoT devices.

   Note each subdomain (i.e., unique_id, device_model, device_category,
   and domain_name) in the domain name format in Figure 1 is expressed
   using the name syntax described in [RFC1035].

5.2.  DNS Name Format with Object Identifier

   A DNS name for an IoT device can have the following format with
   object identifier (OID), which is defined in [oneM2M-OID], as in
   Figure 2:

            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
            |   unique_id.object_identifier.OID.domain_name   |
            +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

               Figure 2: IoT Device DNS Name Format with OID

   Fields:

     unique_id          unique identifier to guarantee the uniqueness
                        of the DNS name in ASCII characters.  The
                        identifier MAY be a sequence number or
                        alphanumeric with readability, such as product
                        name.

     object_identifier  device's object identifier that consists of a
                        higher arc, that is, M2M node indication ID (
                        i.e., the concatenation of the managing
                        organization, administration, data country
                        code, and M2M node) and a sequence of four
                        arcs (i.e., manufacturer ID, model ID, serial
                        ID, and expanded ID) as defined in
                        [oneM2M-OID]. The fields are seperated by an
                        underscore '_'.

     OID                subdomain for the keyword of OID to indicate
                        that object_identifier is used.

     domain_name        domain name that represents a DNS domain for
                        the network having the IoT devices.

   Note each subdomain (i.e., unique_id, object_identifier, OID, and
   domain_name) in the domain name format in Figure 2 is expressed using
   the name syntax described in [RFC1035].

5.3.  Procedure of DNS Name Autoconfiguration

   The procedure of DNS name autoconfiguration is performed through a
   DNSSL option delivered by either RA [RFC6106] or DHCPv6 [RFC3646].

5.3.1.  DNS Name Generation

   When as an IPv6 host a device receives a DNSSL option through either
   RA or DHCPv6, it checks the validity of the DNSSL option.  If the
   option is valid, the IPv6 host performs the DNS name
   autoconfiguration with each DNS suffix domain name in the DNSSL
   option as follows:

   1.  The host constructs its DNS name with the DNS suffix domain name
       along with device configuration (i.e., device category and device
       model) and a selected identifier (as unique_id) that is
       considered unique, as shown in Figure 1.

   2.  The host constructs an IPv6 unicast address as a tentative
       address with a 64-bit network prefix and the last 64 bits of the
       MD5 hashed value of the above DNS name.

   3.  The host constructs the solicited-node multicast address in
       [RFC4861] corresponding to the tentative IPv6 address.

   4.  The host performs Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) for the IPv6
       address with the solicited-node multicast address [RFC4861]
       [RFC4862].

   5.  If there is no response from the DAD, the host sets the IPv6
       tentative address as its IPv6 unicast address and regards the
       constructed DNS name as unique on the local link.  Otherwise,
       since the DAD fails because of DNS name conflict, go to Step 1
       for a new DNS name generation with another identifier for
       unique_id.

   6.  Since the DNS name is proven to be unique, it is used as the
       device's DNS name and the DNS autoconfiguration is done for the
       given DNS suffix domain name.  Also, the host joins the
       solicited-node multicast address for the verified DNS name in
       order to prevent other hosts from using this DNS name.



Jeong, et al.          Expires September 18, 2016               [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            IoT DNS Name Autoconf               March 2016


   When the DNS search list has more than one DNS suffix domain name,
   the IPv6 host repeats the above procedure until all of the DNS
   suffixes are used for the DNS name autoconfiguration along with the
   IPv6 unicast autoconfiguration corresponding to the DNS name.

5.3.2.  DNS Name Collection

   Once as IPv6 hosts the devices have autoconfigured their DNS names,
   as a collector, any IPv6 node (i.e., router or host) in the same
   subnet can collect the device DNS names using IPv6 Node Information
   (NI) protocol [RFC4620].

   For a collector to collect the device DNS names without any prior
   node information, a new NI query needs to be defined.  That is, a new
   ICMPv6 Code (e.g., 3) SHOULD be defined for the collection of the
   IPv6 host DNS names.  The Data field is not included in the ICMPv6
   header since the NI query is for all the IPv6 hosts in the same
   subnet.  The Qtype field for NI type is set to 2 for Node Name.

   The query SHOULD be transmitted by the collector to a link-local
   multicast address for this NI query.  Assume that a link-local scope
   multicast address (e.g., all-nodes multicast address, FF02::1) SHOULD
   be defined for device DNS name collection such that all the IPv6
   hosts join this link-local multicast address for the device DNS name
   collection service.

   When an IPv6 host receives this query sent by the collector in
   multicast, it transmits its Reply with its DNS name with a random
   interval between zero and Query Response Interval, as defined by
   Multicast Listener Discovery Version 2 [RFC3810].  This randomly
   delayed Reply allows the collector to collect the device DNS names
   with less frame collision probability by spreading out the Reply time
   instants.

   After the collector collects the device DNS names, it resolves the
   DNS names into the corresponding IPv6 addresses by NI protocol
   [RFC4620] with the ICMPv6 Code 1 of NI Query.  This code indicates
   that the Data field of the NI Query has the DNS name of an IoT
   device.  The IoT device that receives this NI query sends the
   collector an NI Reply with its IPv6 address in the Data field.

   For DNS name resolution service, the collector can register the
   pair(s) of DNS name and IPv6 address for each IPv6 host into an
   appropriate designated DNS server for the DNS domain suffix of the
   DNS name.  It is assumed that the collector is configured to register
   DNS names into the designated DNS server in a secure way based on
   DNSSEC [RFC4033][RFC6840].  This registration of the DNS name and
   IPv6 address can be performed by DNS dynamic update [RFC2136].



Jeong, et al.          Expires September 18, 2016               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft            IoT DNS Name Autoconf               March 2016


   Before registering the DNS name into the designated DNS server, the
   collector SHOULD verify the uniqueness of the DNS name in the
   intended DNS domain by sending a DNS query for the resolution of the
   DNS name.  If there is no corresponding IPv6 address for the queried
   DNS name, the collector registers the DNS name and the corresponding
   IPv6 address into the designated DNS server.  On the other hand, if
   there is such a corresponding IPv6 address, the DNS name is regarded
   as duplicate (i.e., not unique), and so the corresponder notifies the
   corresponding IoT device with the duplicate DNS name of an error
   message of DNS name duplication using NI protocol.  When an IoT
   device receives such a DNS name duplication error, it needs to
   construct a new DNS name and repeats the procedure of device DNS name
   generation along with the uniqueness test of the device DNS name in
   its subnet.

   The two separate procedures of the DNS name collection and IPv6
   address resolution in the above NI protocol can be consolidated into
   a single collection for the pairs of DNS names and the corresponding
   IPv6 addresses.  For such an optimization, a new ICMPv6 Code (e.g.,
   4) is defined for the NI Query to query the pair of a DNS name and
   the corresponding IPv6 address.  With this code, the collector can
   collect the pairs of each IoT device's DNS name and IPv6 address in
   one NI query message rather than two NI query messages.

5.3.3.  DNS Name Retrieval

   A smart device like smartphone can retrieve the DNS names of IoT
   devices by contacting a global (or local) DNS server having the IoT
   device DNS names.  If the smart device can retrieve the zone file
   with the DNS names, it can display the information of IoT devices in
   a target network, such as home network and office network.  With this
   information, the user can monitor and control the IoT devices in the
   Internet (or local network).

6.  Location-Aware DNS Name Configuration

   If the DNS name of an IoT device includes location information, it
   allows users to easily identify the physical location of each device.
   This document proposes the representation of location in a DNS name.

6.1.  Macro-Location-Aware DNS Name

   If location information (such as cross area, intersection, and road
   segment in a road network) is available to an IoT device, a keyword
   for the location can be used to construct a DNS name as subdomain
   name.  This location information lets users track the position of
   mobile devices (such as vehicle, smartphone, and tablet).  The
   physical location of the device is defined as macro-location for DNS

   naming.

   A subdomain name for macro-location (denoted as mac_loc) MAY be
   placed between device_category and domain_name of the DNS name format
   in Figure 3.  A localization scheme for device location is beyond the
   scope of this document.

6.2.  Micro-Location-Aware DNS Name

   An IoT device can be located in the center, edge, or corner in a
   place that is specified by macro-location.  For example, assume that
   a loop-detector is located in the start or end position of a road
   segment.  If the DNS name for the loop-detector contains the start or
   end position of the living room, a road network administrator can
   find it easily.  In this document, for this DNS naming, the detailed
   location for an IoT device can be specified as a micro-location
   subdomain name.

   A subdomain name for micro-location (denoted as mic_loc) MAY be
   placed between device_category and domain_name of the DNS name format
   in Figure 3.  A localization scheme for micro-location is beyond the
   scope of this document.

   To denote both macro-location (i.e., mac_loc) and micro-location
   (i.e., mic_loc) into a DNS name, the following format is described as
   in Figure 3:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   | unique_id.device_model.device_category.mic_loc.mac_loc.domain_name|
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

              Figure 3: Location-Aware Device DNS Name Format

   Fields:

     unique_id          unique identifier to guarantee the uniqueness
                        of the DNS name in ASCII characters.  The
                        identifier MAY be a sequence number or
                        alphanumeric with readability, such as product
                        name.

     device_model       device's model name in ASCII characters.  It
                        is a product model name provided by the
                        manufacturer.

     device_category    device's category name in ASCII characters,
                        such as vehicle, road-side unit, engine, gear,
                        smart TV, refrigerator, air conditioner,

                        smartphone, tablet, light, and meter.


     mic_loc            device's micro-location, such as center, edge,
                        and corner.

     mac_loc            device's macro-location, such as road segment.

     domain_name        domain name that represents a DNS domain for
                        the network having the IoT devices.

   Note each subdomain (e.g., mic_loc and mac_loc) in the domain name
   format in Figure 3 is expressed using the name syntax described in
   [RFC1035].

6.3.  Location-Aware DNS Name with Object Identifier

   Instead of device_model and device_category, object_identifier can be
   used for a location-aware DNS name as specified in Figure 4:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      | unique_id.object_identifier.OID.mic_loc.mac_loc.domain_name |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

7.  DNS Name Management for Mobile IoT Devices

   Some IoT devices can have mobility, such as vehicle, smartphone,
   tablet, laptop computer, and cleaning robot.  This mobility allows
   the IoT devices to move from a subnet to another subnet where subnets
   can have different domain suffixes, such as
   coordinate.road_segment.road, coordinate.intersection.road,
   living_room.home and garage.home.  The DNS name change (or addition)
   due to the mobility should be considered.

   To deal with DNS name management in mobile environments, whenever an
   IoT device enters a new subnet and receives DNS suffix domain names,
   it generates its new DNS names and registers them into a designated
   DNS server, specified by RDNSS option.

   When the IoT device recognizes the movement to another subnet, it can
   delete its previous DNS name(s) from the DNS server having the DNS
   name(s), using DNS dynamic update [RFC2136].  For at least one DNS
   name to remain in a DNS server for the location management in Mobile
   IPv6 [RFC6275], the IoT device does not delete its default DNS name
   in its home network in Mobile IPv6.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document shares all the security issues of the NI protocol that
   are specified in the "Security Considerations" section of [RFC4620].

   To prevent the disclosure of location information for privacy
   concern, the subdomains related to location can be encrypted by a
   shared key or public-and-private keys.  For example, a DNS name of
   vehicle1.coordinate1.road_segment.road can be represented as
   vehicle1.xxx.yyy.road where xxx is a string of the encrypted
   representation of the coordinate (denoted as coordinate1) in the
   road_segment and yyy is a string of the encrypted representation of
   the subdomain road_segment.
