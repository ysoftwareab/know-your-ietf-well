Abstract

   One of the missing features in the existing Internet mail and
   messaging standards is a facility for server-to-server and server-to-
   client event notifications related to message store events.  As the
   scope of Internet mail expands to support more diverse media (such as
   voice mail), devices (such as cell phones) and to provide rich
   interactions with other services (such as web portals and legal
   compliance systems), the need for an interoperable notification

   events which interest real-world consumers of such a system.

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


1.  Introduction

   A message store is used to organize Internet Messages [RFC2822] into
   one or more mailboxes, possibly hierarchical, annotate them in
   various ways and provide access to these messages and associated
   meta-data.  Three different standards-based protocols have been
   widely deployed to remotely access a message store.  Post Office
   Protocol (POP) [RFC1939] provides simple download-and-delete access
   to a single mail drop (which is a subset of the functionality
   typically associated with a message store).  Internet Message Access
   Protocol (IMAP) [RFC3501] provides an extensible feature-rich model
   for online, offline and disconnected access to a message store with
   minimal constraints on any associated "fat-client" user interface.
   Finally, mail access applications built on top of Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP) [RFC2616] which run in standards-based web browsers
   provide a third standards-based access mechanism for online-only
   access.

   While simple and/or ad-hoc mechanisms for notifications have sufficed
   to some degree in the past (e.g., Simple New Mail Notification
   [RFC4146], IMAP4 IDLE command [RFC2177]), as the scope and importance
   of message stores expands, the demand for a more complete store
   notification system increases.  Some of the driving forces behind
   this demand include:

   o  Mobile devices with intermittent network connectivity that have
      "new mail" or "message count" indicators

   o  Unified messaging systems which include both Internet and voice
      mail require support for a message waiting indicator on phones

   o  Interaction with systems for event-based or utility-computing
      billing

   o  Simplify the process of passing message store events to non-
      Internet notification systems

   o  A calendar system may wish to subscribe to MessageNew
      notifications in order to support iMIP [RFC2447].

   o  Some jurisdictions have laws or regulations for information
      protection and auditing which require interoperable protocols
      between message stores built by messaging experts and compliance
      auditing systems built by compliance experts.

   Vendors who have deployed proprietary notification systems for their
   Internet message stores have seen significant demand to provide
   notifications for more and more events.  As a first step towards

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


   building a notification system, this document attempts to enumerate
   the core events that real-world customers demand.

   This document includes those events which can be generated by the use
   of IMAP4Rev1 [RFC3501] and some existing extensions.  As new IMAP
   extensions are defined, or additional event types or parameters need
   to be added, the set specified here can be extended by means of an
   IANA registry with update requirements, as specified in Section 6.

1.1.  Conventions Used in this Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

      future events section to reflect this change.

   o  Removed unnecessary normative reference to NAMESPACE.


2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document:

   mailbox
      A container for Internet messages and/or child mailboxes.  A
      mailbox may or may not permit delivery of new messages via a mail
      delivery agent.

   mailbox identifier
      A mailbox identifier provides sufficient information to identify a
      specific mailbox on a specific server instance.  An IMAP URL can
      be a mailbox identifier.

   message access protocols
      Protocols which provide clients (e.g., a mail user agent or web
      browser) with access to the message store including but not
      limited to IMAP, POP and HTTP.

   message context
      As defined in [RFC3458].

   UIDVALIDITY
      As defined in IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501].  UIDVALIDITY is critical to the
      correct operation of a caching mail client.  When it changes, the
      client must flush its cache.  It's particularly important to
      include UIDVALIDITY with event notifications related to message
      addition or removal in order to keep the message data correctly
      synchronized.


3.  Event Model

   The events that are generated by a message store depend to some
   degree on the model used to represent a message store.  The model the
   IETF has for a message store is implicit from IMAP4rev1 and
   extensions, so that model is assumed by this document.

   A message store event typically has an associated mailbox name and
   usually has an associated user name (or authorization identity if
   using the terminology from SASL [RFC4422]).  Events referring to a
   specific message can use an IMAP URL [RFC2192] to do so.  Events



Newman & Gellens         Expires January 7, 2008                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


   referring to a set of messages can use an IMAP URL to the mailbox
   plus an IMAP UID set.

   Each notification has a type and parameters.  The type determines the
   type of event, while the parameters supply information about the
   context of the event that may be used to adjust subscription
   preferences or may simply supply data associated with the event.  The
   types and parameter names in this document are restricted to US-ASCII
   printable characters so these events can be easily mapped to an
   arbitrary notification system.  However, this document assumes
   arbitrary parameter values (including large and multi-line values)
   can be encoded with the notification system.  Systems which lack that
   feature could only implement a subset of these events.

   This document does not specify which event parameters are mandatory
   or optional.  That is done when actual message formats or bindings to
   a notification system are completed.

   [[anchor10: Should optional vs. mandatory be in this document?]]

   For scalability reasons, some degree of filtering at event generation
   is necessary.  At the very list, the ability to turn on and off
   groups of related events and to suppress inclusion of large
   parameters (such as messageContent) is needed.  A sophisticated
   publish/subscribe notification system may be able to propagate
   cumulative subscription information to the publisher.

   some of these events might be logically collapsed into a single event
   type with a required parameter to distinguish between the cases
   (e.g., QuotaExceed and QuotaWithin).  However until such time that an
   event subscription model is formulated, it's not practical to make
   such decisions.  We thus note only the fact that some of these events
   may be viewed as a single event type.


4.  Event Types

   This section discusses the different types of events useful in a
   message store event notification system.  The intention is to
   document the events sufficient to cover about 95% of the known use
   cases while leaving less common event types for the future.  This
   section mentions parameters which are important or specific to the
   events described here.  Event parameters likely to be included in
   most or all notifications are discussed in the next section.

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


4.1.  Message Addition and Deletion

   This section includes events related to message addition and
   deletion.

   MessageAppend
      A message was appended or concatenated to a mailbox by a message
      access client.  For the most part, this is identical to the
      MessageNew event type, except that the SMTP envelope information
      is not included as a parameter, but information about which
      protocol triggered the event may be included.  See the MessageNew
      event for more information.

   MessageExpire
      One or more messages were expired from a mailbox due to server
      expiration policy and are no longer accessible by the end-user.

      The parameters include a mailbox identifier which must include
      UIDVALIDITY.  A UID set references the messages.  Information
      about which server expiration policy was applied may be included
      as parameters in a future version.

   MessageExpunge
      One or more messages were expunged from a mailbox by an IMAP
      CLOSE/EXPUNGE, POP3 DELE+QUIT, HTTP or equivalent client action
      and are no longer accessible by the end-user.

      The parameters include a mailbox identifier which must include
      UIDVALIDITY, a UID set, and may also indicate which access
      protocol triggered the event.

   MessageNew
      A new message was received into a mailbox via a message delivery
      agent.

      The parameters include a message identifier which must include
      UIDVALIDITY and UID for IMAP-accessible message stores.  The
      parameters may also include the entire new message itself,
      possibly an SMTP envelope and other arbitrary message and mailbox
      meta-data.  The set of parameters included should be adjustable to
      the client's preference with limits set by server policy.  An
      interesting policy, for example, would be to include messages up
      to 2K in size with the notification, but for larger messages to
      include a URLAUTH [RFC4467] reference.

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


   QuotaExceed
      An operation failed (typically MessageNew) because the user's
      mailbox exceeded one of the quotas (e.g., disk quota, message
      quota, quota by message context, etc).  The parameters should
      include at least the relevant user and quota, and optionally the
      mailbox.  Quota usage should be included if possible.  Parameters
      needed to extend this to support quota by context are not
      presently described in this document, but could be added in the
      future.

   QuotaWithin
      An operation occurred (typically MessageExpunges or
      MessageExpires) which reduced the user's quota usage under their
      limit.

4.2.  Message Flags

   This section includes events related to changes in message flags.

   MessageRead
      One or more messages in the mailbox were marked as read or seen by
      a user.  Note that POP has no concept of read or seen messages, so
      these events are only generated by IMAP or HTTP clients (or
      equivalent).

      The parameters include a mailbox identifier and a set of message
      UIDs.

   MessageTrash
      One or more messages were marked for future deletion by the user
      but are still accessible over protocol (the user's client may or
      may not make these messages accessible through its user
      interface).

      The parameters include a mailbox identifier and a set of message
      UIDs.

   FlagsSet
      One or more messages in the mailbox had an IMAP flag or keyword
      set.

      The parameters include a list of IMAP flag or keyword names that
      were set, a mailbox identifier and a set of message UIDs that were
      impacted.  For compatibility with simpler clients, it should be
      configurable whether setting the \Seen or \Deleted flags results
      in this event or the simpler MessageRead/MessageTrash events.  By
      default, the simpler message forms should be used for MessageRead
      and MessageTrash.

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


   FlagsClear
      One or more messages in the mailbox had an IMAP flag or keyword
      cleared.

      The parameters include a list of IMAP flag or keyword names that
      were cleared, a mailbox identifier and a set of message UIDs that
      were impacted.  The flagName not include \Recent.

4.3.  Access Accounting

   This section lists events related to message store access accounting.

   Login
      A user has logged in to the system via IMAP, HTTP, POP or some
      other mechanism.

      The parameters include the domain name and port used to access the
      server and the user's authorization identity.  Additional possible
      parameters include the client's IP address and port, the
      authentication identity (if different from the authorization
      identity), the service name, the authentication mechanism,
      information about any negotiated security layers, a timestamp and
      other information.

   Logout
      A user has logged out or otherwise been disconnected from the
      message store via IMAP, HTTP, POP or some other mechanism.

      The parameters include the server domain name and the user's
      authorization identity.  Additional parameters may include any of
      the information from the "Login" event as well as information
      about the type of disconnect (graceful, abort, timeout, security
      layer error), the duration of the connection or session and other
      information.

4.4.  Mailbox Management

   This section lists events related to the management of mailboxes.

   MailboxCreate
      A mailbox has been created, or an access control changed on an
      existing mailbox so that it is now accessible by the user.  If the
      mailbox creation caused the creation of new mailboxes earlier in
      the hierarchy, separate MailboxCreate events are not generated for
      those as their creation is implied.

      The parameters include the created mailbox identifier, its
      UIDVALIDITY for IMAP-accessible message stores, and may also

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


      indicate which access protocol triggered the event.  Access/
      permissions information (such as ACL [RFC4314] settings) require a
      standardized format to be included, and so are left for future
      extension.

   MailboxDelete
      A mailbox has been deleted, or an access control changed on an
      existing mailbox so that it is no longer accessible by the user.
      Note that if the mailbox has child mailboxes, only the specified
      mailbox has been deleted, not the children.  The mailbox becomes
      \NOSELECT and the hierarchy remains unchanged, as per the
      description of the DELETE command in RFC 3501IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501].

      The parameters include the deleted mailbox identifier, and may
      also indicate which access protocol triggered the event.

   MailboxRename
      A mailbox has been renamed.  Note that, per the description of the
      RENAME command in RFC 3501IMAP4rev1 [RFC3501], special semantics
      regarding the mailbox hierarchy apply when INBOX is renamed (child
      mailboxes are usually included in the rename, but are excluded
      when INBOX is renamed).  When a mailbox other than INBOX is
      renamed and its child mailboxes are also renamed as a result,
      separate MailboxRename events are not generated for the child
      mailboxes, as their renaming is implied.  If the rename caused the
      creation of new mailboxes earlier in the hierarchy, separate
      MailboxCreate events are not generated for those as their creation
      is implied.  When INBOX is renamed, a new INBOX is created.  A
      MailboxCreate event is not generated for the new INBOX, since it
      is implied.

      The parameters include the old mailbox identifier, the new mailbox
      identifier, and may also indicate which access protocol triggered
      the event.

   MailboxSubscribe
      A mailbox has been added to the subscription list.

      The parameters include the user whose subscription list has been
      affected and the mailbox identifier, and may also indicate which
      access protocol triggered the event.

   MailboxUnSubscribe
      A mailbox has been removed from the subscription list.

      The parameters include the user whose subscription list has been
      affected and the mailbox identifier, and may also indicate which
      access protocol triggered the event.

      Included with QuotaExceed and QuotaWithin notifications relating
      to a user or mailbox message count quota.  May be included with
      other notifications.

      Number of messages in the mailbox.  This is typically included
      with message addition and deletion events.

   modseq

      May be included with any notification referring to one message.

      This is the 64-bit integer MODSEQ as defined in [RFC4551].  No
      assumptions about MODSEQ can be made if this is omitted.

   oldMailboxID

      URI describing the old name of a renamed or moved mailbox.

   pid

      May be included with any notification.

      The process id of the process which generated the notification.

      values include "imap", "pop", "http", "admincli".

   tags

      May be included with any notification.

      This is a comma-separated list of UTF-8 tags.  One or more tags

      subscription is created.  Subscribers can use tags for additional
      client-side filtering or dispatch of events.

   timestamp

      May be included with any notification.

      When the notification was generated in [RFC3339] syntax.

   uidnext

      May be included with any notification referring to a mailbox.

      The UID that is projected to be assigned next in the mailbox.
      This is typically included with message addition and deletion
      events.  This is equivalent to the UIDNEXT status item in the IMAP
      STATUS command.

      events associated with a mailbox, this may be different from the
      owner of the mailbox specified in the IMAP URL.


6.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to create a new registry for "Internet Message
   Store Events" containing two sub-registries: event names and event
   parameters.  For both event names and event parameters, entries which
   do not start with "vnd." are added by the IETF and intended for
   interoperable use.  Entries which start with "vnd." are intended for
   private use by one or more parties and are allocated to avoid
   collisions.

   The initial values are contained in this document.

   Using IANA Considerations [RFC2434] terminology, entries which do not
   start with "vnd." are allocated by IETF Consensus, while those
   starting with "vnd." are allocated First Come First Served.


7.  Security Considerations

   Notifications can produce a large amount of traffic and expose
   sensitive information.  A competent transfer protocol for
   notifications must address authentication, authorization and privacy,
   as well as denial-of-service issues.  While the IETF has adequate
   tools and experience to address these issues for mechanisms which
   involve only one TCP connection, notification or publish/subscribe
   protocols which are more sophisticated than a single end-to-end TCP
   connection will need to pay extra attention to these issues and
   carefully balance requirements to successfully deploy a system with
   security and privacy considerations.

Internet-Draft        Internet Message Store Events            July 2007


Appendix A.  Future Extensions

   The "core" functionality is based on events which are believed to be
   well understood, have known use cases and are implemented by at least
   one deployed real-world Internet message store (FlagsSet and
   FlagsClear are exceptions to the latter test only).

   [[anchor22: have the mailbox admin events been deployed or should
   they be added to the exceptions list?]]

   Some events have been suggested, but are postponed to future
   extensions because they do not meet this criteria.  These events
   include messages which have been moved to archive storage and may
   require extra time to access, quota by message context,
   authentication failure, user mail account disabled, annotations, and
   mailbox ACL or metadata change.  See Section 6 for how the list of
   events and parameters can be extended.

   In order to narrow the scope of this document to something that can
   be completed, only events generated from the message store (by a
   message access module, administrative module or message delivery
   agent) are considered.  A complete mail system is normally linked
   with an identity system which would also publish events of interest
   to a message store event subscriber.  Events of interest include
   account created/deleted/disabled and password changed/expired.
