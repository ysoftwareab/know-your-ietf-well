                 Observations about EAP-NOOB (RFC 9140)
              draft-rieckers-emu-eap-noob-observations-00

Abstract

   This memo is a random list of things the author noticed about EAP-
   NOOB when looking at the draft and running the implementation while
   capturing the packets (https://github.com/Vogeltak/hostap).

   Most of the statements were written down before the author started
   the implementation.  By the time of writing this draft, a mostly
   complete server implementation has been written.  The implementation-
   specific remarks are mostly thoughts the author had while planning
   their own implementation.

2.1.  Why use JSON?

   The author's initial reaction when they first read the draft was: Why
   use JSON and not a binary protocol?  Almost no advantages of using
   JSON (dynamic keys, reordering, flexible and possible deep structure)
   are needed for or used in this protocol, while on the other hand the
   JSON serialization is problematic for the calculation of MAC/Hoob/...
   Especially the need to extract the JSON value of the PeerInfo and
   ServerInfo field may cause problems in the Hash/HMAC calculation, if
   peer and server do not agree on a JSON serialization.

   The protocol has many static parts (always the field "Type", mostly
   fixed parameters depending on the type, ...), so it seems as if the
   number of bytes and the parsing effort could be significantly reduced
   if static protocol messages (e.g. like in the TLS Handshake messages)
   were used.

   If the message format should be more flexible, CBOR seems to be a
   good idea as well.  Here a simple map (best with numbers as keys)
   could be used, combined with deterministic encoding (Section 4.2 of
   [RFC8949]).

2.2.  IANA-Registries

   EAP-NOOB has a striking number of IANA-registered protocol parameters
   with a dedicated IANA registry page only for EAP-NOOB.  At first
   glance this seems a bit odd, since the protocol does not seem to be
   this complex.

   Especially the choice for a designated registry for cryptosuites
   seems odd.  With the current situation, every new curve has to be
   respecified instead of just using existing registries.  This requires
   implementers to update their EAP-NOOB implementation instead of just
   updating the cryptographic library behind it.  The current
   specification specifies only two cryptosuites, which may not be
   feasible for all use cases, especially if higher security levels are
   required.

   As a possible alternative, the COSE algorithms registry provides
   short identifiers for many relevant parameters.

   Another odd thing is the Server-/PeerInfo Registry, see Section 2.4.

2.3.  Unnecessarily long messages

   It seems that the protocol uses an unnecessarily high number of bytes
   to transfer the information.  Though this should not lead to issues
   on the EAP/WPA2 level, it seems that the protocol is not well-suited
   for constrained devices.

   This is especially prominent for the encoding of the ServerInfo and
   PeerInfo fields.  Since the IANA policy is "Specification required",
   shorter identifiers could have been used instead of human-readable
   names, leading to shorter messages.

   The author was also a little confused about the reason why the PeerId
   is always retransmitted.  Other EAP-Methods do just fine without any
   explicit information to identify the exact EAP instance running, so
   it seems a bit odd that the server and the peer keep telling each
   other what the PeerId is.  From the author's understanding, the
   PeerId only has to be transmitted once, either in the first EAP-NOOB
   message from the peer to the server, if the PeerId was assigned in a
   previous EAP-NOOB conversation, or in the second EAP-NOOB message
   from the server to the peer, if a new PeerId has to be allocated.
   The PeerId can then be saved to the current EAP state information.
   This also seems useful to prevent bad implementations where the
   PeerId is not checked every time (since it is always the same
   anyway), but for the calculation of Hoob/..., only the one
   transmitted last is used, which an attacker could have modified.
   However, this is a random thought of how broken implementations could
   be; the author has not yet analyzed the actual attack vector or its
   effects.

   In the server implementation by the author, the PeerId sent by the
   client is ignored in all messages except the aforementioned.

2.4.  Unclear status of ServerInfo and PeerInfo

   The specification is somewhat ambiguous regarding the ServerInfo and
   PeerInfo fields.  Section 3.3.2 of [RFC9140] specifies them as "The
   format and semantics of these objects MUST be defined by the
   application that uses the EAP-NOOB method."  On the other hand,
   specific fields are defined in Section 5.4 and 5.5.  In Section 6.7
   (Channel Binding) the RFC states: "The peer MAY include in PeerInfo
   any data items that it wants to bind to the EAP-NOOB association and
   to the exported keys."

   This is especially interesting for the calculation of Hoob/MACs/
   MACp/... since the PeerInfo and ServerInfo fields are encoded as
   JSON, both the Server and the Peer have to somehow agree on a
   serialization of the JSON object inside.  This could become extremely



Rieckers                Expires 8 September 2022                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            EAP-NOOB observations               March 2022


   tricky once either side sends attributes the other one does not
   expect, e.g. a field with an additional object inside.  Since it is
   JSON and not a JSON-encoded string, the client has to parse the whole
   JSON tree in order to compute the correct Hoob/MACs/MACp/... value.
   Again, this could be easier with other data representation formats.
   With CBOR, the specification could simply use the bytes, which the
   CBOR parser could easily distinguish.  Additionally, [RFC8949]
   specifies a canonical encoding, so both peer and server can generate
   the Hash/HMAC deterministically, even if the implementation only
   saves the content of the fields, not the encoded message.

   Since the IANA registration procedure for PeerInfo/ServerInfo is
   "Specification required", additional use cases for these fields
   cannot easily be added.  For a Masters project at the University of
   Bremen, students are looking into MUD ([RFC8520]), and it would be
   interesting to transmit the MUD URL in the PeerInfo, or the server
   could transmit some initial (public) configuration parameters for the
   device, e.g. the URI for a SmartHome controller.  Since RFC 9140 does
   not specify how to deal with unexpected or unknown fields, this could
   lead to unexpected behavior, if the peer does not understand the
   server's parameters.

2.5.  Number of messages exchanged

   The number of messages exchanged seems to be on the high side.

   For the initial exchange this leads to 4 roundtrips, for the
   reconnect exchange 5 roundtrips, which seems unnecessarily high.
   (The counts given start with the EAP-Response/Identity packet.)

   Let's describe one straightforward way to reduce the number of
   messages needed, primarily for the initial handshake:

   The server could send its supported Versions, Cryptosuites and
   Directions in the first EAP-NOOB message.

   If the peer is in the initial state, in the last message of the
   common handshake, the peer already knows that it wants to negotiate a
   new set of connection parameters, so it could already transmit its
   ECDHE parameters along with the PeerInfo.  If the server had already
   sent its supported versions, cryptosuites and directions, it could
   already choose the suitable methods.

   In the answer the server could then transmit its ServerInfo and its
   ECDHE parameters.  This saves at least one roundtrip.  It also gives
   the server the ability to send different ServerInfo parameters
   depending on the type of the peer device.  This would also enable
   configuration provisioning; for instance, if a light bulb is

   connected, the server could already send the address of the light
   controller to which the bulb should connect to once the EAP-NOOB
   connection is established.  (See previous point on ServerInfo and
   PeerInfo.)

   If the peer is already connected, sending the supported versions and
   cryptosuites in the first message would also give the peer enough
   information to decide whether a renegotiation with a newer version or
   updated cryptographic keys is necessary and could already transmit
   new ECDHE parameters.

   Details of these thoughts have been put into the draft
   [I-D.draft-rieckers-emu-eap-ute].  In this draft, all standard
   exchanges consist of 3 roundtrips.

2.6.  Reconnecting State in state machine

   The existence of the "Reconnecting" state in the state diagram is a
   bit confusing, since the differentiation between Reconnecting and
   Registered State does not serve a further purpose other than to
   determine if the peer is currently connected to a network.  For the
   server, the difference between Reconnecting and Registered state
   should not be relevant at all, since it is never the initiator of the
   EAP conversation.  Once the peer loses its connection, a reconnect
   attempt has to be started anyway, so the peer should never start an
   EAP-NOOB handshake when in state 4 (this behavior is also specified).
   Specifying this state may help with implementation, but it might also
   confuse the implementer.

2.7.  Missing Specification

   RFC 9140 never explicitly specifies which value should be used for
   the Protocol Version field.  Only example values are given in
   Section 3.3.2 for Vers and Verp, from which the version number 1
   could be guessed.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

4.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses a specification that is intended to provide
   security when initiating Internet access.
