Abstract

   This MIB module defines textual conventions to represent commonly
   used Internet network layer addressing information.  The intent is
   that these textual conventions will be imported and used in MIB
   modules that would otherwise define their own representations.

   This document obsoletes RFC 2851.

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses       October 2001


1. Introduction

   Several standard-track MIB modules use the IpAddress SMIv2 base type.
   This limits the applicability of these MIB modules to IP Version 4
   (IPv4) since the IpAddress SMIv2 base type can only contain 4 byte
   IPv4 addresses.  The IpAddress SMIv2 base type has become problematic
   with the introduction of IP Version 6 (IPv6) addresses [19].

   This document defines multiple textual conventions as a mechanism to
   express generic Internet network layer addresses within MIB module
   specifications.  The solution is compatible with SMIv2 (STD 58) and
   SMIv1 (STD 16).  New MIB definitions which need to express network
   layer Internet addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions defined
   in this memo.  New MIB modules SHOULD NOT use the SMIv2 IpAddress
   base type anymore.

   A generic Internet address consists of two objects, one whose syntax
   is InetAddressType, and another whose syntax is InetAddress.  The
   value of the first object determines how the value of the second
   object is encoded.  The InetAddress textual convention represents an
   opaque Internet address value.  The InetAddressType enumeration is
   used to "cast" the InetAddress value into a concrete textual
   convention for the address type.  This usage of multiple textual
   conventions allows expression of the display characteristics of each
   address type and makes the set of defined Internet address types
   extensible.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can also be used to
   represent generic Internet subnets and Internet address ranges.  A
   generic Internet subnet is represented by three objects, one whose
   syntax is InetAddressType, a second one whose syntax is InetAddress
   and a third one whose syntax is InetAddressPrefixLength.  The
   InetAddressType value again determines the concrete format of the
   InetAddress value while the InetAddressPrefixLength identifies the
   Internet network address prefix.

   A generic range of consecutive Internet addresses is represented by
   three objects.  The first one has the syntax InetAddressType while
   the remaining objects have the syntax InetAddress and specify the
   start and end of the address range.  The InetAddressType value again
   determines the format of the InetAddress values.

   The textual conventions defined in this document can be used to
   define Internet addresses by using DNS domain names in addition to
   IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.  A MIB designer can write compliance
   statements to express that only a subset of the possible address
   types must be supported by a compliant implementation.

   MIB developers who need to represent Internet addresses SHOULD use
   these definitions whenever applicable, as opposed to defining their
   own constructs.  Even MIB modules that only need to represent IPv4 or
   IPv6 addresses SHOULD use the textual conventions defined in this
   memo.

   There are many widely deployed MIB modules that use IPv4 addresses
   and which need to be revised to support IPv6.  These MIBs can be
   categorized as follows:

   1.  MIB modules which define management information that is in
       principle IP version neutral, but the MIB currently uses
       addressing constructs specific to a certain IP version.

   2.  MIB modules which define management information that is specific
       to particular IP version (either IPv4 or IPv6) and which is very
       unlikely to be ever applicable to another IP version.

   MIB modules of the first type SHOULD provide object definitions
   (e.g., tables) that work with all versions of IP.  In particular,
   when revising a MIB module which contains IPv4 specific tables, it is
   suggested to define new tables using the textual conventions defined
   in this memo which support all versions of IP.  The status of the new
   tables SHOULD be "current" while the status of the old IP version
   specific tables SHOULD be changed to "deprecated".  The other
   approach of having multiple similar tables for different IP versions
   is strongly discouraged.

   MIB modules of the second type, which are inherently IP version
   specific, do not need to be redefined.  Note that even in this case,
   any additions to these MIB modules or new IP version specific MIB
   modules SHOULD use the textual conventions defined in this memo.

   MIB developers SHOULD NOT use the textual conventions defined in this
   document to represent generic transport layer addresses.  Instead the
   SMIv2 TAddress textual convention and associated definitions should
   be used for transport layer addresses.

   This memo introduces some ordering constraints in order to achieve
   the following two goals:

   1.  Enable programs to identify the InetAddressType object which
       discriminates a certain InetAddress object.  This allows tools
       such as MIB compilers to understand the dependencies and to
       generate code to handle some error conditions.

   2.  Provide some rules that prevent MIB module authors from doing
       certain mistakes which can make future extensions of tables with

       new objects impossible.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [6], STD 58, RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC
      1906 [11].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574
      [13].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [14].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [16].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically



Daniele, et. al.           Expires May 1, 2002                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses       October 2001


   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

            accompanied by a definition of a textual convention for use
            with that InetAddressType.

            To support future extensions, the InetAddressType textual
            convention SHOULD NOT be sub-typed in object type definitions.

            and any dependent objects (e.g. InetAddress objects) are
            consistent.  An inconsistentValue error must be generated
            if an attempt to change an InetAddressType object would,
            for example, lead to an undefined InetAddress value.  In

            which has n contiguous 1-bits from the most significant
            bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

            An InetAddressPrefixLength value is always interpreted
            within the context of an InetAddressType value. The
            InetAddressType object must be registered before the
            object which uses the InetAddressPrefixLength textual
            convention.

            InetAddressPrefixLength values that are larger than
            the maximum length of an IP address for a specific
            InetAddressType are treated as the maximum significant
            value applicable for the InetAddressType. The maximum
            significant value is 32 for the InetAddressType
            'ipv4(1)' and 'ipv4z(3)' and 128 for the InetAddressType
            'ipv6(2)' and 'ipv6z(4)'. The maximum significant value
            for the InetAddressType 'dns(16)' is 0.

            The value zero is object-specific and must be defined as
            part of the description of any object which uses this

4. Usage Hints

   One particular usage of InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs is to avoid
   over-constraining an object definition by the use of the IpAddress
   SMI base type.  An InetAddressType/InetAddress pair allows to
   represent IP addresses in various formats.



Daniele, et. al.           Expires May 1, 2002                 [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses       October 2001


   The InetAddressType and InetAddress objects SHOULD NOT be sub-typed.
   Sub-typing binds the MIB module to specific address formats, which
   may cause serious problems if new address formats need to be
   introduced.  Note that it is possible to write compliance statements
   in order to express that only a subset of the defined address types
   must be implemented to be compliant.

   The InetAddressType object must be registered before the InetAddress
   object(s) or InetAddressPrefixLength object(s).  In other words, the
   object identifiers for the InetAddressType object and the InetAddress
   object MUST have the same length and the last sub-identifier of the
   InetAddressType object MUST be less than the last sub-identifier of
   the InetAddress object.  This rule allows programs such as MIB
   compilers to identify the InetAddressType of a given InetAddress or
   InetAddressPrefixLength object by searching for the InetAddressType
   object which precedes InetAddress or InetAddressPrefixLength
   registration.

4.1 Table Indexing

   When a generic Internet address is used as an index, both the
   InetAddressType and InetAddress objects MUST be used.  The
   InetAddressType object MUST be listed before the InetAddress object
   in the INDEX clause.

   The IMPLIED keyword MUST NOT be used for an object of type
   InetAddress in an INDEX clause.  Instance sub-identifiers are then of
   the form T.N.O1.O2...On, where T is the value of the InetAddressType
   object, O1...On are the octets in the InetAddress object, and N is
   the number of those octets.

   There is a meaningful lexicographical ordering to tables indexed in
   this fashion.  Command generator applications may lookup specific
   addresses of known type and value, issue GetNext requests for
   addresses of a single type, or issue GetNext requests for a specific
   type and address prefix.

4.2 Uniqueness of Addresses

   IPv4 addresses were intended to be globally unique, current usage
   notwithstanding.  IPv6 addresses were architected to have different
   scopes and hence uniqueness [19].  In particular, IPv6 "link-local"
   and "site-local" addresses are not guaranteed to be unique on any
   particular node.  In such cases, the duplicate addresses must be
   configured on different interfaces.  So the combination of an IPv6
   address and a zone index is unique [21].

   The InetAddressIPv6 textual convention has been defined to represent



Daniele, et. al.           Expires May 1, 2002                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     TCs for Internet Network Addresses       October 2001


   global IPv6 address and non-global IPv6 addresses in cases where no
   zone index is needed (e.g., on end hosts with a single interface).
   The InetAddressIPv6z textual convention has been defined to represent
   non-global IPv6 addresses in cases where a zone index is needed
   (e.g., a router connecting multiple zones).  MIB designers who use
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs therefore do not need define
   additional objects in order to support non-global addresses on nodes
   that connect multiple zones.

   The InetAddressIPv4z is intended for use in MIBs (like the TCP-MIB)
   which report addresses in the address family used on the wire, but
   where the entity instrumented obtains such addresses from
   applications or administrators in a form which includes a zone index,
   such as v4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

   The size of the zone index has been chosen so that it is consistent
   with (i) the numerical zone index defined in [21] and (ii) the
   sin6_scope_id field of the sockaddr_in6 structure defined in RFC 2553
   [20].

4.3 Multiple Addresses per Host

   A single host system may be configured with multiple addresses (IPv4
   or IPv6), and possibly with multiple DNS names.  Thus it is possible
   for a single host system to be accessible by multiple
   InetAddressType/InetAddress pairs.

   If this could be an implementation or usage issue, then the
   DESCRIPTION clause of the relevant objects must fully describe which
   address is reported in a given InetAddressType/InetAddress pair.

4.4 Resolving DNS Names

   DNS names must be resolved to IP addresses when communication with
   the named host is required.  This raises a temporal aspect to
   defining MIB objects whose value is a DNS name: When is the name
   translated to an address?

   For example, consider an object defined to indicate a forwarding
   destination, and whose value is a DNS name.  When does the forwarding
   entity resolve the DNS name? Each time forwarding occurs or just once
   when the object was instantiated?

   The DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely define how
   and when any required name to address resolution is done.

   Similarly, the DESCRIPTION clause of such objects SHOULD precisely
   define how and when a reverse lookup is being done if an agent has

   accessed instrumentation that knows about an IP address and the MIB
   module or implementation requires to map the IP address to a DNS
   name.

5. Table Indexing Example

   This example shows a table listing communication peers that are
   identified by either an IPv4 address, an IPv6 address or a DNS name.
   The table definition also prohibits entries with an empty address
   (whose type would be "unknown").  The size of a DNS name is limited
   to 64 characters.

            The peerAddress may not be empty due to the SIZE
            restriction.

            If a row is created administratively by an SNMP
            operation and the address type value is dns(16), then
            the agent stores the DNS name internally. A DNS name
            lookup must be performed on the internally stored DNS
            name whenever it is being used to contact the peer.

            If a row is created by the managed entity itself and
            the address type value is dns(16), then the agent
            stores the IP address internally. A DNS reverse lookup
            must be performed on the internally stored IP address
            whenever the value is retrieved via SNMP."
       ::= { peerEntry 2 }


   The following compliance statement specifies that compliant
   implementations need only support IPv4/IPv6 addresses without a zone
   indices.  Support for DNS names or IPv4/IPv6 addresses with zone
   indices is not required.

   Note that the SMIv2 does not permit inclusion of not-accessible
   objects in an object group (see section 3.1 in STD 58, RFC 2580 [8]).
   It is therefore not possible to formally refine the syntax of
   auxiliary objects which are not-accessible.  In such a case, it is

   suggested to express the refinement informally in the DESCRIPTION
   clause of the MODULE-COMPLIANCE macro invocation.

6. Security Considerations

   This module does not define any management objects.  Instead, it
   defines a set of textual conventions which may be used by other MIB
   modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written in the MIB
   modules that define management objects.  This document has therefore
   no impact on the security of the Internet.

9. Changes from RFC 2851

   The following changes have been made relative to RFC 2851:

   o  Added new textual conventions InetAddressPrefixLength,
      InetPortNumber, and InetAutonomousSystemNumber.

   o  Rewrote the introduction to say clearly that in general, one
      should define MIB tables that work with all versions of IP.  The
      other approach of multiple tables for different IP versions is
      strongly discouraged.  (kzm)

   o  Added text to the InetAddressType and InetAddress descriptions
      which requires that implementations must reject set operations
      with an inconsistentValue error if they lead to inconsistencies.

   o  Relaxed the rules to make it possible to register tuples where
      multiple objects share an InetAddressType value, which is useful
      for filters of the form (InetAddressType, InetAddress,
      InetPortNumber, InetAddress InetPortNumber).

   o  Added a paragraph in the Introduction which explains the
      motivation behind the ordering constraints.

   o  Aligned wordings with the IPv6 scoping architecture document.

   o  Split the InetAddressIPv6 textual convention into the two textual
      conventions (InetAddressIPv6 and InetAddressIPv6z) and introduced
      a new textual convention InetAddressIPv4z.  Added ipv4z(3) and
      ipv6z(4) named numbers to the InetAddressType enumeration.
      Motivations for this change: (i) enable the introduction of a
      textual conventions for non-global IPv4 addresses, (ii) alignment
      with the textual conventions for transport addresses, (iii)
      simpler compliance statements in cases where support for IPv6
      addresses with zone indices is not required, (iv) simplify
      implementations for host systems which will never have to report
      zone indices.
