Internet-Draft         Service Selection for MIPv6         February 2007


1.  Introduction

   Mobile IPv6 [1] has a Mobile Node Identifier option (MN-NAI) [6] that
   provides a flexible way to identify mobile nodes using other
   identifiers than IPv6 addresses.  Example of such identifier is a
   Network Access Identifier (NAI) [2].  Similarly, in some Mobile IPv6
   deployments identifying the mobile node or the mobility service
   subscriber via a proxy representative [7] is not enough to
   distinguish between multiple services possibly provisioned to the
   said mobile node and its mobility service subscription.

   The capability to specify different services in addition to the
   mobile node identity can be leveraged to provide flexibility for
   mobility service providers to provide multiple services within the
   same mobility service subscription.  For example:

   o  Provide an enterprise data access for witch the mobility service
      provider hosts connectivity and mobility services on behalf of the
      enterprise.

   o  Provide access to service domains that are otherwise not
      accessible from public networks because of some mobility service
      provider's business reasons.

   o  Provide simultaneous access to different service domains that are
      separated based on policies of the mobility service provider.

   o  Enable easier policy assignment for mobility service providers
      based on the subscribed services.

   o  In absence of the Service Selection option the home agent may
      provide, based on operator policies, a default service.  For
      example, a plain Internet access could be an operator's default
      mobility service.

   This document describes a Service Selection Mobility Option for
   Mobile IPv6 that is intended to assist home agents to make specific
   service selections for the mobility service subscription during the
   binding update procedure.  The service selection may affect home
   agent routing decisions and Home Address assignment policies.  The
   Service Selection option should be used in combination with the
   Mobile Node Identifier option during the initial Binding Update at
   the beginning of the mobility session.


2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [3].


3.  Service Selection Mobility Option

   The Service Selection mobility option can be included in any Mobile
   IPv6 Mobility Header message.  If the Mobility Header message
   includes any authorization related options (such as the Binding
   Authorization Data option [1]) or authentication related options
   (such as the Mobility Message Authentication option [8]), then the
   Service Selection option MUST appear before any mobility message
   authorization or authentication related options.

   This option MAY be included in the initial Binding Update message
   when registering to a home agent at the beginning of the mobility
   session.  The MN-NAI option SHOULD be included in the Binding Update
   message when the Service Selection option is used.  Sending the
   Service Selection option in any Binding Update message is not
   prohibited.  It should be noted that sending this option to
   correspondent nodes makes little or no sense unless the home agent
   and the correspondent nodes share the same knowledge of provided
   mobility services.

   The Service Selection option has no alignment requirement as such.

   o  Type: 8-bit identifier set to TBD (to be defined by IANA) of the
      type of the mobility option.

   o  Length: 8-bit unsigned integer, representing the length of the
      Service Selection mobility option in octets, excluding the Option
      Type and Option Length fields.

   o  Identifier: A variable length service identifier string used to
      identify the requested service.  The Identifier string is encoded
      as a host name or a fully qualified domain name as defined in [4]
      and [5].

      'deadcoderssociety' and 'deadcoderssociety.example.com' are valid
      examples of Service Selection option Identifier strings.


4.  Processing Considerations

4.1.  Mobile Node Considerations

   A mobile node or its proxy representative MAY include the Service
   Selection mobility option into any Binding Update message.  The
   option is used to identify the service to be associated with the
   mobility session and SHOULD only be included into the initial Binding
   Update message sent to a home agent.  The provisioning of the service
   identifiers to the mobile node or its proxy representative is out of
   scope of this specification.

   The placement of the Service Selection option is as follows: when
   present this option MUST appear after the MN-NAI option and before
   any authorization and authentication related options.  The Service
   Selection option is intended to be used with the MN-NAI option, but
   it is also possible to use Home Address to identify the mobile node
   as defined in [1].

4.2.  Home Agent Considerations

   Upon receiving the Service Selection option the home agent
   authenticates and authorizes the mobile node.  The Service Selection
   option is used to assist the authorization and identifies a specific
   service that is to be authorized.

   The Service Selection option MAY also affect the Home Address
   allocation when for example used with the MN-NAI option.  For the
   same NAI there MAY be different Home Addresses depending on the
   identified service.  Furthermore, the Service Selection option MAY
   also affect the routing of the outbound IP packets in the home agent
   depending on the selected service.

4.3.  Correspondent Node Considerations

   Unless the correspondent node and the home agent share the same
   knowledge about mobility services the Service Selection option is
   more or less useless information to the correspondent node.  The
   correspondent node SHOULD silently ignore the Service Selection

   option.


5.  Security Considerations

   The protection for the Service Selection mobility option depends on
   the service that is being identified and eventually selected.  If the
   service selection information should not be revealed on the wire it
   should be protected in a manner similar to Binding Updates and
   Binding Acknowledgements.


6.  IANA Considerations

   A new Mobile IPv6 Mobility Option type is required for the following
   new mobility option described in Section 3:

       Service Selection Mobility Option       is set to TBD


7.  Acknowledgements

   TBD.
