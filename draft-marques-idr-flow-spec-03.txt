Abstract

   This document defines a new BGP NLRI encoding format that can be used

   to distribute traffic flow specifications.  This allows the routing
   system to propagate information regarding more-specific components of
   the traffic aggregate defined by an IP destination prefix.

   Additionally it defines two applications of that encoding format.
   One that can be used to automate inter-domain coordination of traffic
   filtering, such as what is required in order to mitigate
   (distributed) denial of service attacks.  And a second application to
   traffic filtering in the context of a BGP/MPLS VPN service.

   The information is carried via the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP),
   thereby reusing protocol algorithms, operational experience and
   administrative processes such as inter-provider peering agreements.

1.  Introduction

   Modern IP routers contain both the capability to forward traffic
   according to aggregate IP prefixes as well as the capability to
   identify and special case particular flows of traffic.  The latter
   are usually referred to as access control lists (ACL) or firewall
   engines.

   While forwarding information is, typically, dynamically signaled
   across the network via routing protocols, there is no agreed upon
   mechanism to dynamically signal flows across autonomous-systems.

   For several applications, it may be necessary to exchange control
   information pertaining to aggregated traffic flow definitions which
   cannot be expressed using destination address prefixes only.

   An aggregated traffic flow is considered to be an n-tuple consisting
   of several matching criteria such as source and destination address
   prefixes, IP protocol and transport protocol port numbers.

   The intention of this document is to define a general procedure to
   encode such flow specification rules as a BGP [2] NLRI which can be
   reused for several different control applications.  Additionally, we
   define the required mechanisms to utilize this definition to the
   problem of immediate concern to the authors: intra and inter provider
   distribution of traffic filtering rules to filter (Distributed)
   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

   By expanding routing information with flow specifications, the
   routing system can take advantage of the ACL/firewall capabilities in
   the router's forwarding path.  Flow specifications can be seen as
   more specific routing entries to an unicast prefix and are expected
   to depend upon the existing unicast data information.

   A flow specification received from a external autonomous-system will
   need to be validated against unicast routing before being accepted.
   If the aggregate traffic flow defined by the unicast destination
   prefix is forwarded to a given BGP peer, then the local system can
   safely install more specific flow rules which result in different
   forwarding behavior, as requested by this system.

   The choice of BGP as the carrier of this control information is also
   justifiable by the fact that the key issues in terms of complexity
   are problems which are common to unicast route distribution and have
   already been solved in the current environment.

   From an algorithmic perspective, the main problem that presents
   itself is the loop-free distribution of <key, attribute> pairs from

   one originator to N ingresses.  The key, in this particular instance,
   being a flow specification.

   From an operational perspective, the utilization of BGP as the
   carrier for this information, allows a network service provider to
   reuse both internal route distribution infrastructure (e.g.: route
   reflector or confederation design) and existing external
   relationships (e.g.: inter-domain BGP sessions to a customer
   network).

   While it is certainly possible to address this problem using other
   mechanisms, the authors believe that this solution offers the
   substantial advantage of being an incremental addition to deployed
   mechanisms.

2.  Flow specifications

   A flow specification is an n-tuple consisting on several matching
   criteria that can be applied to IP traffic.  A given IP packet is
   said to match the defined flow if it matches all the specified
   criteria.

   A given flow may be associated with a set of attributes, depending on
   the particular application, such attributes may or may not include
   reachability information (i.e.  NEXT_HOP).  Well-known or AS-specific
   community attributes can be used to encode a set of predeterminate
   actions.

   A particular application is identified by a specific (AFI, SAFI) pair
   [3] and corresponds to a distinct set of RIBs.  Those RIBs should be
   treated independently from each other in order to assure non-
   interference between distinct applications.

   BGP itself treats the NLRI as an opaque key to an entry in its
   databases.  Entries that are placed in the Loc-RIB are then
   associated with a given set of semantics which is application
   dependent.  This is consistent with existing BGP applications.  For
   instance IP unicast routing (AFI=1, SAFI=1) and IP multicast reverse-
   path information (AFI=1, SAFI=2) are handled by BGP without any
   particular semantics being associated with them until installed in
   the Loc-RIB.

   Standard BGP policy mechanisms, such as UPDATE filtering by NLRI
   prefix and community matching, SHOULD apply to the newly defined
   NLRI-type.  Network operators can also control propagation of such
   routing updates by enabling or disabling the exchange of a particular
   (AFI, SAFI) pair on a given BGP peering session.

3.  Dissemination of Information

   We define a "Flow Specification" NLRI type that may include several
   components such as destination prefix, source prefix, protocol,
   ports, etc.  This NLRI is treated as an opaque bit string prefix by
   BGP.  Each bit string identifies a key to a database entry which a
   set of attributes can be associated with.

   This NLRI information is encoded using MP_REACH_NLRI and
   MP_UNREACH_NLRI attributes as defined in RFC2858 [3].  Whenever the
   corresponding application does not require Next Hop information, this
   shall be encoded as a 0 octet length Next Hop in the MP_REACH_NLRI
   attribute and ignored on receipt.

   The NLRI field of the MP_REACH_NLRI and MP_UNREACH_NLRI is encoded as
   a 1 or 2 octet NLRI length field followed by a variable length NLRI
   value.  The NLRI length is expressed in octets.

   +------------------------------+
   |    length (0xnn or 0xfn nn)  |
   +------------------------------+
   |    NLRI value  (variable)    |
   +------------------------------+

   If the NLRI length value is smaller than 240 (0xf0 hex), the length
   field can be encoded as a single octet.  Otherwise, it is encoded as
   a extended length 2 octet value in which the most significant nibble
   of the first byte is all ones.

   The Flow Specification NLRI-type consists of several optional
   subcomponents.  A specific packet is considered to match the flow
   specification when it matches the intersection (AND) of all the
   components present in the specification.

   The following component types are defined:

      Type 1 - Destination Prefix

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), prefix length (1 octet), prefix>

         Defines the destination prefix to match.  Prefixes are encoded
         as in BGP UPDATE messages, a length in bits is followed by
         enough octets to contain the prefix information.

      Type 2 - Source Prefix

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), prefix-length (1 octet), prefix>

Internet-Draft                  flow-spec                    August 2005


         Defines the source prefix to match.

      Type 3 - IP Protocol

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Contains a set of {operator, value} pairs that are used to
         match IP protocol value byte in IP packets.

         The operator byte is encoded as:

                       7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                     | e | a |  len  | 0 |lt |gt |eq |
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

         +  End of List bit.  Set in the last {op, value} pair in the
            list.

         +  And bit.  If unset the previous term is logically ORed with
            the current one.  If set the operation is a logical AND.  It
            should be unset in the first operator byte of a sequence.
            The AND operator has higher priority than OR for the
            purposes of evaluating logical expressions.

         +  The length of value field for this operand is given as (1 <<
            len).

         +  Lt - less than comparison between data and value.

         +  gt - greater than comparison between data and value.

         +  eq - equality between data and value.

         The bits lt, gt, and eq can be combined to produce "less or
         equal", "greater or equal" and inequality values.

      Type 4 - Port

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs that matches source
         OR destination TCP/UDP ports.  This list is encoded using the
         numeric operand format defined above.  Values are encoded as 1
         or 2 byte quantities.

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the
         destination port of a TCP or UDP packet.  Values are encoded as
         1 or 2 byte quantities.

      Type 6 - Source port

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the
         source port of a TCP or UDP packet.  Values are encoded as 1 or
         2 byte quantities.

      Type 7 - ICMP type

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the
         type field of an icmp packet.  Values are encoded using a
         single byte.

      Type 8 - ICMP code

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the
         code field of an icmp packet.  Values are encoded using a
         single byte.

      Type 9 - TCP flags

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, bitmask]+>

         Bitmask values are encoded using a single byte, using the bit
         definitions specified in the TCP header format [1].

         This type uses the bitmask operand format, which differs from
         the numeric operator format in the lower nibble.

                       7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

         +  Top nibble: (End of List bit, And bit and Length field), as
            defined for in the numeric operator format.

         +  Not bit.  If set, logical negation of operation.

         +  Match bit.  If set this is a bitwise match operation defined
            as "(data & value) == value"; if unset (data & value)
            evaluates to true if and of the bits in the value mask are
            set in the data.

      Type 10 - Packet length

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Match on the total IP packet length (excluding L2 but including
         IP header).  Values are encoded using as 1 or 2 byte
         quantities.

      Type 11 - DSCP

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, value]+>

         Defines a list of {operation, value} pairs used to match the IP
         TOS octet.

      Type 12 - Fragment

         Encoding: <type (1 octet), [op, bitmask]+>

         Uses bitmask operand format defined above.

         Bitmask values:

         +  Bit 0 - Dont fragment

         +  Bit 1 - Is a fragment

         +  Bit 2 - First fragment

         +  Bit 3 - Last fragment

   Flow specification components must follow strict type ordering.  A
   given component type may or may not be present in the specification,
   but if present it MUST precede any component of higher numeric type
   value.

   If a given component type within a prefix in unknown, the prefix in
   question cannot be used for traffic filtering purposes by the

   receiver.  Since a Flow Specification as the semantics of a logical
   AND of all components, if a component is FALSE by definition it
   cannot be applied.  However for the purposes of BGP route propagation
   this prefix should still be transmitted since BGP route distribution
   is independent on NLRI semantics.

   Flow specification components are to be interpreted as a bit match at
   a given packet offset.  When more than one component in a flow
   specification tests the same packet offset the behavior is
   undetermined.

   The <type, value> encoding is chosen in order to account for future
   extensibility.

4.  Traffic filtering

   Traffic filtering policies have been traditionally considered to be
   relatively static.

   The popularity of traffic-based denial of service (DoS) attacks,
   which often requires the network operator to be able to use traffic
   filters for detection and mitigation, brings with it requirements
   that are not fully satisfied by existing tools.

   Increasingly, DoS mitigation, requires coordination among several
   Service Providers, in order to be able to identify traffic source(s)
   and because the volumes of traffic may be such that they will
   otherwise significantly affect the performance of the network.

   Several techniques are currently used to control traffic filtering of
   DoS attacks.  Among those, one of the most common is to inject
   unicast route advertisements corresponding to a destination prefix
   being attacked.  One variant of this technique marks such route
   advertisements with a community that gets translated into a discard
   next-hop by the receiving router.  Other variants, attract traffic to
   a particular node that serves as a deterministic drop point.

   Using unicast routing advertisements to distribute traffic filtering
   information has the advantage of using the existing infrastructure
   and inter-as communication channels.  This can allow, for instance,
   for a service provider to accept filtering requests from customers
   for address space they own.

   There are several drawbacks, however.  An issue that is immediately
   apparent is the granularity of filtering control: only destination
   prefixes may be specified.  Another area of concern is the fact that
   filtering information is intermingled with routing information.

   The mechanism defined in this document is designed to address these
   limitations.  We use the flow specification NLRI defined above to
   convey information about traffic filtering rules for traffic that
   should be discarded.

   This mechanism is designed to, primarily, allow an upstream
   autonomous system to perform inbound filtering, in their ingress
   routers of traffic that a given downstream AS wishes to drop.

   In order to achieve that goal, we define an application specific NLRI
   identifier (AFI=1, SAFI=133) along with specific semantic rules.

   BGP routing updates containing this identifier use the flow
   specification NLRI encoding to convey particular aggregated flows

   that require special treatment.

   Flow routing information received via this (afi, safi) pair is
   subject to the validation procedure detailed bellow.

4.1.  Order of traffic filtering rules

   With traffic filtering rules, more than one rule may match a
   particular traffic flow.  Thus it is necessary to define the order at
   which rules get matched and applied to a particular traffic flow.
   This ordering function must be such that it must not depend on the
   arrival order of the flow specifications rules and must be constant
   in the network.

   We choose to order traffic filtering rules such that the order of two
   flow specifications is given by the comparison of NLRI key byte
   strings as defined by the memcmp() function is the ISO C standard.

   Given the way that flow specifications are encoded this results in a
   flow with a less-specific destination IP prefix being considered
   less-than (and thus match before) a flow specification with a more-
   specific destination IP prefix.

   This matches an application model where the user may want to define a
   restriction that affects an aggregate of traffic and a subsequent
   rule that applies only to a subset of that.

   A flow-specification without a destination IP prefix is considered to
   match after all flow-specifications that contain an IP destination
   prefix.

5.  Validation procedure

   Flow specifications received from a BGP peer and which are accepted
   in the respective Adj-RIB-In are used as input to the route selection
   process.  Although the forwarding attributes of two routes for the
   same Flow Specification prefix may be the same, BGP is still required
   to perform its path selection algorithm in order to select the
   correct set of attributes to advertise.

   The first step of the BGP Route Selection procedure (section 9.1.2)
   is to exclude from the selection procedure routes that are considered
   non-feasible.  In the context of IP routing information this step is
   used to validate that the NEXT_HOP attribute of a given route is
   resolvable.

   The concept can be extended, in the case of Flow Specification NLRI,
   to allow other validation procedures.

   A flow specification NLRI must be validated such that it is
   considered feasible if and only if:

   a) The originator of the flow specification matches the originator of
      the best-match unicast route for the destination prefix embedded
      in the flow specification.

   b) There are no more-specific unicast routes, when compared with the
      flow destination prefix, that have been received by a different
      neighboring AS than the best-match unicast route, which has been
      determined in step a).

   By originator of a BGP route, we mean either the BGP originator path
   attribute, as used by route reflection, or the transport address of
   the BGP peer, if this path attribute is not present.

   The underlying concept is that the neighboring AS that advertises the
   best unicast route for a destination is allowed to advertise flow-
   spec information that conveys a less or equally specific destination
   prefix.  This, as long as there are no more-specific unicast routes,
   received from a different neighbor AS, which would be affected by
   that filtering rule.

   The neighboring AS is the immediate destination of the traffic
   described by the Flow Specification.  If it requests these flows to
   be dropped that request can be honored without concern that it
   represents a denial of service in itself.  Supposedly, the traffic is
   being dropped by the downstream autonomous-system and there is no
   added value in carrying the traffic to it.

6.  Traffic Filtering Actions

   This specification defines a minimum set of filtering actions that it
   standardizes as BGP extended community values [4].  This is not ment
   to be an inclusive list of all the possible actions but only a subset
   that can be interpreted consistently across the network.

   Implementations should provide mechanisms that map an arbitrary bgp
   community value (normal or extended) to filtering actions that
   require different mappings in different systems in the network.  For
   instance, providing packets with a worse than best-effort per-hop
   behavior is a functionality that is likely to be implemented
   differently in different systems and for which no standard behavior
   is currently known.  Rather than attempting to define it here, this
   can be accomplished by mapping a user defined community value to
   platform / network specific behavior via user configuration.

   The default action for a traffic filtering flow specification is to
   accept IP traffic that matches that particular rule.

      The following extended community values can be used to specify
                            particular actions.

        +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
        | type   | extended community | encoding                 |
        +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+
        | 0x8006 | traffic-rate       | 2-byte as#, 4-byte float |
        |        |                    |                          |
        | 0x8007 | traffic-action     | bitmask                  |
        |        |                    |                          |
        | 0x8008 | redirect           | 6-byte Route Target      |
        +--------+--------------------+--------------------------+

   Traffic-rate

      The traffic-rate extended community uses the same encoding as the
      "Link Bandwidth" [4] extended community.  The rate is is expressed
      as 4 octets in IEEE floating point format, units being bytes per
      second.  A traffic-rate of 0 should result on all traffic for the
      particular flow to be discarded.

   Traffic-action

      The traffic-action extended community consists of 6 bytes of which
      only the 2 least significant bits of the 6th byte (from left to
      right) are currently defined.

      *  Terminal action (bit 0).  When this bit is set the traffic
         filtering engine will apply any subsequent filtering rules (as
         defined by the ordering procedure).  If not set the evaluation
         of the traffic filter stops when this rule is applied.

      *  Sample (bit 1).  Enables traffic sampling and logging for this
         flow specification.

   Redirect

      The redirect extended community allows the traffic to be
      redirected to a VRF routing instance that list the specified
      route-target in its import policy.  If several local instances
      match this criteria, the choice between them is a local matter
      (for example, the instance with the lowest Route Distinguisher
      value can be elected).  The traffic marking extended community
      instruct a system to modify the DSCP bits of a transiting IP
      packet to the corresponding value.  This extended community is
      encoded as a sequence of 5 zero bytes followed by the DSCP value.

7.  Traffic filtering in RFC2547bis networks

   Provider-based layer 3 VPN networks, such as the ones using an BGP/
   MPLS IP VPN [5] control plane, have different traffic filtering
   requirements than internet service providers.

   In these environments, the VPN customer network often has traffic
   filtering capabilities towards their external network connections
   (e.g. firewall facing public network connection).  Less common is the
   presence of traffic filtering capabilities between different VPN
   attachment sites.  In an any-to-any connectivity model, which is the
   default, this means that site to site traffic is unfiltered.

   In circumstances where a security threat does get propagated inside
   the VPN customer network, there may not be readily available
   mechanisms to provide mitigation via traffic filter.

   This document proposes an additional BGP NLRI type (afi=1, safi=134)
   value, which can be used to propagate traffic filtering information
   in a BGP/MPLS VPN environment.

   The NLRI format for this address family consists of a fixed length
   Route Distinguisher field (8 bytes) followed by a flow specification,
   following the encoded defined in this document.  The NLRI length
   field shall includes the both 8 bytes of the Route Distinguisher as
   well as the subsequent flow specification.

   Propagation of this NLRI is controlled by matching Route Target
   extended communities associated with the BGP path advertisement with
   the VRF import policy, using the same mechanism as described in "BGP/
   MPLS IP VPNs" [5] .

   Flow specification rules received via this NLRI apply only to traffic
   that belongs to the VRF(s) in which it is imported.  By default,
   traffic received from a remote PE is switched via an mpls forwarding
   decision and is not subject to filtering.

   Contrary to the behavior specified for the non-VPN NLRI, flow rules
   are accepted by default, when received from remote PE routers.

8.  Monitoring

   Traffic filtering applications require monitoring and traffic
   statistics facilities.  While this is an implementation specific
   choice, implementations SHOULD provide:

   o  A mechanism to log the packet header of filtered traffic,

   o  A mechanism to count the number of matches for a given Flow
      Specification rule.

9.  Security considerations

   Inter-provider routing is based on a web of trust.  Neighboring
   autonomous-systems are trusted to advertise valid reachability
   information.  If this trust model is violated, a neighboring
   autonomous system may cause a denial of service attack by advertising
   reachability information for a given prefix for which it does not
   provide service.

   As long as traffic filtering rules are restricted to match the
   corresponding unicast routing paths for the relevant prefixes, the
   security characteristics of this proposal are equivalent to the
   existing security properties of BGP unicast routing.

   Where it not the case, this would open the door to further denial of
   service attacks.
