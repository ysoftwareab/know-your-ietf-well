                    MVPN and MSDP SA Interoperation
             draft-ietf-bess-mvpn-msdp-sa-interoperation-08

Abstract

   This document specifies the procedures for interoperation between
   Multicast Virtual Private Network (MVPN) Source Active routes and
   customer Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) Source Active
   routes, which is useful for MVPN provider networks offering services
   to customers with an existing MSDP infrastructure.  Without the
   procedures described in this document, VPN-specific MSDP sessions are
   required among the PEs that are customer MSDP peers.  This document
   updates RFC6514.

1.  Terminologies

   Familiarity with MVPN [RFC6513] [RFC6514] and MSDP [RFC3618]
   protocols and procedures is assumed.  Some terminologies are listed
   below for convenience.

   o  ASM: Any source multicast.

   o  SPT: Source-specific Shortest-path Tree.

   o  RPT: Rendezvous Point Tree.

   o  C-S: A multicast source address, identifying a multicast source
      located at a VPN customer site.

   o  C-G: A multicast group address used by a VPN customer.

   o  C-RP: A multicast Rendezvous Point for a VPN customer.

   o  C-Multicast: Multicast for a VPN customer.

   o  EC: Extended Community.

   o  GTM: Global Table Multicast, i.e., multicast in the default or
      global routing table vs. VRF table.

2.  Introduction

   Section "14.  Supporting PIM-SM without Inter-Site Shared C-Trees" of
   [RFC6514] specifies the procedures for MVPN PEs to discover (C-S,C-G)
   via MVPN Source Active A-D routes and then send Source Tree Join
   (C-S,C-G) C-multicast routes towards the ingress PEs, to establish
   SPTs for customer ASM flows for which they have downstream receivers.
   (C-*,C-G) C-multicast routes are not sent among the PEs so inter-site
   shared C-Trees are not used and the method is generally referred to
   as "spt-only" mode.

   With this mode, the MVPN Source Active routes are functionally
   similar to MSDP Source-Active messages.  For a VPN, one or more of
   the PEs, say PE1, either acts as a C-RP and learns of (C-S,C-G) via
   PIM Register messages, or has MSDP sessions with some MSDP peers and
   learn (C-S,C-G) via MSDP SA messages.  In either case, PE1 will then
   originate MVPN SA routes for other PEs to learn the (C-S,C-G).

   [RFC6514] only specifies that a PE receiving the MVPN SA routes, say
   PE2, will advertise Source Tree Join (C-S,C-G) C-multicast routes if
   it has corresponding (C-*,C-G) state learnt from its CE.  PE2 may
   also have MSDP sessions for the VPN with other C-RPs at its site, but
   [RFC6514] does not specify that PE2 advertises MSDP SA messages to
   those MSDP peers for the (C-S,C-G) that it learns via MVPN SA routes.
   PE2 would need to have an MSDP session with PE1 (that advertised the
   MVPN SA messages) to learn the sources via MSDP SA messages, for it
   to advertise the MSDP SA to its local peers.  To make things worse,
   unless blocked by policy control, PE2 would in turn advertise MVPN SA
   routes because of those MSDP SA messages that it receives from PE1,
   which are redundant and unnecessary.  Also notice that the PE1-PE2
   MSDP session is VPN-specific (i.e., only for a single VPN), while the
   BGP sessions over which the MVPN routes are advertised are not.

   If a PE does advertise MSDP SA messages based on received MVPN SA
   routes, the VPN-specific MSDP sessions with other PEs are no longer
   needed.  Additionally, this MVPN/MSDP SA interoperation has the
   following inherent benefits for a BGP based solution.

   o  MSDP SA refreshes are replaced with BGP hard state.

   o  Route Reflectors can be used instead of having peer-to-peer
      sessions.

   o  VPN Extranet [RFC2764] mechanisms can be used to propagate
      (C-S,C-G) information across VPNs with flexible policy control.

   While MSDP Source Active routes contain the source, group and RP
   addresses of a given multicast flow, MVPN Source Active routes only
   contain the source and group.  MSDP requires the RP address
   information in order to perform MSDP peer-RPF.  Therefore, this
   document describes how to convey the RP address information into the
   MVPN Source Active route using an Extended Community so this
   information can be shared with an existing MSDP infrastructure.

   The procedures apply to Global Table Multicast (GTM) [RFC7716] as
   well.

2.1.  MVPN RPT-SPT Mode

   For comparison, another method of supporting customer ASM is
   generally referred to as "rpt-spt" mode.  Section "13.  Switching
   from a Shared C-Tree to a Source C-Tree" of [RFC6514] specifies the
   MVPN SA procedures for that mode, but those SA routes are a
   replacement for PIM-ASM assert and (s,g,rpt) prune mechanisms, not
   for source discovery purposes.  MVPN/MSDP SA interoperation for the
   "rpt-spt" mode is outside the scope of this document.  In the rest of
   the document, the "spt-only" mode is assumed.

3.  Specification

   The MVPN PEs that act as customer RPs or have one or more MSDP
   sessions in a VPN (or the global table in case of GTM) are treated as
   an MSDP mesh group for that VPN (or the global table).  In the rest
   of the document, it is referred to as the PE mesh group.  This PE
   mesh group MUST NOT include other MSDP speakers, and is integrated
   into the rest of MSDP infrastructure for the VPN (or the global
   table) following normal MSDP rules and practices.

   When an MVPN PE advertises an MVPN SA route following procedures in
   [RFC6514] for the "spt-only" mode, it MUST attach an "MVPN SA RP-
   address Extended Community".  This is a Transitive IPv4-Address-
   Specific Extended Community.  The Local Administrative field is set
   to zero and the Global Administrative field is set to an RP address
   determined as the following:

   o  If the (C-S,C-G) is learnt as result of PIM Register mechanism,
      the local RP address for the C-G is used.

Internet-Draft                mvpn-sa-msdp                      May 2021


   o  If the (C-S,C-G) is learnt as result of incoming MSDP SA messages,
      the RP address in the selected MSDP SA message is used.

   In addition to procedures in [RFC6514], an MVPN PE may be provisioned
   to generate MSDP SA messages from received MVPN SA routes, with or
   without local policy control.  If a received MVPN SA route triggers
   an MSDP SA message, the MVPN SA route is treated as if a
   corresponding MSDP SA message was received from within the PE mesh
   group and normal MSDP procedure is followed (e.g. an MSDP SA message
   is advertised to other MSDP peers outside the PE mesh group).  The
   (S,G) information comes from the (C-S,C-G) encoding in the MVPN SA
   NLRI and the RP address comes from the "MVPN SA RP-address EC"
   mentioned above.  If the received MVPN SA route does not have the EC
   (this could be from a legacy PE that does not have the capability to
   attach the EC), the local RP address for the C-G is used.  In that
   case, it is possible that the RP inserted into the MSDP SA message
   for the C-G is actually the MSDP peer to which the generated MSDP
   message is advertised, causing the peer to discard it due to RPF
   failure.  To get around that problem the peer SHOULD use local policy
   to accept the MSDP SA message.

   An MVPN PE MAY treat only the best MVPN SA route selected by the BGP
   route selection process (instead of all MVPN SA routes) for a given
   (C-S,C-G) as a received MSDP SA message (and advertise the
   corresponding MSDP message).  In that case, if the selected best MVPN
   SA route does not have the "MVPN SA RP-address EC" but another route
   for the same (C-S, C-G) does, then the next best route with the EC
   SHOULD be chosen.  As a result, when/if the best MVPN SA route with
   the EC changes, a new MSDP SA message is advertised if the RP address
   determined according to the newly selected MVPN SA route is different
   from before.  The MSDP SA state associated with the previously
   advertised MSDP SA message with the older RP address will be timed
   out.

4.  Security Considerations

   RFC6514 specifies the procedure for a PE to generate an MVPN SA upon
   discovering a (C-S,C-G) flow (e.g. via a received MSDP SA message) in
   a VPN.  This document extends this capability in the reverse
   direction - upon receiving an MVPN SA route in a VPN generate a
   corresponding MSDP SA and advertise it to MSDP peers in the same VPN.
   As such, the capabilities specified in this document introduce no
   additional security considerations beyond those already specified in
   RFC6514 and RFC3618.  Moreover, the capabilities specified in this
   document actually eliminate the control message amplification that
   exists today where VPN-specific MSDP sessions are required among the
   PEs that are customer MSDP peers, which lead to redundant messages
   (MSDP SAs and MVPN SAs) being carried in parallel between PEs.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces a new Transitive IPv4 Address Specific
   Extended Community "MVPN SA RP-address Extended Community".  IANA has
   registered subcode 0x20 in the Transitive IPv4-Address-Specific
   Extended Community Sub-Types registry for this EC.
