1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path

Internet-Draft                  PCE-YANG                      March 2019


   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   PCEP is the communication protocol between a PCC and PCE and is
   defined in [RFC5440].  PCEP interactions include path computation
   requests and path computation replies as well as notifications of
   specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   Traffic Engineering (TE).  [RFC8231] specifies extensions to PCEP to
   enable stateful control of MPLS TE LSPs.

   This document defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the management
   of PCEP speakers.  It is important to establish a common data model
   for how PCEP speakers are identified, configured, and monitored.  The
   data model includes configuration data and state data.

   This document contains a specification of the PCEP YANG module,
   "ietf-pcep" which provides the PCEP [RFC5440] data model.

   The PCEP operational state is included in the same tree as the PCEP
   configuration consistent with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture [RFC8342].  The origin of the data is indicated as per
   the origin metadata annotation.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology and Notation

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC4655] and
   [RFC5440].  In particular, it uses the following acronyms.

   o  Path Computation Request message (PCReq).

   o  Path Computation Reply message (PCRep).

   o  Notification message (PCNtf).

   o  Error message (PCErr).

   o  Request Parameters object (RP).

   o  Explicit Route object (ERO).

   This document also uses the following terms defined in [RFC7420]:

   o  PCEP entity: a local PCEP speaker.

   o  PCEP peer: to refer to a remote PCEP speaker.

   o  PCEP speaker: where it is not necessary to distinguish between
      local and remote.

   Further, this document also uses the following terms defined in
   [RFC8231] :

   o  Stateful PCE, Passive Stateful PCE, Active Stateful PCE

   o  Delegation, Revocation, Redelegation

   o  LSP State Report, Path Computation Report message (PCRpt).

   o  LSP State Update, Path Computation Update message (PCUpd).

   o  PCE-initiated LSP, Path Computation LSP Initiate Message
      (PCInitiate).

   [RFC8408] :

   o  Path Setup Type (PST).

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing] :

   o  Segment Routing (SR).

   [RFC6241] :

   o  Configuration data.

   o  State data.

3.1.  Tree Diagrams

3.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from the
   context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise, names
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

4.  Objectives

   This section describes some of the design objectives for the model:

   o  In case of existing implementations, it needs to map the data
      model defined in this document to their proprietary native data
      model.  To facilitate such mappings, the data model should be
      simple.

   o  The data model should be suitable for new implementations to use
      as is.

   o  Mapping to the PCEP MIB Module should be clear.

   o  The data model should allow for static configurations of peers.

   o  The data model should include read-only counters in order to
      gather statistics for sent and received PCEP messages, received
      messages with errors, and messages that could not be sent due to
      errors.  This could be in a separate model which augments the base
      data model.

   o  It should be fairly straightforward to augment the base data model
      for advanced PCE features.

5.  The Design of PCEP Data Model

5.1.  The Overview of PCEP Data Model

   The PCEP YANG module defined in this document has all the common
   building blocks for the PCEP protocol.

   module: ietf-pcep
       +--rw pcep!
          +--rw entity
             +--rw addr                          inet:ip-address

       +---x trigger-resync {stateful,stateful-sync-opt}?
          +---w input
             +---w pcc?   -> /pcep/entity/peers/peer/addr

     notifications:
       +---n pcep-session-up
       |  ...
       +---n pcep-session-down
       |  ...

          ...

5.2.  The Entity

   The PCEP yang module may contain status information for the local
   PCEP entity.

   The entity has an IP address (using ietf-inet-types [RFC6991]) and a
   "role" leaf (the local entity PCEP role) as mandatory.

   Note that, the PCEP MIB module [RFC7420] uses an entity list and a
   system generated entity index as a primary index to the read only
   entity table.  If the device implements the PCEP MIB, the "index"
   leaf MUST contain the value of the corresponding pcePcepEntityIndex
   and only one entity is assumed.

5.3.  The Peer Lists

   The peer list contains peer(s) that the local PCEP entity knows
   about.  A PCEP speaker is identified by its IP address.  If there is
   a PCEP speaker in the network that uses multiple IP addresses then it
   looks like multiple distinct peers to the other PCEP speakers in the
   network.

   Since PCEP sessions can be ephemeral, the peer list tracks a peer
   even when no PCEP session currently exists to that peer.  The
   statistics contained are an aggregate of the statistics for all
   successive sessions to that peer.

   To limit the quantity of information that is stored, an
   implementation MAY choose to discard this information if and only if
   no PCEP session exists to the corresponding peer.

   The data model for PCEP peer presented in this document uses a flat
   list of peers.  Each peer in the list is identified by its IP address
   (addr-type, addr).

   There is a list for static peer configuration and operational state
   of all peers (i.e.static as well as discovered)("/pcep/entity/
   peers").  The list is used to enable remote PCE configuration at PCC
   (or PCE) and has the operational state of these peers as well as the
   remote PCE peer which were discovered and PCC peers that have
   initiated session.

5.4.  The Session Lists

   The session list contains PCEP session that the PCEP entity (PCE or
   PCC) is currently participating in.  The statistics in session are
   semantically different from those in peer since the former applies to
   the current session only, whereas the latter is the aggregate for all
   sessions that have existed to that peer.

   Although [RFC5440] forbids more than one active PCEP session between
   a given pair of PCEP entities at any given time, there is a window
   during session establishment where two sessions may exist for a given
   pair, one representing a session initiated by the local PCEP entity
   and the other representing a session initiated by the peer.  If
   either of these sessions reaches active state first, then the other
   is discarded.

   The data model for PCEP session presented in this document uses a
   flat list of sessions.  Each session in the list is identified by its
   initiator.  This index allows two sessions to exist transiently for a
   given peer, as discussed above.

5.5.  Notifications

   This YANG model defines a list of notifications to inform client of
   important events detected during the protocol operation.  The
   notifications defined cover the PCEP MIB notifications.

5.6.  RPC

   This YANG model defines a RPC to trigger state resynchronization to a
   particular PCEP peer.

5.7.  The Full PCEP Data Model

   The module, "ietf-pcep", defines the basic components of a PCE
   speaker.  The tree depth in the tree is set to 10.

7.  Advanced PCE Features

   This document contains a specification of the base PCEP YANG module,
   "ietf-pcep" which provides the basic PCEP [RFC5440] data model.

   This document further handles advanced PCE features like -

   o  Capability and Scope

   o  Domain information (local/neighbour)

   o  Path-Key

   o  OF

   o  GCO

   o  P2MP

   o  GMPLS

   o  Inter-Layer

   o  Stateful PCE

   o  Segement Routing

   o  Authentication including PCEPS (TLS)

7.1.  Stateful PCE's LSP-DB

   In the operational state of PCEP which supports stateful PCE mode,
   the list of LSP state are maintained in LSP-DB.  The key is the PLSP-
   ID and the PCC IP address.

   The PCEP data model contains the operational state of LSPs
   (/pcep/entity/lsp-db/lsp/) with PCEP specific attributes.  The
   generic TE attributes of the LSP are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  A reference to LSP state in TE model is
   maintained.

8.  Open Issues and Next Step

   This section is added so that open issues can be tracked.  This
   section would be removed when the document is ready for publication.

8.1.  The PCE-Initiated LSP

   The TE Model at [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te] should support creating of
   tunnels at the controller (PCE) and marking them as PCE-Initiated.
   The LSP-DB in the PCEP Yang (/pcep/entity/lsp-db/lsp/initiation) also
   marks the LSPs which are PCE-initiated.

9.  Other Considerations

9.1.  PCEP over TLS (PCEPS)

   [RFC8253] describe the use of TLS in PCEP.  The peer acting as the
   PCEP client MUST act as the TLS client.  The TLS client actively
   opens the TLS connection and the TLS server passively listens for the
   incoming TLS connections.  The well-known TCP port number 4189 is
   used by PCEP servers to listen for TCP connections established by
   PCEP over TLS clients.  The TLS client MUST send the TLS ClientHello
   message to begin the TLS handshake.  The TLS server MUST send a
   CertificateRequest in order to request a certificate from the TLS
   client.  Once the TLS handshake has finished, the client and the
   server MAY begin to exchange PCEP messages.  Client and server
   identity verification is done before the PCEP open message is sent.
   This means that the identity verification is completed before the
   PCEP session is started..

11.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocol such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is SSH [RFC6242].
   The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is TLS [RFC8446]

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /pcep/entity/ - configure local parameters, capabilities etc.

      /pcep/entity/peers - configure remote peers to setup PCEP session.

   Unauthorized access to above list can adversely affect the PCEP
   session between the local entity and the peers.  This may lead to
   inability to compute new paths, stateful operations on the delegated
   as well as PCE-initiated LSPs.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /pcep/lsp-db - All the LSPs in the network.  Unauthorized access
      to this could provide the all path and network usage information.

      /pcep/path-keys/ - The Confidential Path Segments (CPS) are hidden
      using path-keys.  Unauthorized access to this could leak
      confidential path information.

   Some of the RPC operations in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus

   important to control access to these operations.  These are the
   operations and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      trigger-resync - trigger resynchronization with the PCE.
      Unauthorized access to this could force a PCEP session into
      continuous state synchronization.

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the "IETF XML Registry" [RFC3688].
