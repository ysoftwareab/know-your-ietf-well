2.  Introduction

   RFC 7432 specifies procedures to handle broadcast, unknown unicast,
   and multicast (BUM) traffic in Section 11, 12 and 16, using Inclusive
   Multicast Ethernet Tag Route.  A lot of details are referred to RFC
   7117 (VPLS Multicast).  In particular, selective multicast is briefly
   mentioned for Ingress Replication but referred to RFC 7117.

   RFC 7117 specifies procedures for using both inclusive tunnels and
   selective tunnels, similar to MVPN procedures specified in RFC 6513
   and RFC 6514.  A new SAFI "MCAST-VPLS" is introduced, with two types
   of NLRIs that match MVPN's S-PMSI A-D routes and Leaf A-D routes.
   The same procedures can be applied to EVPN selective multicast for
   both Ingress Replication and other tunnel types, but new route types
   need to be defined under the same EVPN SAFI.

   MVPN uses terms I-PMSI and S-PMSI A-D Routes.  For consistency and
   convenience, this document will use the same I/S-PMSI terms for VPLS
   and EVPN.  In particular, EVPN's Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag
   Route and VPLS's VPLS A-D route carrying PTA (PMSI Tunnel Attribute)
   for BUM traffic purpose will all be referred to as I-PMSI A-D routes.
   Depending on the context, they may be used interchangeably.

   MVPN provider tunnels and EVPN/VPLS BUM provider tunnels, which are
   referred to as MVPN/EVPN/VPLS provider tunnels in this document for
   simplicity, can be segmented for technical or administrative reasons,
   which are summarized in Section 2.1 of this document.  RFC 6513/6514
   cover MVPN inter-as segmentation, RFC 7117 covers VPLS multicast
   inter-as segmentation, and RFC 7524 (Seamless MPLS Multicast) covers
   inter-area segmentation for both MVPN and VPLS.

   There is a difference between MVPN and VPLS multicast inter-as
   segmentation.  For simplicity, EVPN uses the same procedures as in
   MVPN.  All ASBRs can re-advertise their choice of the best route.
   Each can become the root of its intra-AS segment and inject traffic
   it receives from its upstream, while each downstream PE/ASBR will
   only pick one of the upstream ASBRs as its upstream.  This is also
   the behavior even for VPLS in case of inter-area segmentation.

   For inter-area segmentation, RFC 7524 requires the use of Inter-area
   P2MP Segmented Next-Hop Extended Community (S-NH-EC), and the setting
   of "Leaf Information Required" (LIR) flag in PTA in certain
   situations.  Either of these could be optional in case of EVPN.
   Removing these requirements would make the segmentation procedures
   transparent to ingress and egress PEs.

   RFC 7524 assumes that segmentation happens at area borders.  However,
   it could be at "regional" borders, where a region could be a sub-

   area, or even an entire AS plus its external links (Section 6).  That
   would allow for more flexible deployment scenarios (e.g. for single-
   area provider networks).

   This document specifies/clarifies/redefines certain/additional EVPN
   BUM procedures, with a salient goal that they're better aligned among
   MVPN, EVPN and VPLS.  For brevity, only changes/additions to relevant
   RFC 7117 and RFC 7524 procedures are specified, instead of repeating
   the entire procedures.  Note that these are to be applied to EVPN
   only, even though sometimes they may sound to be updates to RFC
   7117/7524.

2.1.  Reasons for Tunnel Segmentation

   Tunnel segmentation may be required and/or desired because of
   administrative and/or technical reasons.

   For example, an MVPN/VPLS/EVPN network may span multiple providers
   and Inter-AS Option-B has to be used, in which the end-to-end
   provider tunnels have to be segmented at and stitched by the ASBRs.
   Different providers may use different tunnel technologies (e.g.,
   provider A uses Ingress Replication, provider B uses RSVP-TE P2MP
   while provider C uses mLDP).  Even if they use the same tunnel
   technology like RSVP-TE P2MP, it may be impractical to set up the
   tunnels across provider boundaries.

   The same situations may apply between the ASes and/or areas of a
   single provider.  For example, the backbone area may use RSVP-TE P2MP
   tunnels while non-backbone areas may use mLDP tunnels.

   Segmentation can also be used to divide an AS/area to smaller
   regions, so that control plane state and/or forwarding plane state/
   burden can be limited to that of individual regions.  For example,
   instead of Ingress Replicating to 100 PEs in the entire AS, with
   inter-area segmentation [RFC 7524] a PE only needs to replicate to
   local PEs and ABRs.  The ABRs will further replicate to their
   downstream PEs and ABRs.  This not only reduces the forwarding plane
   burden, but also reduces the leaf tracking burden in the control
   plane.  This inter-region segmentation can be further extended to
   intra-region as an alternative way to achieve Assisted Replication as
   proposed in [draft-rabadan-bess-evpn-optimized-ir], and it works for
   MPLS encapsulation.

   Smaller regions also have the benefit that, in case of tunnel
   aggregation, it is easier to find congruence among the segments of
   different constituent (service) tunnels and the resulting aggregation
   (base) tunnel in a region.  This leads to better bandwidth
   efficiency, because the more congruent they are, the fewer leaves of

Internet-Draft          evpn-bum-procedure-update              July 2015


   the base tunnel need to discard traffic when a service tunnel's
   segment does not need to receive the traffic (yet it is receiving the
   traffic due to aggregation).

   Another advantage of the smaller region is smaller BIER sub-domains.
   In this new multicast architecture BIER, packets carry a BitString,
   in which the bits correspond to edge routers that needs to receive
   traffic.  Smaller sub-domains means smaller BitStrings can be used
   without having to send multiple copies of the same packet.

   Finally, EVPN tunnel segmentation can be used for EVPN DCIs, as
   discussed in Section 9.  It follows the same concepts discussed
   above.

3.  Additional Route Types of EVPN NLRI

   RFC 7432 defines the format of EVPN NLRI as the following:

                    +-----------------------------------+
                    |    Route Type (1 octet)           |
                    +-----------------------------------+
                    |     Length (1 octet)              |
                    +-----------------------------------+
                    | Route Type specific (variable)    |
                    +-----------------------------------+

   So far five types have been defined:

         + 1 - Ethernet Auto-Discovery (A-D) route
         + 2 - MAC/IP Advertisement route
         + 3 - Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag route
         + 4 - Ethernet Segment route
         + 5 - IP Prefix Route

   This document defines three additional route types:

         + 6 - Per-Region I-PMSI A-D route
         + 7 - S-PMSI A-D route
         + 8 - Leaf A-D route

   The "Route Type specific" field of the type 6 and type 7 EVPN NLRIs
   starts with a type 1 RD, whose Administrative sub-field MUST match
   that of the RD in all the EVPN routes from the same advertising
   router for a given EVI, except the Leaf A-D route (Section 3.3).

3.1.  Per-Region I-PMSI A-D route

   The Per-region I-PMSI A-D route has the following format.  Its usage
   is discussed in Section 6.2.

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      RD   (8 octets)              |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)       |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      Source AS (4 octets)         |
                   +-----------------------------------+

   Other than the addition of Ethernet Tag ID, it is identical to the
   Type 2 MVPN route defined in Section 4.2 of RFC 6514.  the Source AS
   contains an Autonomous System Number (ASN).  Two-octet ASNs are
   encoded in the two low-order octets of the Source AS field, with the
   two high-order octets set to zero.

   For now this is only defined at AS level.  It may be defined for area
   or other levels in the future, if it becomes necessary.  To allow for
   that possibility, a "type" field and a "region-id" field may be used
   instead of a simple "Source AS".  This is pending community comments.

3.2.  S-PMSI A-D route

   The S-PMSI A-D route has the following format:

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      RD   (8 octets)              |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Ethernet Tag ID (4 octets)       |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   | Multicast Source Length (1 octet) |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Source (Variable)      |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Group Length (1 octet) |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |  Multicast Group   (Variable)     |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |   Originating Router's IP Addr    |
                   +-----------------------------------+

   Other than the addition of Ethernet Tag ID, it is identical to the
   S-PMSI A-D route as defined in RFC 7117.  The procedures in RFC 7117
   also apply (including wildcard functionality), except that the
   granularity level is per Ethernet Tag.

3.3.  Leaf-AD route

   The Route Type specific field of a Leaf A-D route consists of the
   following:

                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |      Route Key (variable)         |
                   +-----------------------------------+
                   |   Originating Router's IP Addr    |
                   +-----------------------------------+

   A Leaf A-D route is originated in response to a PMSI route, which
   could be an Inclusive Multicast Tag route, a per-region I-PMSI A-D
   route, an S-PMSI A-D route, or some other types of routes that may be
   defined in the future that triggers Leaf A-D routes.  The Route Key
   is the "Route Type Specific" field of the route for which this Leaf
   A-D route is generated.

   The general procedures of Leaf A-D route are first specified in RFC
   6514 for MVPN.  The principles apply to VPLS and EVPN as well.  RFC
   7117 has details for VPLS Multicast, and this document points out
   some specifics for EVPN, e.g. in Section 5.

4.  Selective Multicast

   RFC 7117 specifies Selective Multicast for VPLS.  Other than that
   different route types and formats are specified with EVPN SAFI for
   S-PMSI A-D and Leaf A-D routes (Section 3), all proceduers in RFC
   7117 with respect to Selective Multicast apply to EVPN as well,
   including wildcard procedures.

5.  Inter-AS Segmentation

5.1.  Changes to Section 7.2.2 of RFC 7117

   The first paragraph of Section 7.2.2.2 of RFC 7117 says:

     "... The best route procedures ensure that if multiple
     ASBRs, in an AS, receive the same Inter-AS A-D route from their EBGP
     neighbors, only one of these ASBRs propagates this route in Internal
     BGP (IBGP).  This ASBR becomes the root of the intra-AS segment of
     the inter-AS tree and ensures that this is the only ASBR that accepts
     traffic into this AS from the inter-AS tree."

   The above VPLS behavior requires complicated VPLS specific procedures
   for the ASBRs to reach agreement.  For EVPN, a different approach is
   be used and the above quoted text is not to be applied to EVPN.

Internet-Draft          evpn-bum-procedure-update              July 2015


   The Leaf A-D based procedure is used for each ASBR who re-advertises
   into the AS to discover the leaves on the segment rooted at itself.
   This is the same as the procedures for S-PMSI in RFC 7117 itself.

   The following text at the end of the second bullet:

         "................................................... If, in order
         to instantiate the segment, the ASBR needs to know the leaves of
         the tree, then the ASBR obtains this information from the A-D
         routes received from other PEs/ASBRs in the ASBR's own AS."

   is changed to the following:

         "................................................... If, in order
         to instantiate the segment, the ASBR needs to know the leaves of
         the tree, then the ASBR MUST set the LIR flag to 1 in the PTA to
         trigger Leaf A-D routes from egress PEs and downstream ASBRs.
         It MUST be (auto-)configured with an import RT, which controls
         acceptance of leaf A-D routes by the ASBR."

   Accordingly, the following paragraph in Section 7.2.2.4:

     "If the received Inter-AS A-D route carries the PMSI Tunnel attribute
     with the Tunnel Identifier set to RSVP-TE P2MP LSP, then the ASBR
     that originated the route MUST establish an RSVP-TE P2MP LSP with the
     local PE/ASBR as a leaf.  This LSP MAY have been established before
     the local PE/ASBR receives the route, or it MAY be established after
     the local PE receives the route."

   is changed to the following:

     "If the received Inter-AS A-D route has the LIR flag set in its PTA,
     then a receiving PE must originate a corresponding Leaf A-D route,
     and a receiving  ASBR must originate a corresponding Leaf A-D route
     if and only if it received and imported one or more corresponding Leaf
     A-D routes from its downstream IBGP or EBGP peers, or it has non-null
     downstream forwarding state on the PIM/mLDP tunnel that instantiates
     the intra-AS segment. The ASBR that (re-)advertised of the Inter-AS A-D
     route then establishes a tunnel to the leaves discovered by the Leaf A-D
     routes."

5.2.  I-PMSI Leaf Tracking

   An ingress PE does not set the LIR flag in its I-PMSI's PTA, even
   with Ingress Replication or RSVP-TE P2MP tunnels.  It does not rely
   on the Leaf A-D routes to discover leaves in its AS, and Section 11.2
   of RFC 7432 explicitly states that the LIR flag must be set to zero.




Zhang, et al.            Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft          evpn-bum-procedure-update              July 2015


   An implementation of RFC 7432 might have used the Originating
   Router's IP Address field of the Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag
   routes to determine the leaves, or might have used the Next Hop field
   instead.  W/o segmentation, both will lead to the same result.

   With segmentation, an ingress PE MUST determine the leaves in its AS
   from the BGP next hops in all its received I-PMSI A-D routes, so it
   does not have to set the LIR bit set to request Leaf A-D routes.  PEs
   within the same AS will all have different next hops in their I-PMSI
   A-D routes (hence will all be considered as leaves), and PEs from
   other ASes will have the next hop in their I-PMSI A-D routes set to
   addresses of ASBRs in this local AS, hence only those ASBRs will be
   considered as leaves (as proxies for those PEs in other ASes).  Note
   that in case of Ingress Replication, when an ASBR re-advertises IBGP
   I-PMSI A-D routes, it MUST advertise the same label for all those for
   the same Ethernet Tag ID and the same EVI.  When an ingress PE builds
   its flooding list, multiple routes may have the same (nexthop, label)
   tuple and they will only be added as a single branch in the flooding
   list.

5.3.  Backward Compatibility

   The above procedures assume that all PEs are upgraded to support the
   segmentation procedures:

   o  An ingress PE uses the Next Hop instead of Originating Router's IP
      Address to determine leaves for the I-PMSI tunnel.

   o  An egress PE in a different AS sends Leaf A-D routes in response
      to I-PMSI routes, whose PTA has the LIR flag set by the re-
      advertising ASBRs.

   If a deployment has legacy PEs that does not support the above, then
   a legacy ingress PE would include all PEs (including those in remote
   ASes) as leaves of the inclusive tunnel and try to send traffic to
   them directly (no segmentation), which is either undesired or not
   possible; a legacy egress PE would not send Leaf A-D routes so the
   ASBRs would not know to send external traffic to them.

   To address this backward compatibility problem, the following
   procedure can be used (see Section 6.2 for per-PE/AS/region I-PMSI
   A-D routes):

   o  An upgraded PE includes some indication in its per-PE I-PMSI A-D
      route that it supports the new procedures.

   o  All per-PE I-PMSI A-D routes are restricted to the local AS and
      not propagated to external peers.

   o  The ASBRs in an AS originate per-region I-PMSI A-D routes and
      advertise to their external peers to advertise tunnels used to
      carry traffic from the local AS to other ASes.  Depending on the
      types of tunnels being used, the LIR flag in the PTA may be set,
      in which case the downstream ASBRs and upgraded PEs will send Leaf
      A-D routes to pull traffic from their upstream ASBRs.  One of the
      ASBRs in a downstream AS will be elected, based on the per-region
      I-PMSI A-D routes, to send traffic from the per-region I-PMSI
      tunnel to legacy PEs in the AS.

   o  In an ingress AS, if and only if an ASBR has active downstream
      receivers (PEs and ASBRs), which are learned either explicitly via
      Leaf AD routes or implicitly via PIM join or mLDP label mapping,
      the ASBR originates a per-PE I-PMSI A-D route (i.e., regular
      Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag route) into the local AS, and
      stitches incoming per-PE I-PMSI tunnels into its per-region I-PMSI
      tunnel.  With this, it gets traffic from local PEs and send to
      other ASes via the tunnel announced in its per-region I-PMSI A-D
      route.

6.  Inter-Region Segmentation

6.1.  Area vs. Region

   RFC 7524 is for MVPN/VPLS inter-area segmentation and does not
   explicitly cover EVPN.  However, if "area" is replaced by "region"
   and "ABR" is replaced by "RBR" (Regional Border Router) then
   everything still works, and can be applied to EVPN as well.

   A region can be a sub-area, or can be an entire AS including its
   external links.  Instead of automatic region definition based on IGP
   areas, a region would be defined as a BGP peer group.  In fact, even
   with IGP area based region definition, a BGP peer group listing the
   PEs and ABRs in an area is still needed.

   Consider the following example diagram:

             ---------           ------             ---------
            /         \         /      \           /         \

   The inter-as segmentation procedures specified so far (RFC 6513/6514,
   7117, and Section 5 of this document) requires all ASBRs to be
   involved, and Ingress Replication is used between two ASBRs in
   different ASes.

   In the above diagram, it's possible that ASBR1/4 does not support
   segmentation, and the provider tunnels in AS 100/300 can actually
   extend across the external link.  In the case, the inter-region
   segmentation procedures can be used instead - a region is the entire
   (AS100 + ASBR1-ASBR2 link) or (AS300 + ASBR3-ASBR4 link).  ASBR2/3
   would be the RBRs, and ASBR1/4 will just be a transit core router
   with respect to provider tunnels.

   As illustrated in the diagram below, ASBR2/3 will establish a
   multihop EBGP session with either a RR or directly with PEs in the
   neighboring AS.  I/S-PMSI A-D routes from ingress PEs will not be
   processed by ASBR1/4.  When ASBR2 re-advertises the routes into AS
   200, it changes the next hop to its own address and changes PTA to
   specify the tunnel type/identification in its own AS.  When ASBR3 re-
   advertises I/S-PMSI A-D routes into the neighboring AS 300, it
   changes the next hop to its own address and changes PTA to specify
   the tunnel type/identification in the neighboring region 3.  Now the
   segment is rooted at ASBR3 and extends across the external link to
   PEs.

6.2.  Per-region Aggregation

   Notice that every I/S-PMSI route from each PE will be propagated
   throughout all the ASes or regions.  They may also trigger
   corresponding Leaf A-D routes depending on the types of tunnels used
   in each region.  This may become too many - routes and corresponding
   tunnels.  To address this concern, the I-PMSI routes from all PEs in
   a AS/region can be aggregated into a single I-PMSI route originated
   from the RBRs, and traffic from all those individual I-PMSI tunnels
   will be switched into the single I-PMSI tunnel.  This is like the
   MVPN Inter-AS I-PMSI route originated by ASBRs.




Zhang, et al.            Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft          evpn-bum-procedure-update              July 2015


   The MVPN Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D route can be better called as per-AS
   I-PMSI A-D route, to be compared against the (per-PE) Intra-AS I-PMSI
   A-D routes originated by each PE.  In this document we will call it
   as per-region I-PMSI A-D route, in case we want to apply the
   aggregation at regional level.  The per-PE I-PMSI routes will not be
   propagated to other regions.  If multiple RBRs are connected to a
   region, then each will advertise such a route, with the same route
   key (Section 3.1).  Similar to the per-PE I-PMSI A-D routes, RBRs/PEs
   in a downstream region will each select a best one from all those re-
   advertised by the upstream RBRs, hence will only receive traffic
   injected by one of them.

   MVPN does not aggregate S-PMSI routes from all PEs in an AS like it
   does for I-PMSIs routes, because the number of PEs that will
   advertise S-PMSI routes for the same (s,g) or (*,g) is small.  This
   is also the case for EVPN, i.e., there is no per-region S-PMSI
   routes.

   Notice that per-region I-PMSI routes can also be used to address
   backwards compatibility issue, as discussed in Section 5.3.

6.3.  Use of S-NH-EC

   RFC 7524 specifies the use of S-NH-EC because it does not allow ABRs
   to change the BGP next hop when they re-advertise I/S-PMSI AD routes
   to downstream areas.  That is only to be consistent with the MVPN
   Inter-AS I-PMSI A-D routes, whose next hop must not be changed when
   they're re-advertised by the segmenting ABRs for reasons specific to
   MVPN.  For EVPN, it is perfectly fine to change the next hop when
   RBRs re-advertise the I/S-PMSI A-D routes, instead of relying on S-
   NH-EC.  As a result, this document specifies that RBRs change the BGP
   next hop when they re-advertise I/S-PMSI A-D routes and do not use S-
   NH-EC. if a downstream PE/RBR needs to originate Leaf A-D routes, it
   simply uses the BGP next hop in the corresponding I/S-PMSI A-D routes
   to construct Route Targets.

   The advantage of this is that neither ingress nor egress PEs need to
   understand/use S-NH-EC, and consistent procedure (based on BGP next
   hop) is used for both inter-as and inter-region segmentation.

6.4.  Ingress PE's I-PMSI Leaf Tracking

   RFC 7524 specifies that when an ingress PE/ASBR (re-)advertises an
   VPLS I-PMSI A-D route, it sets the LIR flag to 1 in the route's PTA.
   Similar to the inter-as case, this is actually not really needed for
   EVPN.  To be consistent with the inter-as case, the ingress PE does
   not set the LIR flag in its originated I-PMSI A-D routes, and




Zhang, et al.            Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          evpn-bum-procedure-update              July 2015


   determines the leaves based on the BGP next hops in its received
   I-PMSI A-D routes, as specified in Section 5.2.

   The same backward compatibility issue exists, and the same solution
   as in the inter-as case applies.

7.  Intra-region Segmentation and Assisted Ingress Replication

   [draft-rabadan-bess-evpn-optimized-ir] describes "Assisted Ingress
   Replication", which reduces the burden of NVEs by having them
   replicate to only one of a few designated replicators, which will
   then replicate to other relevant NVEs.  The tunnel segmentation
   procedures can be extended to achieve the same, even with the support
   for MPLS encapsulation.

   With inter-region segmentation, an RBR, which is a Route Reflector,
   changes the BGP Next Hop to one of its own addresses when it re-
   advertises an I/S-PMSI route to other regions, and sets the LIR bit
   in the PTA Flag field when necessary, but it does not do so when re-
   advertising to NVEs in its own region.  If it does that even when re-
   advertising to local NVEs, then it becomes a replicator as in [draft-
   rabadan-bess-evpn-optimized-ir]: NVEs will respond with Leaf AD
   routes to individual I-PMSI routes from NVEs, but targeted to the re-
   advertising RBR of the selected best one (out of all those same
   routes re-advertised by different RBRs).  so that the sending NVEs
   will only replicate to the RBRs, which will in turn replicate to
   NVEs.

   A RNVE (Regular, or legacy NVE) is not able to send back Leaf A-D
   routes so one of the RBRs MUST be designated to relay packets from
   NVEs to RNVEs.  RNVEs will replicate traffic directly to all NVEs/
   RNVEs.  In case of MPLS encapsulation, NVEs advertise a label in
   their I-PMSI A-D routes even if they track the leaves via Leaf A-D
   routes by setting the LIR bit, and RBRs MUST not change that when re-
   advertise the routes (from NVEs or RNVEs).  RNVEs can be identified
   by the lack of indication as discussed in Section 5.3 in their I-PMSI
   A-D routes.

   To address the possible concern with too many Leaf A-D routes (every
   NVE will respond with one to its selected RBR for each I-PMSI A-D
   route), a RBR can turn off or not set the LIR bit when it re-
   advertises the I-PMSI routes so that no Leaf A-D routes will be
   triggered from NVEs.  It also originates a per-region I-PMSI A-D
   route (Section 6.2), but instead of into other regions, it is back
   into the same region.  The route has the LIR bit set so that NVEs
   will respond with a Leaf A-D route.  The per-region I-PMSI A-D routes
   from the RBRs and corresponding Leaf A-D routes from NVEs are
   comparable to the Replicator-AR and Leaf-AR routes with the Optimized



Zhang, et al.            Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 13]

   IR method (Selective Mode).  This allows a RBR to determine the set
   of NVEs that it is responsible for relaying incoming traffic to.  In
   case of MPLS encapsulation, for split-horizon purpose, NVEs
   supporting this functionality MUST set the LIR bit in their I-PMSI
   A-D routes to trigger corresponding Leaf A-D routes from RBRs, with
   different labels advertised in the Leaf A-D routes for different
   NVEs, so that RBRs know the source NVEs of incoming packets, and will
   not relay the traffic back to the source NVE.

   If the RBRs do not set the LIR bit in the re-advertised I-PMSI A-D
   routes, nor do they advertise per-region I-PMSI A-D routes, then this
   corresponds to the Non-Selective mode of Optimized IR mothod - A RBR
   MUST be chosen to replicate to all NVEs and RNVEs.  An NVE could
   specify its own chosen RBR by including an IP Address based EC in its
   I-PMSI A-D route, and only send to specified RBR.  In case of MPLS
   encapsulation, again for split-horizon purposes the NVEs MUST set the
   LIR bit so that the RBRs will advertise different labels for
   different NVEs and therefore set up its forwarding state to not relay
   a packet back to the sending NVE.

7.1.  Mix of inter-region and intra-region segmentation

   Some more details may need to be spelled out when intra-region
   segmentation is used for IR optimization while in the mean time
   inter-region segmentation is used, with RNVEs present in different
   regions.

8.  Multi-homing Support

   If multi-homing does not span across different ASes or regions,
   existing procedures work with segmenation.  If an ES is multi-homed
   to PEs in different ASes or regions, additional procedures are needed
   to work with segmentation.  The procedures are well understood but
   omitted here until the requirement becomes clear.

9.  EVPN DCI

   In addition to inter-as/region segmentation uses cases, EVPN Overlay
   DC Interconnect is another important use case for EVPN tunnel
   segmentation.

   Section 5.1.1.1 and 5.1.1.2 of [draft-ietf-bess-evpn-overlay] discuss
   two options of interconnecting EVPN Overlay DCs.  With the GW option,
   DC EVPNs and Interconnect EVPN (DCI) are independent and terminate at
   the GWs.  With the non-GW option, DC EVPNs and Interconnect EVPN form
   an integral EVPN, just like EVPN inter-as option-B.  The GW option is
   discussed in details in section 3.4 of [draft-ietf-bess-dci-evpn-
   overlay].



Zhang, et al.            Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          evpn-bum-procedure-update              July 2015


   The non-GW option can only be used when PEs can use VNI/VSID that has
   local significance (like mpls labels), and the GW option must be used
   otherwise.  With the GW option, mac lookup must be performed when
   traffic comes from where non-local VNI/VSID are used.  Otherwise,
   label/VNI/VSID switching can be used (typical inter-as option-B
   behavior).

   Note that with either option, BUM traffic forwarding can be based on
   tunnel stitching instead of mac lookup (except if IR is used together
   with non-local VNI/VSID), because BUM traffic goes to all PEs on
   corresponding provider tunnels instead of to targeted PEs.  The
   following sections discusses some specific details for each option.

9.1.  Non-GW Option

   The non-GW option can be easily compared to EVPN/mpls inter-region
   scenario where a region spans an entire AS - assuming that each DC is
   in its own AS that is different from the DCI's and other DCs'..

   Consider the following diagram:

   The RBRs are WAN Edge routers.  They re-advertise I/S-PMSI routes
   from one side to the other, following the previous described
   segmentation procedures.  For example, the Inclusive Multicast Route
   from NVE1 is re-advertised into the WAN side by both RBR 1 and RBR2,
   with the LIR flag bit set in the PTA, and then re-advertised into DC2
   by RBR3/4.  NVE3/4 could both choose either the one re-advertised by
   RBR3 or by RBR4, or could each choose a different one (e.g., NVE3

   chooses the one re-advertised by RBR3 while NVE4 chooses the one re-
   advertised by RBR4).  Each either joins the advertised PIM tunnel or
   send a corresponding Leaf A-D route to the re-advertiser of the
   chosen best route.  RBR3 and/or RBR4 repeat the process, followed by
   RBR1 and/or RBR2 doing the same.  At the end, a segmented tunnel is
   established to reach all NVE3/4.  When BUM traffic arrives on RBR1/2
   from NVE1 via the tunnel segment in DC1, the multicast VXLAN
   encapsulation is removed and the traffic is directly switched into
   the segment in the WAN w/o going through mac lookup.

   The per-region aggregation method (Section 6.2) can be used to limit
   the I-PMSI A-D routes to each DC.

9.2.  GW option

   The GWs consumes EVPN routes from the DC side and re-originate new
   ones into the WAN side, and vice versa.  All GWs will advertise their
   own I-PMSI A-D route to the DC and WAN side, but only the DF on an
   internal ESI (I-ESI) for the local DC will forward BUM traffic from
   one EVPN domain to the other.  For example, BUM traffic from NVE1
   will reach both GW1 and GW2, but only the DF, say GW1, will forward
   to the WAN side.  The traffic will then reach both GW3 and GW4, but
   again only the DF (for the I-ESI for DC2, say GW4) will forward
   traffic into DC2.

   In [draft-ietf-bess-dci-evpn-overlay], the traffic forwarding by GWs
   is based on mac lookup - because of global significance of VNIs in



Zhang, et al.            Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 16]

Internet-Draft          evpn-bum-procedure-update              July 2015


   DCs, the VXLAN encapsulation cannot indicate to which remote NVE a
   known unicast packet should be forwarded to.  However for BUM
   traffic, this is not a problem - a BUM packet only need to be put
   onto the appropriate tunnel.  As a result, the DF GW on the I-ESI for
   a local DC can stitch all incoming BUM tunnels from local NVEs to its
   tunnel on the WAN side, and stitch all incoming BUM tunnels from
   remote GWs in the DCI into its tunnel on the DC side.  This way, BUM
   traffic will be switched via label/VNI/VSID or multicast vxlan tunnel
   destination, bypassing mac lookup.  Note that, this works only if
   Ingress Replication is not used for BUM traffic in an EVPN Overlay
   DC, because in that case the only way to distinguish BUM traffic from
   known uncast traffic is by checking mac address of the packets.

   Because the I-PMSI routes/tunnels are terminated in each DC/DCI, the
   I-PMSI routes originated by GWs are somewhat similar to the per-
   region I-PMSI routes discussed in the previous section.  However, the
   per-region I-PMSI routes from RBRs in the same DC have the same route
   key and NVEs will only receive traffic from one of the RBRs based on
   best route selection, while the per-GW I-PMSI routes are distinct and
   all NVEs receive traffic from the same one of the GWs because only
