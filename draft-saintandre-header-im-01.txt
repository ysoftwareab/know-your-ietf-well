Abstract

   This document defines a header field that enables the author of an
   email or netnews message to include an Instant Messaging (IM) URI in
   the message header block for the purpose of associating the author
   with an instant messaging address.

Internet-Draft                    IM-ID                    November 2007


1.  Introduction

   Several technologies enable entities to exchange messages in close to
   real time, also known as "instant messaging" or IM [IMP-REQS].  Such
   technologies include the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
   [XMPP-IM] and the Session Initiation Protocol [SIP-IM].  To
   facilitate the exchange of instant messages, a URI scheme for IM is
   defined in [CPIM].

   Because almost all human users of instant messaging systems also use
   email systems and because many such users also use netnews systems,
   it can be helpful for such users to specify their IM URIs in the
   messages they author.  The IM-ID header field provides a standard
   location for such information.  This document documents the syntax
   and implementation of the IM-ID header field, including the
   information necessary to register it in the Permanent Message Header
   Field Registry maintained by the IANA.


2.  Syntax

   The syntax of the IM-ID header field is defined below using Augmented
   Backus-Naur Form (as specified by [ABNF]), where the "IM-URI" rule is
   defined in [CPIM] and the remaining rules are defined in [MESSAGE]:

   "IM-ID:" SP *WSP pathxmpp *WSP CRLF


3.  Implementation

3.1.  Inclusion

   The IM-ID header field is associated with the author of the message;
   see [MESSAGE].  If the "From:" header field contains more than one
   mailbox, the IM-ID header field should not be added to the message.
   There should be no more than one instance of the IM-ID header field.

3.2.  Generation

   For a user whose instant messaging URI is "im:juliet@example.com",
   the corresponding IM-ID header field would be:

   IM-ID: im:juliet@example.com

3.3.  Processing

   Upon receiving a message containing an IM-ID header field, a user
   agent that supports the field should process the field by resolving
   the instant messaging URI in accordance with the procedures specified
   in [CPIM].

3.4.  Disposition

   A user agent that has processed an IM-ID header field may provide
   appropriate interface elements if it has independent information
   linking the author of the message with the specified instant
   messaging URI (e.g., via a user-controlled address book or automated
   directory lookup).  Such interface elements might include an element
   that enables the user to initiate a text chat with the author.


4.  IANA Considerations

   In accordance with [REG], the IANA registers the "IM-ID" header field
   in the Permanent Message Header Field Registry.  The registration
   template is as follows:

   Header field name:  IM-ID
   Applicable protocol:  mail, netnews
   Status:  permanent
   Author/Change controller:  Peter Saint-Andre
      <mailto:stpeter@jabber.org>
   Specification document(s):  draft-saintandre-header-im-00 [Note to
      IANA and RFC Editor: Replace I-D name with RFC XXXX, where "XXXX"
      is the number of the RFC that results from this specification, if
      any]
   Related information:  For detail information regarding instant
      messaging URIs, refer to RFC 3860.


5.  Security Considerations

   Message headers are an existing standard and are designed to easily
   accommodate new types.  Although the IM-ID header field may be
   forged, this problem is inherent in Internet email; however, because
   a forged IM-ID header field may break automated processing,
   applications should not depend on the IM-ID header field to indicate
   the authenticity of an email message or the identity of its author or
   sender.  Including the IM-ID header field among the signer header
   fields in DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) can help to mitigate
   against forging of the header (see [DKIMSIG]).

   Advertising instant messaging URIs in message headers may make it
   easier for malicious users to harvest such URIs and therefore to send
   unsolicited bulk communications to the users or applications
   represented by those URIs.  Care should be taken in balancing the
   benefits of open information exchange against the potential costs of
   unwanted communication.  An user agent that is capable of including
   the IM-ID header field in outgoing messages should provide an option
   for its user to disable inclusion of the IM-ID header field
   generally, on a per-recipient basis, and on a per-message basis.

   The security considerations discussed in [URI] and [CPIM] may also
   apply to the IM-ID message header.
