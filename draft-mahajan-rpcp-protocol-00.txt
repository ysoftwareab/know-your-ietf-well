ABSTRACT

RPCP is a generic interface protocol between two entities, where 
one entity acting as Resource Pool (RP) and other being the 
Resource Pool Controller (RPC). The RP entity in turn may be 
acting as RPC for other RPs in a hierarchical manner. The resource
being defined can be any hardware/software, physical/virtual 
resource.

In today's telecommunication world, the intelligence is being 
moved away from the hardware (the embedded platform) or the 
switching fabric to a more generic computing resource (high-end 
servers). These computing resources controls the call logic, 
service logic and the network signalling part. This implies that 
there is a need for an open interface protocol by which call 
agents or signalling agents can control this rather dumb hardware

as resource pools. This helps in easy and smooth integration of 
these entities even if they come from different vendors. 

The Interworking and Gateway market is a very big market today. 
The network architecture proposed for these solutions carries the 
intelligence away from the resource pools (also called media 
gateways) to call agents or pool controllers (also called media 
gateway controllers). With such network architectures the need
for such a protocol is more prominent.

There are many other needs and use of such a protocol which will 
be discussed in detail in this white paper. This paper does not 
try to define the complete protocol, however the basic definition 
and the protocol architecture will be defined.                                         

The document first describes the application of Resource Pool 
Control protocol, followed by requirements from this Protocol and 
then defines the Protocol Architecture with basic protocol 
definition. The annexure of the document gives few examples on 
RPCP usage.


1.0 APPLICATION OF RESOURCE CONTROL PROTOCOL

There are many applications for a resource control protocol, but 
all of them will not be discussed over here. However a few of the 
representative needs are detailed below.

1.1 Signalling and Call Agents separation from switching fabric

As new switching architecture or network components are moving 
intelligence away from the hardware (embedded platforms) to more 
generic computing resources (high-end computers). Different 
vendors can produce these two components, with an open interface 
defined between them. The call agents/signalling agents  controls 
the hardware resource pools through such a control protocol or 
interface. Each vendor is defining its own interface to control 
the hardware resources or to communicate signalling information, 
from the controlling entity (call agents/signalling agents) to 
resource pool. It will require efforts on the controlling entity 
part to comply with number of such interfaces. However if an open 
and flexible protocol definition exists and being used by both the
sides, the integration of switching fabric and call intelligence 
will be an easy task.

1.2 Gateway Architecture

Most of the gateways today have a distributed architecture with 
intelligence moved away from the resources required for the 
application/service, to the call-agents/signalling-agents and an 



Mahajan                                                [Page 2]

interface protocol being defined between these two entities by the
vendor himself. One of the examples for such architecture is voice
over packet network gateways. These gateway supports SCN interface
on one side and packet network interface on the other side. The 
architecture suggested for such gateways requires the resource 
pool (voice processing, voice packetization, echo cancellation 
etc) being concentrated on one entity called the media gateway and
the intelligence for call handling and resource control being 
located on other entity called media gateway controller.  The 
media gateway controller can control multiple of such media 
gateways depending on the processing and interface capacity of the
controller. However to the external world i.e. the PSTN network 
and the packet network the gateway appears as a single entity 
providing the interworking/gateway functions. Therefore for such 
architecture there is a need for an interface protocol by which 
media gateway controller can control multiple media gateways. As 
of today there exists few such protocol which defines the interface
for such communication. The major drawback of these protocols is a
bias towards the voice over packet gateways and the protocol is not
generic to cater to all the gateway/interworking function 
requirements.

1.3 Resource Sharing

Toady's telecom network architecture is moving towards resource 
sharing concept, instead of each application/service to own the 
resources required. One of the example is the Intelligent 
Peripheral (IP) component in AIN (Advanced Intelligent Networks).
IP provides the voice resources required for any call-related 
application, to any of the SSP/SCP (Service and Switching Point/
Service Control Point) in the network. This can access these 
components. The logic for moving such a resource to a separate 
component in network to allow sharing of resources and easy 
definition of service logic. Similar to this there are many other 
services which requires sharing of resources like, Interactive 
Voice Response (IVR) applications, call centres, conference bridges
etc. If the service logic resides somewhere else and the service 
resources concentrated on a separate entity, it requires an 
interface protocol for communication or for resource control.

1.4 Rapid Introduction of new Services

In case of traditional telecommunication network, any new service
development requires changes throughout the network for the service
logic to be supported at each and every node in the network, since
the service logic is embedded into each and every node. The current
AIN network architecture moves the service logic away from service
node and is being controlled by a few service controls points in 
the network. As the demand for new service in the market is high,
the same reasoning applies to other network domains as well, which



Mahajan                                                [Page 3]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Resource Pool Control Protocol       August 1999



requires the service logic to be easily adaptable/introduced in the
network by changing the logic (or putting a new service) at a few 
nodes in the network. Therefore for a fast and easy service 
introduction in the market the service development may require 
parallel development by many. This requires the interface to be 
defined every time a new service is developed. If no standard 
interface exists, a new local interface is used every time a new 
service is defined.

1.5 Hierarchical Networks

Most of the toady's telecommunication networks have hierarchical 
network configuration. This sometime requires different protocols 
at different levels. The need for different protocol for network 
management, signalling control, node management or even for service
management, if the network node has a different perspective view 
of the nodes below it in the hierarchy or for the nodes it is 
controlling. However, if each node in the network views the other 
node that it is controlling or managing, as resource pool and the 
interface between them is the resource control protocol, the 
interface at all levels is uniform. This definition can be extended
even to lower levels of communication, like signalling protocol 
layers talking to hardware which is implemented as RP and protocol
control entity as RPC. Another example can be the voice application
(media control applications) controlling the media control provided
by hardware or firmware, if media acts as RP and control 
application as RPC. If this protocol provide uniform interface at 
all levels, then each entity in the network needs to define the 
resources it hold and the capability of each such resource. The 
resource control entity needs to use this interface to control 
these resources to provide the desired service in the network. 


2.0 REQUIREMENTS FROM RESOURCE CONTROL PROTOCOL

The requirements from Resource Control Protocol are listed below

- Interface protocol definition to be simple and generic.

- Definition needs to be standardised.

- Definition of protocol to be defined as binary protocol not text
  based (Being an application level protocol it may use ASN 
  definition for protocol constructs).

- Protocol needs to support resource advertising.

- Protocol to support resource capabilities advertising.

- Protocol to support controller redundancy.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Resource Pool Control Protocol       August 1999



- Protocol to support service/logic/script execution by resource 
  pool, the service/script logic to be derived from resource 
  capability.

- Protocol to support failure management of resources and entities.

- Protocol definition can be extended to support management 
  (configuration/ statistics/alarms) interface. 

- Protocol to support any resource control, where the resource can
  be a hardware resource, software resource or even the algorithms.
  Examples of resources are bearer trunks in network, SS7 node 
  advertising SS7 signalling as resource and capability as enable/
  disable signalling.

- Protocol definition to support the hierarchical resource 
  configuration, which means that the resource pool may in turn be
  controlling other resources by same protocol and the same 
  definition is applicable at all the interfaces.

- Protocol definition should be extendable to support any generic 
  protocol embedded in it.

- Protocol to be superset of any popular gateway control protocol 
  like MGCP, i.e. any capability/function supported by MGCP to be 
  there in this protocol as well.

- Initial definition of protocol to provide support for 
  international network signalling protocols like SS7 etc. and 
  later definitions may provide support for other protocols. 
  However the definition of protocol to be generic to support any 
  interface, but first definition to give representative cases/
  examples for such protocols or network configurations.


3.0 DEFINITIONS

- Resource
Resource, is the entity in the resource pool which along with the
resource capabilities can be used by Resource Pool Controller 
either independently or in combination with other resource entities
to execute a service. Resource can be any hardware, software, 
physical or virtual resource. Example of hardware resources are 
bearer trunks, interface cards etc. Examples of software resources
are signalling software, voice processing software etc. Examples 
of physical resources are hardware resources, circuits, subscriber
lines etc. Examples of virtual resources are the resources 
controlled by any Resource Pool Controller but being advertised by
it as holding them as resources.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Resource Pool Control Protocol       August 1999



- Resource Pool
RP, is the logical collection of resources of similar kind or 
different kinds with the capability to interface with RPC, 
advertise and execute the resource capabilities on command from 
RPC. 

 - Resource Capability
RC, is the detection, generation or execution capability of the 
resources defined above. Examples of RC are detection of line 
signals on line interface, tone generation or detection capability.
Resource capability is always specified along with the resource 
identification.

- Resource Capability Category
Capability category determines whether the capability is of 
detection, generation, and execution or combination type.

 - RPC
Resource Pool Controller, is the entity, which controls the 
resource pool entity through interface protocol RPCP. However the 
service logic or the control logic is supported by the RPC.

- RPCP
Resource Pool Control Protocol, is a generic interface protocol 
between two entities, where one entity acting as Resource Pool (RP)
and other being the Resource Pool Controller (RPC), however the RP
entity may in turn be acting as RPC for other RPs in a hierarchical
manner.

- Control Interface
Control interface is the interface between RP and RPC.

4.0 PROTOCOL ARCHITECTURE

This section describes the protocol architecture and few of the 
constructs needed to define protocol. Each of these constructs 
will have definition of the protocol elements required for it. 
However this paper does not try to define the complete protocol.

4.1 Network Architecture

This protocol is an interface protocol between RP and RPC. The 
connection at the logical level or protocol interaction level is 
assumed to be of tree type as shown in following picture.

One RPC can be connected to many RPs whereas each RP can get 
connected to only one RPC. This definition however is applicable 
at logical level or the protocol interaction level. Single physical
entity may host more than one RP, whereas each RP may be 
interfacing with different RPC for resource control. Each of this 
RPs may then be treated as separate RPs at logical level.

5.0 RPCP PROTOCOL DEFINITION

RPCP protocol is an application level protocol. The protocol 
definition today does not define the lower layers required for the
transport of protocol element/constructs between RP and RPC. 
However the lower layer support or the communication channel type 
required are listed below.

- Non Real-Time Reliable Communication Channel. 

Examples are TCP connections on ethernet, SCCP connections in SS7 
networks etc. This channel is needed for protocol construct, which
do not have reliability defined with protocol. However unreliable 
channel can be used instead with reliability being handled by 
protocol.

- Non Real-Time Unreliable Communication Channel.

Examples are UDP connection on ethernet, high- speed, local bus 
communication etc. This channel is used for protocol constructs 
which have reliability defined with protocol. However reliable 
channel can be used instead if one available.

- Real-Time Unreliable Communication Channel.

Examples are RTP, RTCP channels as defined by IETF RFCs, high 
speed local bus communication, circuit switched communication etc.
This channel is mostly used for bearer data communication, which 
requires some real time data transfer.

Each of the protocol constructs defined in later sections will 
specify along with the definition, the type of lower layer channel
required.

5.1 Basic Protocol Definition
RPCP protocol supports three basic categories of protocol 
constructs

- Service Execution constructs

- Node/Protocol Management constructs

- Transparent mode support

Service execution related constructs support resource and 
capability advertising by RP to RPC and service execution logic 
construct by RPC to RP. The results or updates are sent in either
direction. Initially each RP when it comes up, after local 
initialisation it advertises its resource and resource capability 
to RPC (if required). Once the resources and its capabilities are 
known to RPC, it can send service or control logic to RP for 
service execution. The events, results or errors of service 
execution are returned by RP to RPC. Any execution update or 
premature termination of execution is sent from RPC to RP.

- Service Logic Database

7.0 PROTOCOL CONSTRUCTS/ELEMENTS

This section defines protocol constructs related to service 
execution with brief description along with the basic elements for
each construct, direction of information flow and type of lower 
layer support. 

1. Res_Cap_Update_req
   Direction: RP to RPC
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time unreliable channel.
   Elements: Update_id, Data_size,  Duplicate_id
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RP, when it comes up or at 
   any configuration change, to send a request to RPC for resource
   and capability advertising. The update_id is the resource and 
   capability database id. It is used by RPC to check if no updates
   are required. Data size is used to give RPC an estimate of total
   volume of resource and capability database size.  Duplicate_id 
   is used, if RP is exact duplicate of some other RP in terms of 
   resource and capability database (this is managed by local 
   management entity). This construct is repeated, if no 
   acknowledgement is received after the configurable protocol 
   timer expires.

2. Res_Cap_Update_ack
   Direction: RPC to RP
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time unreliable channel.
   Elements: Update_mode, Delay
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RPC to respond to RP's 
   request for update. The Update mode returned by RPC tells RP 
   whether to send the update, delay sending update or there is no
   need for the update. RPC based on the duplicate_id, data_size 
   and the update_id decides whether to take the update now, delay
   it or no need for update (as it has the most recent update). The
   delay parameter is used when RPC tells RP to reattempt the 
   request and specify the delay amount, in seconds.

INTERNET-DRAFT    Resource Pool Control Protocol       August 1999



3. Res_Advertize
   Direction: RP to RPC
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time Reliable channel.
   Elements: Resource_id Structure
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RP to update RPC with the 
   resources available at RP in case the RPC update is not the 
   recent one. The Resource id structure describes each resource 
   with its id. This construct is used to advertise only those 
   resources, which needs to be controlled by RPC.

4. Cap_Advertize
   Direction: RP to RPC
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time Reliable channel.
   Elements: Capability_id Structure
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RP to update RPC with the 
   resources capabilities available at RP in case the RPC update is
   not the recent one. The Capability id structure describes each 
   resource capability along with the capability category.

5. End_Advertize
   Direction: RP to RPC
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time Reliable channel.
   Elements: Record count
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RP to tell RPC the end of 
   advertising, and sends a record count parameter. Record count 
   parameter is used by RPC to compare the records received with 
   that sent by RP.

6. Execute_Logic
   Direction: RPC to RP
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time Unreliable channel.
   Elements: Update, logic_id, Update_frequency, Execution logic
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RPC to either update the RPs
   logic database or to request RP to execute the service logic. If
   update flag is set to update and execute, RP updates the 
   database with execution logic and then executes it. However if 
   it says either executes or Update, the service logic is executed
   and not updated in database or Updated and not executed. The 
   execution logic defines the service logic including the 
   resources and using simple constructs based on the resource 
   capability and its category. Where category as defined before 
   can be detection, execution, generation or combination of these.
   The service logic constructs include simple constructs like if,
   then, else or loops like while, for etc. Update Frequency is 
   used by RPC to tell RP the frequency with which to update the 
   status of execution. It can be in terms of time or execution 



Mahajan                                                [Page 13]

INTERNET-DRAFT    Resource Pool Control Protocol       August 1999



   steps etc. Example use of update_frequency are to report 
   statistics periodically, report alarms or update the status of 
   execution logic to RPC after each execution step.

7. Logic_Update
   Direction: RPC to RP
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time Unreliable channel.
   Elements: logic_id, Update_type, Execution_logic, 
	     Update_frequency
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RPC to either update the RP's
   current execution or terminate it. The termination can be either
   graceful or abrupt, which will be defined by this parameter. If
   logic is updated, RP either starts re-executing the logic as 
   specified by Execution_logic parameter or adds to the current 
   executing logic.

8. Result_Report
   Direction: RP to RPC
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time reliable channel.
   Elements: Logic_id, Result Structure
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RP to update the status of 
   execution to RPC, as specified in Execute_logic by 
   Update_frequency.

9. Event_Report
   Direction: RP to RPC
   Channel Required: Non Real-Time reliable channel.
   Elements:  logic_id, Event Structure
   Description: 
   This protocol construct is used by RP to update the events, as 
   reported by detection resources, to RPC.

10. Error_Report
    Direction: RP to RPC
    Channel Required: Non Real-Time reliable channel.
    Elements: logic_id, Error Structure
    Description: 
    This protocol construct is used by RP to report any error 
    during execution of service logic for logic_id .


8.0 CONCLUSION

RPCP can provide a uniform interface protocol between different 
network entities(signalling controllers, call agents, network 
management centres etc.) if each of such entity defines the 
resources and capabilities and identifies the resource controllers.
Differnet vendors can produce Resource pools and Pool Controllers 
if the interface agreed upon is standard, flexible and open.

Example of Protocol Use

This section gives two examples, each using RPCP to achieve the 
service execution. These two examples are linked and the RPC of 
first becomes RP for the second example.

A.1.1 Example1

The section on need for RPCP describes the new architecture for 
telecom components with intelligence being moved away from 
switching fabric. The first example is based on such architecture.
In this example RP is the switching fabric and RPC is the 
signalling and call agent.

The configuration of resource and its capability may be known to 
RPC but if not, these are exchanged through protocol message 
between two. Following resources and capabilities are assumed

Resources: 
Bearer Circuits/Signalling Circuits/Switching Hardware or 
Firmware/Echo Cancellation Firmware

Capabilities: 
Bearer Circuits can be switched/Echo Cancellation can be applied 
to any Bearer circuit/Signalling Data can be extracted from 
Signalling Circuits and passed to RPC.

 --------                                          ------------

All SS7 signalling traffic will be send to RPC by RP using the 
real-time communication channel(it can be any connection type 
between RP and RPC, a local high-speed bus, high-speed ethernet 
etc.). RPC executing the SS7 Protocol, if required to use bearer

circuits or apply echo cancellation on these circuits, will issue 
such command by another service execute logic to RP. The switching
of bearer circuits is controlled by RPC using execute service 
logic command to RP.

For any error, like hardware failure for signalling channels, it 
will be reported to RPC using error report.

RPC may initially download the configuration data to RP, if 
required.

RPC will send an execute logic command to enable the SS7 signalling
on RP and send the logic to update execution results by setting 
the frequency of update for statistics, alarms and call records.

The RP will send updates to RPC for statistics with the frequency
specified and send any alarms as events to RPC, generate Call 
records and update RPC at the frequency specified.

 --------                                          ------------

In this example SS7 node (RP) in turn be using RPCP to control the
switching fabric to achieve the SS7 signalling capability. This 
shows the hierarchical application of RPCP protocol.
