Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                June 2008


1.  Introduction

   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) provides information to support
   admission control and flow termination in order to protect the
   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows.  This is achieved by
   marking packets according to the level of pre-congestion at nodes
   within the PCN-domain.  Two algorithms exist for that purpose.
   Excess traffic marking marks all PCN packets exceeding a certain
   reference rate on a link while threshold marking marks all PCN
   packets on a link when the PCN traffic rate exceeds the reference
   rate.  These markings are evaluated by the egress nodes of the PCN-
   domain.  [PCN-arch] describes how PCN packet markings can be used to
   assure the QoS of inelastic flows within a single DiffServ domain.

   This document specifies how these PCN marks are encoded into the IP
   header.  It also describes how packets are identified as belonging to
   a PCN flow.  Some deployment models require two PCN encoding states,
   others require three.  The baseline encoding described here only
   provides for two PCN encoding states.  An extended encoding described
   in [PCN-3-enc-state] provides for three PCN encoding states.

   o  Not PCN - packets that are not PCN capable.

   o  PCN-marked - codepoint indicating packets that have been marked at
      a PCN interior node using some PCN marking behaviour.  Also PM.

   o  Not-Marked - codepoint indicating packets that are PCN capable but
      are not PCN-marked.  Also NM.

   o  PCN-Capable codepoints - collective term for all the NM and PM
      codepoints.

   o  PCN enabled Diffserv codepoint - a Diffserv codepoint for which
      PCN has been enabled on a particular machine.

   In addition the document uses the terminology described in
   [PCN-arch].


4.  Encoding two PCN States in IP

   The PCN encoding states are defined using a combination of the DSCP
   field and ECN field in the IP header.  The baseline PCN encoding
   closely follows the semantics of ECN [RFC3168].  It allows the
   encoding of two PCN states: Not Marked and PCN-Marked.  It also
   allows for traffic that is not PCN capable to be marked as such (not-
   PCN).  The following table defines how to encode these states in IP:

      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
      |  DSCP  | Not-ECT (00) | ECT(0) (10) | ECT(1) (01) | CE (11) |
      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+
      | DSCP n |    not-PCN   |      NM     |      NM     |    PM   |
      +--------+--------------+-------------+-------------+---------+

    Where DSCP n is a PCN-enabled DiffServ codepoint (see Section 4.2)

                        Table 1: Encoding PCN in IP

   The following rules apply to all PCN traffic:

   o  PCN traffic MUST be marked with a DiffServ codepoint that
      indicates PCN is enabled.  To conserve DSCPs, DiffServ Codepoints
      SHOULD be chosen that are already defined for use with admission
      controlled traffic, such as the Voice-Admit codepoint defined in
      [voice-admit].

   o  Any packet that is not PCN capable (not-PCN) but which shares the
      same DiffServ codepoint as PCN capable traffic MUST have the ECN
      field set to 00.



Moncaster, et al.       Expires December 25, 2008               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                June 2008


   o  Any packet that belongs to a PCN capable flow MUST have the ECN
      field set to one of the two ECT codepoints 10 or 01 at the PCN-
      ingress-node.

   o  Any packet that is PCN capable and has been PCN-marked by a PCN-
      interior-node MUST have the ECN field set to 11.

4.1.  Rationale for Encoding

   The exact choice of encoding was dictated by the constraints imposed
   by existing IETF RFCs, in particular [RFC3168] and [RFC4774].  Full
   details are contained in [pcn-enc-compare].  One of the tightest
   constraints was the need for any PCN encoding to survive being
   tunnelled through either an IP in IP tunnel or an IPSec Tunnel.
   Appendix A explains this in detail.  The main effect of this
   constraint was that any PCN marking has to use the ECN field set to
   11 (CE codepoint).  If the packet is being tunneled then only the CE
   codepoint gets copied into the inner header upon decapsulation.  An
   additional constraint was the need to minimise the use of DiffServ
   codepoints as these are in increasingly short supply.  Section 4.2
   explains how we have minimised this still further by reusing pre-
   existing Diffserv codepoint(s) such that non-PCN traffic can still be
   distinguished from PCN traffic.

   The encoding scheme (Table 1) that best addresses the above
   constraints ends up looking very similar to ECN.  This is perhaps not
   surprising given the similarity in architectural intent between PCN
   and ECN.

4.2.  PCN-Enabled DiffServ Codepoints

   Equipment complying with the baseline PCN encoding MUST allow PCN to
   be enabled for a certain Diffserv codepoint or codepoints.  This
   document defines the term 'PCN-Enabled Diffserv Codepoint' for such a
   DSCP.  Enabling PCN for a DSCP switches on PCN marking behaviour for
   packets with that DSCP, but only if those packets also have their ECN
   field set to a codepoint other than not-PCN.

   Enabling PCN marking behaviour disables any other marking behaviour
   (e.g. enabling PCN also disables the default ECN marking behaviour
   introduced in [RFC3168]).  The scheduling behaviour used for a packet
   does not change whether PCN is enabled for a DSCP or not and whatever
   the setting of the ECN field.

4.2.1.  Implications of re-using a DiffServ Codepoint

   [RFC4774] requires that packets for which alternate ECN semantics
   (PCN semantics) are used are clearly distinguished from packets to



Moncaster, et al.       Expires December 25, 2008               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                June 2008


   which the semantics according to [RFC3168] apply.  This is done by
   using a DSCP to indicate that the ECN field is to be interpreted in
   the PCN context instead of the ECN context by PCN-enabled nodes.
   Non-PCN-enabled forwarding nodes outside or inside the PCN domain
   treat packets with a PCN-enabled DSCP like ECN traffic if appropriate
   ECN codepoints are set in the IP header.  This has several
   consequences.

   o  Care must be taken that the PCN encoding of packets is not falsely
      interpreted by forwarding nodes as ECN encoding, and that no harm
      is done if this were to happen.  To that end, appropriate marking
      and re-marking is performed at the ingress and the egress of a PCN
      domain.

   o  The re-used DSCP should be able to serve its original purpose
      which was not PCN support.  This is achieved by marking the
      packets of such flows with a not-PCN codepoint.

   o  The scheduling behaviour is coupled with the DSCP only.
      Therefore, the same scheduling and buffer management rules are
      applied for non-PCN-capable and PCN-capable traffic using the same
      PCN-enabled DSCP.

   o  Once the ECN field of a packet is used for PCN encoding, it has
      lost its previous information unless this information was
      tunnelled through the PCN domain.  Therefore, the baseline PCN
      encoding disables ECN for PCN-enabled DSCPs.  [PCN-3-enc-state]
      provides end-to-end ECN support where this is needed.

4.3.  Valid and Invalid Encoding Transitions at a PCN Node

   PCN edge node behaviour compliant with the PCN baseline encoding:

   o  Any packets with the ECN field already marked as CE or ECT
      arriving at a PCN ingress node SHOULD be dropped or alternatively
      MAY be tunnelled through the PCN-domain.  They MUST NOT be
      admitted to the PCN-domain directly.

   o  On leaving the PCN-domain the ECN bits MUST be set to 00 (Not
      ECT).

   PCN interior node behaviour compliant with the PCN baseline encoding:

   o  PCN Interior nodes MUST NOT change not-PCN to another codepoint
      and they MUST NOT change a PCN-Capable codepoint to not-PCN.

   o  PCN interior nodes that are in a pre-congestion state above the
      configured level MUST set the PM codepoint by changing the ECN

      bits of NM marked packets to 11.

   o  The PM codepoint MUST NOT be changed to NM.


5.  Backwards Compatability

   BCP 124 [RFC4774] gives guidelines for specifying alternative
   semantics for the ECN field.  It sets out a number of factors that
   must be taken into consideration.  It also suggests various
   techniques to allow the co-existence of default ECN and alternative
   ECN semantics.  The alternative semantics specified here are
   compliant with this BCP:

   o  they use a DSCP to allow routers to distinguish that traffic uses
      the alternate ECN semantics;

   o  these semantics are defined for use within a controlled domain;

   o  ECN marked traffic is blocked from entering the PCN domain
      directly (though it might be tunnelled through the domain).


6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request to IANA.  It does however suggest a
   change to the default ([RFC3168]) behaviour for the ECN field for the
   Voice-Admit [voice-admit] DSCP.


7.  Security Considerations

   Packets claim entitlement to be PCN marked by carrying a PCN-enabled
   DSCP and a PCN-Capable ECN codepoint.  This encoding document is
   intended to stand independently of the architecture used to determine
   whether specific packets are authorised to be PCN marked, which will
   be described in a future separate document on PCN edge-node
   behaviour.  The PCN working group has initially been chartered to
   only consider a PCN-domain to be entirely under the control of one
   operator, or a set of operators who trust each other [PCN-charter].
   However there is a requirement to keep inter-domain scenarios in mind
   when defining the PCN encoding.  One way to extend to multiple
   domains would be to concatenate PCN-domains and use PCN-boundary-
   nodes back to back at borders.  Then any one domain's security
   against its neighbours would be described as part of the edge-node
   behaviour document as above.  One proposal on the table allows one to
   extend PCN across multiple domains without PCN edge nodes back-to-
   back at borders [re-PCN].  It is believed that the encoding described

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                June 2008


   here would not be incompatible with the security framework described
   there.


8.  Conclusions

   This document defines the baseline PCN encoding utilising a
   combination of a PCN-enabled DSCP and the ECN field in the IP header.
   This baseline encoding allows the existence of two PCN encoding
   states, Not Marked and PCN-Marked.  It also allows for the co-
   existence of non-PCN traffic within the same DSCP.  The encoding
   scheme is conformant with [RFC4774].

Appendix A.  Tunnelling Constraints

   The rules that govern the behaviour of the ECN field for IP-in-IP
   tunnels were defined in [RFC3168].  This allowed for two tunnel modes
   to exist.  The limited functionality mode sets the outer header to
   Not ECT, regardless of the value of the inner header.  The full
   functionality mode copies the inner ECN field into the outer header
   if the inner header is Not ECT or either of the 2 ECT codepoints.  If
   the inner header is CE then the outer header is set to ECT(0).  On
   decapsulation, if the CE codepoint is set on the outer header then
   this is copied into the inner header.  Otherwise the inner header is
   left unchanged.  The apparent reason for blocking CE from being
   copied to the outer header was to prevent this from being used as a
   covert channel through IPSec tunnels.



Moncaster, et al.       Expires December 25, 2008               [Page 9]

Internet-Draft            Baseline PCN Encoding                June 2008


   The IPSec protocol [RFC4301] changed the ECN tunnelling rule to allow
   IPSec tunnels to simply copy the inner header into the outer header.
   On decapsulation the outer header is discarded and the ECN field is
   only copied down if it is set to CE.  Because of the possible
   existence of tunnels, only CE (11) can be used as a PCN marking as it
   is the only mark that will survive decapsulation.

   There is a further issue involving tunnelling.  In RFC3168, IP in IP
   tunnels are expected to set the ECN field to ECT(0) if the inner ECN
   field is set to CE.  This leads to the possibility that some packets
   within the PCN field that have already been marked may have that mark
   concealed further into the domain.  This is undesirable for many PCN
   schemes and thus standard IP in IP tunnels SHOULD NOT be used within
   a PCN-domain.


Appendix B.  Deployment Scenarios for PCN Using Baseline Encoding

   We illustrate the use of PCN baseline encoding for different PCN
   deployment scenarios and explain also a case for which baseline
   encoding is not applicable. {Note this appendix is provided for
   information only}

   1.  An operator may wish to use PCN-based admission control only.  To
       that end, threshold marking based on admissible rates may be used
       as the only PCN metering and marking algorithm.  As a
       consequence, the packet marks M are interpreted as admission-stop
       (AS) marks.  The admission-control algorithm is based on
       "admissible-rate overload".

   2.  An operator may wish to use PCN-based flow termination only.  To
       that end, excess rate marking based on supportable rates may be
       used as the only PCN metering and marking algorithm.  As a
       consequence, the packet marks M are interpreted as excess-traffic
       (ET) marks.  The flow termination algorithm is based on
       "supportable-rate overload".

   3.  An operator may wish to use both PCN-based admission control and
       flow termination.  To that end, excess rate marking based on
       admissible rates may be used as the only PCN metering and marking
       algorithm.  As a consequence, the packet marks are interpreted as
       admission-stop (AS) marks.  Both the admission control and the
       flow termination algorithm are based on "admissible-rate
       overload".

   4.  An operator may wish to implement admission control based on
       threshold marking at admissible rates and flow termination based
       on excess rate marking at supportable rates because these methods

       are believed to work better with small ingress-egress aggregates.
       Then two different markings are needed that cannot be recorded by
