Abstract

The Content Network Advertisement Protocol (CNAP) is a protocol 
Intended to facilitate the interconnection of Content Networks 
(CN). CNAP is a simple CN-to-CN information exchange protocol 
that advertises both content and area advertisements. These two 
types of advertisements are described in [3,6] and are intended 
to be used by content network request routing systems [9]. The 
exchange of these advertisements between CNs is intended to 
facilitate inter-CN request-routing decisions.

1. Introduction

The document provides the specifications of the Content Network
Advertisement Protocol (CNAP), which is designed to facilitate 
the interconnection of separately administered Content Networks
[9]. In this work, the term, Content Network (CN), refers to a 
collection of network elements that assist in the distribution,
location, delivery and usage-tracking of content [9]. In [9] a 
CN is generally composed of a set of surrogates and three 
principal architectural components: a Distribution System, a 
Request-Routing System and an Accounting System. The CNs 
interconnects through a Content Internetworking Gateway 
(CIG) that supports the three architectural components. The 
source CN for a given content is the Authoritative CN for that 
content. A content provider can be the Authoritative CN provided 
that it supports at least a request-routing system [9].

This document defines a simple advertisement protocol that is 
intended to communicate information for the purpose of performing 
request routing [3] decisions between interconnected CNs. CNAP is 
not a routing protocol but can be used to exchange information 
that may be used for inter-CN request-routing decisions.

This document includes the following:

 - An overview the necessary protocols needed to interconnect 
   content networks and where CNAP fits in this model. 

 - An overview of how CNAP can interface to the other (as not yet 
   defined)content networking protocols such as a content 
   distribution protocol [8].  

 - An overview of the context for CNAP.

 - The specification of CNAP and its operation.

CNAP primary role is to exchange request-routing information 
Between CNs; this information may be used to facilitate inter-CN 
request-routing decisions. CNAP is used to advertise:

 - Advertisement of Content served by a CN using content
   advertisements. Content advertisements may include a number 
   of attributes concerning the content.

 - Advertisement of CN information about aspects of topology, 
   geography and performance using area advertisements.  Area
   advertisements may include a number of attributes/metrics 
   relating to a CN's topology.

2. CNAP Architectural and Operational Overview

This section outlines the context for CNAP and the various steps 
and protocols that are needed to perform basic interconnection 
between content networks.  Furthermore, the section provides the 
basis for understanding the specific problems that the CNAP 
protocol is addressing.  In section 3 the specification for CNAP 
is provided.


2.1 Overview
   
The interconnection of CNs must be performed in multiple steps 
and requires the exchange of multiple types of information. In 
particular, there are three steps of CN interconnection:

  1. The first step in interconnecting CNs starts when one CN 
     requests the distribution of particular content on a 
     neighboring CN. This task can be performed manually or 
     through a set of automated protocol(s). This step
     must provide various attributes of the content to be 
     distributed such as its origin and invalidation scheme. The 
     requesting CN is the authoritative CN for that content. 
     This step is also called Request for Distribution.

  2. After performing step 1, the two CNs must exchange 
     information about the content that they have agreed to 
     distribute. In particular, the two CNs must exchange 
     readiness and metric information about the content
     between them. Other information that is necessary to 
     perform request-routing decisions (i.e. request 
     redirection) must also be advertised. The information might 
     include metrics such as Latency, Packet Loss, and 
     Hop Counts. In [12], a detailed list of metric information 
     that can be used in performing request-routing decisions is
     provided. The advertisement of such information is the 
     purpose of the Content and Network Advertisement Protocol
     (CNAP). The details of CNAP are described in this document.

Internet-Draft               CNAP                           August 2002

  3. The third step consists of the task of ensuring that the 
     content is up to date between the two interconnected CNs. 
     In this regard, it is necessary for the authoritative CN 
     to ensure that content on the neighboring CN is updated 
     in a proper manner. This task may require a cache 
     invalidation or meta-data protocol exchange.  

The next sections provide more detailed description of the steps 
that are needed to interconnect CNs as part of the CNAP protocol. 
The document focus on the CNAP protocol and does not detail the steps 
that are needed to perform a routing decision. 

2.2 Request for Distribution Step

We refer to the first step in above process as the distribution 
request phase. This can be handled manually or through an 
automated protocol(s).

In this phase, a CIG requests the distribution of content from a 
neighboring CIG (associated with another CN).  This step can be 
automated by the use of a content distribution request protocol.  
This protocol is responsible for providing:

 - A request/response mechanism to ask a neighbor CN to advertise 
   content.
 - The required information for retrieving the content (e.g. 
   origin).
 - The required information for properly accounting for the 
   content.
 - The invalidation channel to receive invalidations and meta-
   data updates for the content.


2.3 Information Exchange and Inter-CN Request-Routing Step

Once a CN has agreed to distribute content for another CN, then 
each CN must exchange two types of information in order to 
determine whether a request (or set of requests) will be handed 
to a neighbor CN.

Each CN exchanges two types of information with the neighboring CNs.  
The two types of information are area advertisements and content 
advertisements.  These advertisements allow a CN to determine the 
availability of content as well as the health/performance of a neighbor 
CN.  This information is used to make inter-CN request-routing decisions.
The CNAP is a simple advertisement protocol that will be used for 
exchanging information between CNs.

2.3.1 CIG Abstract Model

Neighboring CNs are interconnected through CIGs. The CNAP protocol runs 
on CIGs. A CIGs contains several basic components that are depicted in 
Figure 1.  Next a brief description of the components is provided.

                     Figure 1. Content Routing Components


  1. Content Topology Database (CTD)

  The Content Topology Database consists [6] of three distinct 
  components:

  a) Content routing information that has been learned from 
     inbound CNAP advertisement messages. They carry routes that 
     are available as an input to the Route Computation Process.

  b) Content routing information on which the CN is Authoritative 
     on and that has been selected by applying local policies to the 
     routing Information in step a) and stored in the Content 
     Routing Matrix.

  c) The information that CNAP advertises to other interconnected 
     CNs.

Internet-Draft               CNAP                           August 2002


  Each CNs has to keep track of the list of content for which it is 
  authoritative.

  2. Route Computation Process (RCP)

  The Route Computation process is responsible for: 

  - Keeping track of newly learned AREAs and CONTENTs that can be 
    reached by other CNs,

  - Keeping track of newly distributed CONTENTs/AREAs of the CN 
    that have to be advertised to content level peers, and

  - Updating the Content FIB accordingly. 

  3. Local Content Routing Matrix (LCRM)

  This matrix is local to each CN. It contains information about 
  content learned from the Distribution System and is used to 
  route requests to local surrogates that will actually serve the 
  content.

  4. Content Forwarding Information Base (CFIB)

  This database is constructed using the content information that 
  is available in CTD and LCRM. The information in this database 
  indicates to the RRS system of the CN when requests to a given 
  content must be forwarded to other peered CNs or served 
  locally.

2.4 Content Meta-Data Updates Step

Once content has agreed to be distributed and is being advertised 
by a neighboring CN, there must exist a way to update meta-data 
related to that content. An example of this step is the
information that is required to invalidate content.

The primary differences between the type of information 
advertised in CNAP and the types advertised in meta-data updates 
are:

	- CNAP advertises *CN* aggregate information to its 
        neighbors.  A meta-data update protocol would advertise 
        *content* specific updates.  In other words, CNAP updates 
        are always with respect to the network itself.

Internet-Draft               CNAP                           August 2002

	- CNAP content advertisements are expected to be long-
        lived. A meta-data update protocol would advertise 
        potentially short-lived information (e.g. content 
        expiration times).  A meta-data update protocol would 
        advertise frequent updates where CNAP is intended for 
        only network-wide infrequent updates (e.g. now 
        distributing new content set).


3. Content Advertisement Protocol (CNAP)

3.1 Introduction
   
This section provides an overview, operation, and detailed 
protocol specification for the Content Network Advertisement 
Protocol (CNAP).

The primary function of CNAP is to exchange content and 
reachability information as it relates to Content Networks.  
Reachability applies to both network reachability and content 
reachability.  

CNAP is a CN to CN protocol and makes use of TCP as a reliable 
transport protocol.  TCP is used due to the large amounts of 
information that must be exchanged using CNAP. Furthermore, the 
number of CNAP connections is small since CNAP is used for 
connecting overlay networks.

Information exchanged between CNs using CNAP is communicated on a 
neighbor-by-neighbor basis. That is, a CIG may filter information 
based on policies configured by the CIG administrator.

3.2 Information Types

CNAP advertises information for the following purposes:

- The readiness (or not) of a CN to serve content

- How the authoritative CN should redirect requests to the CN.

- Information that may be used for inter-CN request-routing 
  decisions.
 
The above information is advertised in two types of 
advertisements:

- Content Advertisements: Advertisement from a content network's 
  request-routing  system about the availability of one or more 
  collections of content on a content network. These 
  advertisements are keyed on URLs that specify content.
  They specify the readiness to serve sets of content as well as 
  other information required for inter-CN request routing.

Internet-Draft               CNAP                           August 2002

- Area Advertisements: Advertisement from a content network's 
  request-routing system about aspects of topology, geography and 
  performance of a CN.  These advertisements specify information
  related to making an informed inter-CN request routing 
  decision. These are keyed on IP prefix/length pairs and 
  contain metrics from a CN to those prefixes. 

NOTE: Need to add IP v6 info.

3.3 CNAP Protocol Overview

CNAP is a simple point-to-point (CIG to CIG) advertisement 
protocol to be used for exchanging CN information. CNAP does not 
specify actual inter-CN request-routing algorithms but is 
intended to be used as an information exchange protocol for the 
purpose of inter-CN request routing. 

CNAP is a text-based protocol using TCP as its underlying 
transport mechanism using port number TBD. A single CNAP 
connection exists between a set of CIGs.

CNAP makes use of the concept of a Content Network Autonomous 
System (CNAS).  A CNAS is an identifier assigned through an 
address authority on a per content network basis. It is similar to 
the Autonomous System (AS) identifier used in inter-domain IP 
routing.

Initially, CNAP is specified for DNS-based request-routing 
systems. For this reason, this document specifies the 
Redirection Parameter Set for DNS-based request routing.  
However, CNAP is extensible for other request-routing types.

The high-level protocol design of CNAP and connection state 
machine borrows from BGP-4 [13]. It includes four types of 
messages: OPEN, KEEPALIVE, NOTIFY, ADVERTISE. CNAP includes the 
notion of a "Content Autonomous System" (Content AS).  A Content 
Autonomous System is a single administrative CN.  The Content 
Autonomous System is included in a number of CNAP protocol 
messages.

CNAP is designed to be extensible to support new attributes, 
metrics, and advertisement types.


3.4 CNAP Connections

CNAP connections must be explicitly configured by an 
administrator (this is similar to BGP).  Before a CNAP session 
can be established the operators of the CIGs involved in a CNAP 
session have to establish:



Cain, et. al.           Expires August 25, 2002             page [8]

Internet-Draft               CNAP                          August 2002

  - Local CNAS
  - Local CIG IP address
  - Neighbor CNAS
  - Neighbor CIG IP address
  - Security credentials
  - And any advertisement filtering policies	

After this information has been configured either site MAY 
initiate a CNAP session by establishing a TCP connection and 
exchanging CNAP messages as described in the next section.  A 
CNAP connection is fully established only when the connection 
enters the READY state.

After the CNAP connection enters the READY state, it may begin 
exchanging network and/or content reachability information.
 
In order to prevent redundant TCP connections between CIGs, the 
CIG with the lowest IP address wins in a tie-breaking situation.  
If a CIG detects multiple connections to a neighbor the one with 
the lowest IP address "wins" the election; that is, the 
connection initiated from the CIG with the lowest IP address is 
kept.  The other is torn down.
 
3.5 CNAP Messages and Formats

CNAP is text-based, using ISO 10646 in UTF-8 encoding (RFC 2279 [13]).
This allows easy of debugging and makes CNAP flexible and extensible. The 
following are used within CNAP messages:

NOTE: Need to add IP v6 info.

	CNAP-URI		   = URI-PARAMETERS
	PROTOCOL-VERSION	   = 1*3DIGIT ; 0 TO 255
	CNAS			   = 1*16DIGIT ; 
	HOLDTIME		   = 1*3 DIGIT ; 0 TO 255
	DISTRIB-LEVEL-TYPES  = ("MULTIPLE" | "SINGLE")
	RRS-TYPE		   = ("DNS-CNAME")
      IP-VERSION           = ("4" | "6")
	IPV4-ADDRESS	   = 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT "." 
                             1*DIGIT
	IPV4-MASK	   	   = 1*DIGIT
      IPV6-PARAMETER       = TBD
	OTHER-PARAM		   = (token | (token "=" (token | 
                              QUOTED- STRING)))
	ADVERT-TYPE		   = ("AREA" | "CONTENT")
	CONTENT-AS-PATH	   = *((1*5DIGIT) [","])
	AREA-LIST		   = *((IPV4-ADDRESS "&" IPV4-MASK)[","])
	ERROR-DATA		   = *(ALPHANUM)
	STATUS-TYPE		   = ("ADD" | "WITHDRAW")
	REGION-ID-LIST	   = *((1*16DIGIT) [","])
	REGION-ID            = *((1*32DIGIT) [","])
	RDIR-VALUE		   = *(ALPHANUM)

Internet-Draft               CNAP                        August 2002

  
In general, CNAP messages consist of a start-line, a header 
field (also known as "message-header"), and an empty line 
indicating the end of the header field.


   generic-message	=	start-line
					[message-header]
					CRLF

The start-line, each message-header line, and the empty line MUST 
be terminated by a carriage-return line-feed sequence (CRLF).  Note 
that the empty line MUST be present.

3.5.1 Message Header Fields

Each CNAP message contains a small one-line header that includes 
the message type.  Each message type has its own unique header. 

There are three types of header fields, mainly:
   "open-header", 
   "notification-header", 
   "advertisement-header".

The syntax of the message header is given below:

   message-header		=	( open-header
					| notification-header
					| advertisement-header )
   

The message-header fields follow the same generic header format as 
that given in section 3.1 of RFC 822 [X].  Each header field 
consists of a name followed by a colon (":") and the field value.  
Field names are case-insensitive.  The field value MAY be 
preceded by any amount of leading white space (LWS), though a 
single space (SP) is preferred.  

Header fields can be extended over multiple lines by preceding each 
extra line with at least one SP or horizontal tab (HT). CIGs MUST 
follow HTTP "common form" when generating these constructs.

    Message-header = field-name ":" [field-value] CRLF
    Field-name = token
    Field-value = *(field-content |LWS)
    Field-content = <the OCTETs making up the field-value and 
                    consisting of either TEXT-UTF8 or combinations 
                    of token, separators and quoted string>

3.5.2 Message Types

Each CNAP message contains a small one-line header defined by:

   start-line	=	Method CRLF

Each method corresponds to a CNAP message type.  The Method token 
is case-sensitive.

	Method = "OPEN" | "NOTIFY" | "ADVERTISEMENT" | "KEEPALIVE"

   
The following sections describe CNAP messages and the content of 
these messages.  

3.5.2.1 OPEN

The OPEN message is sent by each CIG in a CNAP session to 
initiate and establish the CNAP protocol connection.  Each CIG 
sends an OPEN message as soon as the TCP connection is 
established.  An OPEN message contains an open-header:

   open-header	= PROTOCOL-VERSION
			| NODE-ID
			| CNAS
			| HOLDTIME
			| DISTRIB-LEVEL  
			| RRS-TYPES


where,

- Protocol-Version
CNAP protocol version number running on the CIG gateway.

	PROTOCOL-VERSION = "Protocol-Version" ":" Protocol-Version

- NODE-ID
The Node ID is an unique IP address of the CIG. 

	NODE-ID = " NODE-ID" ":" IPV4-ADDRESS, or
	NODE-ID = " NODE-ID" ":" IPV6-ADDRESS 

- CNAS
The Content Network Autonomous System that uniquely identifies this

3.5.2.2 KEEPALIVE

KEEPALIVE messages are sent according to the period specified for 
HOLDTIME in the OPEN message.  No parameters are supported for 
KEEPALIVE messages.   KEEPALIVE messages are used to acknowledge 
OPEN messages.  After a CIG receives a KEEPALIVE in response to 
its OPEN, it enters the ESTABLISHED state assuming that its 
neighbor is ready to begin receiving advertisements.

   A KEEPALIVE message contains no specific method header.


3.5.2.3 NOTIFY

NOTIFY messages are sent to indicate an error has occurred.  The 
sender will move to the Idle state immediately after sending the 
NOTIFY message. 

   notify-header	=   ERROR-CODE
			  | ERROR-SUBCODE
			  | ERROR-DATA
	
where,

- ERROR-CODE

Error code indicates the type of notification.

	Error-Code = "Error-Code" ":" 3DIGIT

            104 - Finite State Machine Violation 
            105 - Session Shutdown 


The following are currently defined error sub-codes:

       OPEN Error Subcodes 

            1 - Protocol Version not supported 
	      2 - Different distribution levels
            3 - Mandatory CNAPability not provided

3.5.2.4  ADVERTISE

ADVERTISE messages contains the actual content and CN 
information. They are used to advertise positive status as well 
as to withdraw information.

Content and Area ADVERTISE messages are "linked" through 
Region IDs (RID).  A RID is a 32-bit unsigned integer assigned to one 
or more IP prefixes.  If a Content ADVERTISE message contains RID, it 
means "this content is available in these areas with these RIDs".

			        | AUTHORITATIVE-CN
			        | CN-PATH
				  | (AREA-HEADER | CONTENT-HEADER)

- ADVERTISEMENT-TYPE

This specifies the type of advertisement.

	ADVERTISEMENT-TYPE = "ADVERTISEMENT-TYPE" ":" ADVERT-TYPE

- AUTHORITATIVE-CN

The CAS number of the CN authoritative for the CONTENT or 
AREA being advertised in this message.

	AUTHORITATIVE-CN = "AUTHORITATIVE-CN" ":" CONTENTAS

- CN-PATH

Attribute that is composed of a sequence of CAS numbers.

	CN-PATH = "CN-PATH" ":" CONTENT-AS-PATH
	
The following sections describe the details of each of the 
advertisement types above.  An "area" advertisement includes an 
area-header that is a list of areas (and their metrics) being 
advertised.  A "content" advertisement includes a content-header 
that is a list of content (and its metrics) being advertised. 


3.5.2.4.1 ADVERTISE: Content

Content advertisements are used to advertise information relating 
to content.  This information advertises the status and related 
request routing information related to content.

   content-header	=  CONTENT-SET
			  | STATUS
			  | REGION-LIST
			  | TTL
			  | REDIRECTION-INFO

- Content-Set

The content set specifies a set of URL's or URL prefixes. The granularity 
of the content-set might depend on the redirection-type if  defined.

	CONTENT-SET = "CONTENT-SET" ":" *( (CNAP-URI) [","] )

Internet-Draft               CNAP                           August 2002

- Status

The status of the content set for the advertising CN.  
            The status-type may be either "ready" or "withdraw".  
            Ready indicates the CN can accept request for content 
            within the content-set.  Withdraw indicates
            that requests for content within the content-set 
            should not be sent to the advertising CN.

	Status = "Status" ":" status-type

- Region-List

List of 16-bit region IDs for which the content is available. 

	Region-List = "Region-List" ":" region-id-list

- TTL

Indicates for how long the CN will be ready for content in the content 
set in minutes.

	TTL = "TTL" ":" 32DIGITS

If a content advertisement indicates a Status of "ready", 
then REDIRECTION-INFO is also supplied in the advertisement.

   REDIRECTION-INFO =   REDIRECTION-TYPE
			    | REDIRECTION-VALUE

   where,

    - Redirection-Type
      Type of redirection parameter set used.

	REDIRECTION-TYPE = "REDIRECTION-TYPE" ":" RRS-TYPE
		      
    - Redirection-Value

      Value of redirection parameter set (terminated by CRLF like 
      other headers). See Section 4 for the structure of the 
      Redirection value for cname based request routing systems.

	REDIRECTION-VALUE = "REDIRECTION-VALUE" ":" RDIR-VALUE
 
If a content advertisement indicates a Status of "withdraw", then 
REDIRECTION-INFO is also supplied in the advertisement.

   REDIRECTION-INFO = WITHDRAW-EFFECTIVE

    where,

     - WITHDRAW-EFFECTIVE
       When the withdraw will be effective (might be 0).  
       A withdraw MAY withdraw content before the TTL in a 
       previous ready message is reached. If the TTL 
       in the ready message is reached the  content is considered 
       withdrawn.

	WITHDRAW-EFFECTIVE = "WITHDRAW-EFFECTIVE" ":" 32DIGITS


3.5.2.4.2 ADVERTISE: Area

Area advertisements communicate metrics for areas that are 
accessible via the advertising CN. 

   area-header	=   AREA-SET
			  | STATUS
			  | REGION-LIST
			  | TTL
			  | METRIC-LIST


   Area-Set: 

List of IP prefixes pairs for which the advertisement holds.

	AREA-SET = "AREA-SET" ":" AREA-LIST
	
- Status

The status of the area set for the advertising CN. The status-type 
may be either "ready" or "withdraw". Ready indicates the CN can accept 
request for the IP prefixes within the area-set.  Withdraw indicates 
that requests for content within the area-set should not be sent to 
the advertising CN.

	STATUS = "STATUS" ":" STATUS-TYPE

- Region-List

List of 32-bit region IDs for which the that are identified with the 
area set. 

	REGION-LIST = "REGION-LIST" ":" REGION-ID-LIST

- TTL 

Indicates for how long the CN the area advertisement is valid in 
minutes.

	TTL = "TTL" ":" 32DIGITS

If an Area ADVERTISE message indicates a Status of "ready", then 
metric-list is also part of the area-header.

       METRIC-LIST = *(METRIC)

       METRIC = METRIC-TYPE| METRIC-VALUE

       where,

       - Metric-Type
         
         Type of metric reported.

	       METRIC-TYPE = "METRIC-TYPE" ":" 16DIGIT
   
       - Metric-Value
      
         Value of metric; depends on type.

	       METRIC-VALUE = "METRIC-VALUE" ":" *(ALPHANUM)

3.6 Error Handling

3.6.1 Session Initiation Collision

If an OPEN is received for a CN for which the CIG has another 
session established the CN with the higher CN number will send a 
NOTIFY message and move to the Idle state. 

3.6.2 Protocol Version Negotiation

Each CIG initially specifies the highest Protocol Version it is 
capable of handling.  If the peer does not support this version, 
it sends a NOTIFY indicating the protocol version is not 
supported, and changes it's state to Idle. Either CIG may 
optionally re-establish the connection and specify a lower 
Protocol Version. 

Editor Note: we need to specify more error conditions.


3.7 Finite State Machine

State is defined on a per peer basis, where a peer is Content 
Internetworking Gateway. 

3.7.1 State Names

The following states are defined. 

      Init - No connection established. 



Cain, et. al.           Expires August 25, 2002             page [17]

Internet-Draft               CNAP                           August 2002

      OpenSent - An OPEN message has been sent. 

      OpenConfirm - OPEN messages exchanged; confirmation 
                    required. 

      Ready - Session is established. 

3.7.2 State Table

The following defines the state table.  For each state, the 
messages, which are valid in that state, are listed.  The "Next 
State After Success" column indicates the state entered after the 
message indicated in "Message Sent" is sent. If a message not 
specified for the state is received, the receiver will move to 
the Idle state, with the following exceptions: 

 - A NOTIFY message is always followed by the sender moving to 
   the Idle state. 

 - AREA, CONTENT messages may only be sent in the Ready
   state and do not cause a state change. 

The OPEN sent in the Idle state MUST be sent by the initiator or 
The TCP connection between the CIG peers.  The OPEN sent in the 
OpenSent state MUST be sent by the receiver of the initial OPEN 
message. 

State                Message Sent        Next State After Success
--------             ------------        ---------------------
 Idle                  OPEN (initiator)      OpenSent
 OpenSent              OPEN                  OpenConfirm
 OpenConfirm           KEEPALIVE             Ready
 Ready                 KEEPALIVE             Ready

To move to the Idle state from any other state, the socket 
connection associated with this peer will be terminated.  Data 
collected from AREA and CONTENT advertisements is retained only 
as long as the session is maintained. 

When a session moves to Idle state, the CIG will update it's AREA 
and CONTENT tables according to the following rules. 

      For all AREA data received from a disconnected peer, AREA
      Status:Withdraw messages will be sent on remaining CNAP
      connections, and paths represented by the associated AREAs 
      will be deleted from local tables.

Internet-Draft               CNAP                           August 2002

4. Redirection parameter set: CNAME based DNS redirection  

The CNAME based DNS redirection parameter set is used if content 
is served by a CN, which uses CNAME, based DNS redirection. In 
this case the CN, which will serve the content, advertises in the 
READY message to the CN, which is authoritative for the DNS name 
of the content a CNAME. This CNAME MUST be used to redirect a DNS 
request from the authoritative CN to the CN advertising the CNAME 
if the authoritative CN wants to utilize the CN advertising the 
READY message. The parameter set is defined as:

- Redirection-Type

The redirection type should be specified as DNS CNAME.

      REDIRECTION-TYPE = "REDIRECTION-TYPE" ":" "DNS-CNAME"

- Redirection-Value

The CNAME to use for redirecting requests for content in the content set.

		REDIRECTION-VALUE = "REDIRECTION-VALUE" ":"
                                *(ALPHANUM)
   
If this redirection type is used the content set in a content 
advertisement MUST only be specified on the granularity of a DNS 
name.

5. Security Considerations

The IPSEC architecture [11] defines security services at the IP 
level which can be used by any higher layer protocol.  CNAP 
requires the ability to authenticate the session participants and 
to ensure the confidentiality of messages.  These services are 
provided through use of IPSEC's Authentication Header (AH) and 
Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP), respectively.  Because 
IPSEC targets providing services to security-unaware 
applications, CNAP requires only a mechanism to indicate to a 
peer that certain security services are required. 

Editor Note: expand details.

NOTES:
[bec] took out global CN info in CNAPabilities; will use 
0.0.0.0/0 to advertise metrics for entire CN (in area 
advertisement)

[bec] message definitions are still a bit confusing;  maybe we 
should simplify (and add stuff later)??

[bec] message definitions still need some work; need to reconcile 
with RFC2396 and RFC822

[bec] need to define all error types we can think of

[bec] took out list of content types in open message; I think 
this is better suited for distribution protocol.  If we put it 
back in then we should use standard mime types.  

[bec] left content AS path in all advertisements; even though we 
are just doing single level distribution now, I think it still 
makes sense as a mandatory requirement

[bec] need more details in protocol state machine; see bgp RFC.

[bec] took content type out of area advertisement; this makes 
things quite complex.
