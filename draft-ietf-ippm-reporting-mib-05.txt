1.                   Introduction 
   This memo defines a MIB for managing network measurements based upon 
   the IP performance metrics specified by the IPPM Working Group. 
    
   The definition of objects in the IPPM MIB are built on notions 
   introduced and discussed in the IPPM Framework document, RFC 2330 
   [ii]. 
    
   This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB), and as such it 
   is intended to be respectful of the "Boilerplate for IETF MIBs" 
   defined in http://www.ops.ietf.org/mib-boilerplate.html. 
    
   There are companion documents to the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB both in the 
   Transport Area (See section 2), and in the Operations and Management

   Area (See section 3). The reader should be familiar with these 
   documents.  
    
2.                   The IPPM Framework 
    
   The IPPM Framework consists of 3 major components: 
    
   A general framework for defining performance metrics, as described in 
   the Framework for IP Performance Metrics, RFC 2330 [2]; 
    
   A set of standardized metrics which conform to this framework: The 
   IPPM Metrics for Measuring Connectivity, RFC 2678 [iii]; The One-way 
   Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 2679 [iv]; The One-way Packet Loss Metric 
   for IPPM, RFC 2680 [v]; The Round-trip Delay Metric for IPPM, RFC 
   2681 [vi]; 
    
   Emerging metrics that are being specified in respect of this 
   framework. 
 
    
3.                   The SNMP Management Framework 
    
   The SNMP Management Framework consists of five major components: 
    
        An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2]. 
    
        Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 16, 
   RFC 1155 [3], STD 16, RFC 1212 [4] and RFC 1215 [5].  The second 
   version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [6], STD 58, 
   RFC 2579 [7] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [8]. 
    
        Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
   first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9]. A second version of the SNMP 
   message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, 
   is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [10] and RFC 1906 [11].  
   The third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and 
   described in RFC 1906 [11], RFC 2572 [12] and RFC 2574 [13]. 
    
        Protocol operations for accessing management information. The 
   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [9].  A second set of protocol 
   operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [14]. 
    
        A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [15] and 
   the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 [16]. 
    
   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework 
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              February 2004 
                                      
                                      
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
    
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine 
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the 
   MIB. 
 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) 
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an 
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.   
    
   The object type together with an object instance serves to uniquely 
   identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For human 
   convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to 
   refer to the object type.

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              February 2004 
                                      
                                      
    
 
4.                   Overview 
    
   Although the number of measurement devices that implement IPPM 
   metrics is growing, there is not currently any standardized 
   management interface to manage remotely the measurement of these 
   metrics. This memo defines a Management Information Base for managing 
   the measurement of IPPM metrics.  
    
   To permit metrics to be referenced by other MIBs and other protocols, 
   the IPPM WG has defined a registry of the current metrics and a 
   framework for the integration of future metrics in the [IPPM metrics 
   registry]. 
    
   As the specification of new metrics is a continuous process, this 
   memo defines a framework for the integration of the future 
   standardized metrics.  
    
   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB introduces a framework where each application 
   identifies its measures in an owner namespace. The administrator may 
   grant access to a measure, or set of measures to another owner via 
   view based access control. As a result, one owner may compute 
   aggregated metrics on another ownerÆs network measures. 
    
   Different architectures may be used to perform metric measurements, 
   using a control protocol and a test protocol. Different control 
   frameworks are suitable for performing measurements. The memo lists 
   them, while also looking for a way to integrate them with the IPPM-
   REPORTING-MIB. This section is for informational purposes only, and 
   is intended to help specify the relationship among the test protocol, 
   the control protocol and the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB. 
    
   Special care has been taken to provide a reporting mode suitable for 
   control protocols and test protocols. It addresses the need to 
   provide access to results for the applications. 
    
   This MIB is intended to handle multiple concurrent sessions by SNMP 
   applications. However, the SNMP requests are not necessarily to be 
   handled explicitly by the measurement devices, but can be sent to 
   middleware performing an aggregation function. This allows for 
   continuous collection of measurements and statistics computation. 
    
4.1.                     Textual Conventions 
    
      Eight types of data are introduced as textual conventions in this 
   document: IppmOwnerString, IppmOwnerIndex, TimeUnit, PacketType, 
   PacketTypeAddress, GMTTimeStamp, IppmStandardMetrics and 
   IppmMetricResultFilter. 
    
4.1.1   IppmOwnerString

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              February 2004 
                                      
                                      
    
    This octet string is used to represent the owners of the various 
    measures and reports in the measurement system.  
 
4.1.2   IppmOwnerIndex 
    
    This integer identifies an instance of an object in an owner 
    namespace. 
     
4.1.3   TimeUnit 
 
    This textual convention is used to indicate a unit of time, ranging 
    from nanosecond, microsecond, millisecond, second, hour, day, and 
    week. 
    
4.1.4   PacketType and PacketTypeAddress  
    
   Section 13 of the IPPM framework [2] introduces the generic notion of 
   a "packet of type P", because in some contexts the metric's value 
   depends on the type of the packets involved in the metric. In the 
   definition of a metric, the type P will be explicitly defined, 
   partially defined, or left generic. Measurement of metrics defined 
   with generic type P are made specific when performing actual 
   measurements. It is important that one be conscious of the exact type 
   of traffic being measured. 
    
   The standardization of the management of IPPM measures relies on the 
   capability to unambiguously configure the type P of the packets, and 
   the parameters of the protocol suites of the type P. 
    
   RMON2 introduced the concept of protocol identifiers.  RFC2895 [xxv] 
   specifies a macro for the definition of protocol identifier. The 
   RFC2896 [xxvi] defines the protocol identifiers for different 
   protocol encapsulation trees. 
    
   The type P implementation relies on the MACRO PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER 
   defined for identifying protocol suites in RMON2. It is achieved by 
   defining the PacketType and the PacketTypeAddress as new syntax in 
   SMIv2 TEXTUAL-CONVENTION. 
    
4.1.4.1 Internet addresses 
    
   The section 14 of the IPPM framework defines (for the usual case of a 
   unidirectional path through the Internet) the term "Src" and "Dst". 
   "Src" denotes the IP address of the beginning of the path, and "Dst" 
   denotes the IP address of the end.  
    
   The section 3 of the RMON PI Reference specifies the Protocol 
   Identifier Encoding rules, which consists briefly in a recursive 
   length value format. "Src" and "Dst" are protocol identifier 
   parameters. Their values are encoded in separated fields using the

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              February 2004 
                                      
                                      
   encoding rules of the protocol identifier, but without trailing 
   parameters. 
    
   The packet encapsulation defined in an instance of PacketType embeds 
   the format of "Src" and "Dst" and their values. The type and value of 
   these addresses depend on the type P of the packet, IP version 4, 
   IPV6, IP in IP... Both participate in the completion of the packet 
   encoding. 
    
   Examples: 
    
   RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers ip and ipip4. Should there 
   be an Internet tunnel end-point of the IP address 192.168.1.1 in the 
   tunnel 128.2.6.7. the PacketType of the source address of the tunnel, 
   Src, is 'ip.ipip4'. The encoding of 'ip.ipip4' using the RFC2895 
   rules adds a trailer 2.0.0. It means that an instance of this 
   protocol identifier has 2 parameters, which values will be set only 
   when implemented. In the IPPM PacketType context these 2 parameters 
   are provided in Src (or Dst). In the current example the value of Src 
   is "192.168.1.1 128.2.6.7". 
    
4.1.5   GMTTimeStamp 
    
   This textual convention defines the time at which an event occurred. 
   It is very similar to the NTP timestamp format except that it 
   represents the time elapsed since January 1st, 2000 instead of 
   January 1st, 1900. 
    
 
4.1.6   IppmStandardMetrics 
    
   Each standard metric is identified in the IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY under 
   the node rfc in chronological order. This textual convention defines 
   an octet string to permit several metrics to be performed in a single 
   measure.  
    
4.1.7   Report definition 
    
   A report consists of sending, or logging, a subset of results of 
   measurements that have been taken over a period of time. The report 
   defines actions that are taken on the measurement results. An action 
   is performed either: 
    
   + For each result 
   + On the results corresponding to a measurement cycle 
   + On the results available at the measurement completion.  
    
   To preserve the scalability of the whole measurement system, it 
   limits: 
    
   + The amount of data sent to the applications

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              February 2004 
                                      
                                      
   + The bandwidth consumption for uploading the result 
   + The number of alarms sent to the applications 
   + The amount of data saved in the point of measure 
         
    
   Metric thresholds (low, high, inband, outband...) may be defined that 
   indicate when measure values should be reported. These values and 
   their associated time may directly impact service availability. 
    
   One may also want to report when particular values (i.e. constantly 
   over a threshold) repeatedly occur over a period of time. For 
   example, if one-way-day is constantly over a specified acceptable 
   threshold value for 10 minutes, then the values should be reported.  
    
    
   The combination of IPPM metric results, threshold events, and event 
   filtering provides a very efficient mechanism to report measurement 
   results, events, and alarms. 
    
   A report is described using the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION 
   IppmMetricResultFilter. The report setup must not dramatically 
   increase the amount of data needed by the control protocol to setup a 
   measure: 
    
   +  A basic report is defined in the object ippmAggrMeasureFilter; 
   +  More elaborate reports are described using a metric threshold to 
   generate alarms and events.  
   +  The generation of alarms and reports requires a management station 
   address to which the data will be sent. 
   +  SLA alarms are described using an events duration threshold. 
    
   The TEXTUAL-CONVENTION IppmMetricResultFilter specifies the list of 
   events and actions that are used to create a report. 
    
 
4.2     Structure of the MIB 
 
   The MIB is arranged as follow: 
    
   - ippmSystem Group:  
    
    +   ippmPointOfMeasureTable; 
    +   ippmSynchronizationTable; 
   +   ippmMetricsTable. 
    
   - ippmOwners Group:  
   -  
    +   ippmOwnersTable; 
    
   - ippmHistory Group: 
   -

    +   ippmHistoryTable; 
    
   - ippmNetMeasure Group: 
   -  
    +   ippmNetMeasureTable; 
    
   - ippmAggrMeasure Group: 
   -  
   +   ippmAggrMeasureTable. 
    
   - ippmNotifications   
         
         
4.2.1   The ippmSystem Group 
    
   The implementation of this group is mandatory. 
    
   This group consists of a set of parameters describing the clock 
   synchronization at a particular point of measure over time, as well 
   as the system clock of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent. 
    
   The table ippmPointOfMeasureTable describes the points of measure. 
    
   The table ippmSynchronisationTable is critical to the implementation, 
   especially to be respectful of the Section 6.3. of the IPPM 
   Framework, which states that 
   "Those who develop such measurement methodologies should strive to: 
     +    Minimize their uncertainties/errors, 
     +    Understand and document the sources of uncertainty/error, and 
     +    Quantify the amounts of uncertainty/error." 
    
   Consequently the table ippmSynchronisationTable makes these values 
   available to compute reliable statistics.  
 
   The table ippmMetricsTable list all the IPPM metrics using the 
   registry order and describes their implementation (unit...). 
    
4.2.2   The ippmOwners Group  
    
   This group identifies an owner, or group of owners, that have access 
   to measurements on a probe. 
    
4.2.3   The ippmHistory Group 
    
   The results of any given measure are stored in the ippmHistoryTable. 
   The indexing is such that there is an entry in this table for each 
   result of a given measure for a given metric. 
    
4.2.4   The ippmNetMeasure Group

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              February 2004 
                                      
                                      
   The control protocol registers a description of the existing network 
   measures in the ippmNetMeasureTable. 
    
   This group displays the network measures defined by the control 
   protocol. The results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable.  
    
   ippmNetMeasureTable is a reflection of the configuration of the 
   network measure. 
    
4.2.5   The ippmAggrMeasure Group  
    
   ippmAggrMeasureTable is responsible for the aggregation of results. 
   The aggregated results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable and may be 
   used for higher aggregated measures. 
    
4.2.6   The Notification Group  
    
   The Notification group specifies a list of valid notifications. They 
   are used to generate alarms, or reports, to management applications. 
    
4.3     Row identification in an application namespace 
    
   IPPM metrics measurement is a distributed task. An owner namespace is 
   defined to avoid the need of polling to determine the next free 
   index, to avoid index collision when 2 applications are looking for a 
   new index as the same time; to increase the speed of the management 
   operations; to reduce bandwidth consumption and to reduce CPU load in 
   the agents and applications. 
    
    
   In a MIB, an object instance identifier is defined by the clause 
   INDEX of the table as a list of objects.  
    
   The owner namespace is defined in the INDEX as a couple of 2 objects 
   where the type of first one is IppmOwnerString and the type of the 
   second is IppmOwnerIndex. 
    
   The first term of the instance identifier is the name of the owner. 
   The second term is an private index managed by the owner. This index 
   value is unique in an owner namespace. Before the creation of an 
   instance the creator pick up an IppmOwnerIndex value not in use. 
    
    
   This allows the user to choose arbitrary values for the remaining 
   fields of the INDEX clause without checking that the values of these 
   fields exists in the MIB tables. Moreover this allows the owner to 
   use the same instance identifier over a set of IPPM MIB 
   implementations. 
 
   Measurements are requested by management applications. An instance of 
   an object managed by a management station is identified by the

4.4     Relationship of IPPM REPORTING MIB tables 
   There is inherently a relationship between various tables in the IPPM 
   REPORTING MIB, and as such, the data integrity must be assured. This 
   relationship is depicted in the following examples. 
    
4.4.1   Relationship between the Owners Table and the aggregated 
         measure table 
    
   The owners table contains the list of "owners" that can create and 
   activate remotely aggregated measures in an IPPM agent, or read the 
   existing network measures. 
    
   It is recommended to make use of "view based access control" in order 
   to restrict access to this table. For example, the master user 
   "administrator" may be given "write" privileges on the 
   ippmOwnersTable, whereas all others are restricted to "read" access.  
   The user "administrator" can then setup the list of other users that 
   have access to measures.  
    
   There must be at least 1 owner in the owners' table. This owner may 
   be either setup by default by the IPPM agent, or configured as stated 
   above. 
    
   An owner may have multiple corresponding entries in the network and 
   aggregated measure tables. Each entry in a measure table is 
   associated with one, and only one, entry in the owners' table. That 
   is to say, that a defined measure may NOT have multiple owners. 
 
   Thus, we have a 1:N relationship between the owners' table and a 
   measure table. 
    
 
4.4.2   Relationship between the Network Measure Table and the 
         Aggregated Measure Table 
    
   The network measure table is read-only, thus entries in this table 
   must be populated by the agent upon startup. 
   The agent could potentially read a database that contains network 
   measures configured by a 3rd party proprietary management system that 
   directly interacts with the points of measure. However, the "owner" 
   of the measure must be defined in the owners table. It may be either 
   configured directly, or exported to the agent by the external 
   measurement tool.  
    
   The aggregated measure table allows for an "owner" to create 
   aggregated measures (such as average, minimum, maximum...) on 
   existing measures. An owner may even create aggregated measures on 
   network measures that are owned by other owners. However, it is

   recommended to use view based access control to grant access of 
   network measures to other owners in the system. 
 
5       Measurement architectures 
    
   There are three main measurement architectures. 
 
5.1     Proxy architecture

   .                  SNMP or Sibling

   .             +--------------------------+ 
   .             | IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent | 
   .             +--------------------------+ 
   .                      ^     ^ 
   .                      |     | 
   .                    OWDP-Control 
   .                      |     | 
   .           +----------+     +----------+ 
   .           |                           | 
   .           v                           v 
   .+----------------+              +------------------+ 
   .| Packets-Sender |--OWDP-Test-->| Packets-Receiver | 
   .+----------------+              +------------------+ 
    
   In this architecture, the different NMSÆs query the IPPM-REPORTING-
   MIB agent for measurements. The agent controls whether the NMS is 
   granted access to perform the measure requested. Each NMS may access 
   the results of its measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB history 
   table. 
    
   The measurement setup/teardown and the data collection are done using 
   the control protocol and the test protocol. 
 
   In this mode the NMS does not depend on the control protocol nor on 
   the test protocol. The entities involved in the measurement do not 
   need to implement the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB nor SNMP. This mode allows 
   for lightweight implementation in the point of measure, and also for 
   heterogeneous control protocols to coexist. 
    
   Finally, the proxy is a checkpoint where measurement activity may be 
   logged, and where access to measurement setups may be tightly

   security of a measurement system. 
    
 
5.2     Reporting architecture 
    
   In this architecture the SNMP protocol is only used to read the 
   results of the measurements in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History Table, 
   and also to inform the NMS that an event has occurred.

   The activation of a measure by the control protocol or the test 
   protocol creates a measure in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB Network Measure 
   table. The table in question may be not accessible by SNMP. In this 
   case, a list of the measure identifiers (owner, index) is handled by 
   the measurement software. 
    
   Each timestamped result of the measure is logged in the IPPM-
   REPORTING-MIB History table in order to allow read access to the 
   NMSÆs and event handling. 
    
   On completion, the measurement results are managed according to the 
   measure setup: 
       + The results may be sent to an NMS;

       + They may be dropped from the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB History table. 
    
   In this mode, it is recommended to use an SNMPv2 Inform PDU to send 
   reporting events because it ensures that the entire block of the 
   result is received. There is no control using SNMP Trap PDU.

   The NMS measurement queries are registered in the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB 
   gateway and performed by the control and the test protocol. The NMS 
   directly consults the result in the corresponding IPPM REPORTING MIB 
   agent of the points of measure. 
 
5.4     Security 
 
   The proxy mode provides flexibility and control of the access to the 
   points of measure, while allowing lightweight control protocol and 
   test protocol implementations in the points of measure. Different 
   security rules may be applied to the NMS domain and to measurement 
   system domains.

Internet Draft             IPPM reporting MIB              February 2004 
                                      
                                      
    
   The reporting mode has 2 security domains: 
    
       +  The control of the measurement setup relies on the control and 
       the test protocol security mechanisms; 
       +  The control of access to the results depends on the SNMP 
       security mechanisms such as community strings, but may also be 
       restricted using VACM for customized access. 
    
   The gateway mode security relies on the security of the proxy mode 
   and of the reporting mode. 
    
6       Reporting mode integration 
    
   The IPPM-REPORTING-MIB standardizes the parameters that: 
    
       + Define the configuration of the IPPM metric measures; 
       + Define the format of the results of the measure; 
       + Define the report of the IPPM metric measure results. 
    
   It introduces the concept of owner namespace to allow for fast 
   configuration and reporting across multiple points of measurement.  
    
   A measure is a distributed object describing a task to be performed 
   by the control and the test protocols. A measure is identified by its 
   owner and its owner index. This identifier is the same in all the 
   points of measure. As the owner chooses the index, there is no need 
   for negotiation between the NMS and the points of measure before 
   activating the measure. 
    
   A measure is primarily defined by its identifier, the metrics to 
   measure, the description of the end point addresses and the 
   description of the scheduling of the measure. 
    
   The description of the measure is distributed to the points of 
   measure involved. The distribution may not be synchronized. 
 
6.1     Integration  
 
   The integration of the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB, and the test and control 
   protocols consists in pushing the network measure setup/teardown 
   parameters and the result values from the measurement software to the 
   IPPM-REPORTING-MIB agent. 
 
6.2     Setup of the network measure table 
    
The measurement system updates the MIB on creation of a network measure.  
 
6.3     Setup of the aggregated measure table 
    
There are 2 ways to setup an aggregated measure:

    The measurement system updates the MIB on creation of an aggregated 
    measure; 
    An SNMP application creates an aggregated measure.  
 
6.4     Updating the history of the MIB  
 
   Results have to be written by the measurement task in the agent 
   implementing the IPPM REPORTING MIB.  
    
   Adding the results of a measurement consists in the transfer of the 
   result from the measurement software to the SNMP agent. The protocol 
   that provides the result may be the control protocol, or the test 
   protocol, or another mechanism.  
 
6.5     Default value 
    
   The default values correspond to IP version 4.

       This textual convention defines an octet string that gathers in a 
       bit string a sequence of bits. The bit order corresponds to the 
       order of the metric identifiers in the registry.  
       The first bit of the string has the index 0. The index 1 
       corresponds to the first metric of the registry 
       (instantaneousUnidirectionalConnectivity ).  
        
       Example:  
       One-way-Delay(6) is identified as the leaf number 6 of the node 
       rfc of the registry. One-way-Packet-Loss(12) is identified as the 
       leaf number 12 of the node  
       rfc of the registry. A network measure performing both One-way-
       Delay(6) and One-way-Packet-Loss(12) will be described as 
       '0001000001000000'b, '1040'B.

   DESCRIPTION 
       "IppmMetricsRegistryIndex defines an unambiguous index for each

       value is the value of the node of the metric in the IPPM 
       registry. This value is the same in any implementation of the 
       IPPM REPORTING MIB. 
        
       Example: 
       In the IPPM-METRICS-REGISTRY, onewayPacketLossAverage is 
       registered as the node 14 of ippmMetricsRegistry.metrics.rfc. 
       Consequently the index of the metric onewayPacketLossAverage in 
       the IppmMetricsTable will always be '14'. At large an instance, 
       which type is IppmMetricsRegistryIndex and which value is '14',

   STATUS       current 
   DESCRIPTION 
       "This textual convention is a display string used to describe the 
       protocol encapsulation list of a packet, and is used as the value 
       of the SYNTAX clause for the type of the Src and Dst of an IPPM 
       measure. The RFC2895 specifies a macro named PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER 
       for the definition of protocol identifiers, while its companion 
       document, the RFC2896 defines a set of protocol identifiers. 
        
       PacketType is defined as a display string. It consists of a list 
       of dot separated protocol names. Each protocol name has been 
       previously defined using the macro PROTOCOL-IDENTIFIER of the RFC 
       2895. 
        
       Examples: 
       The RFC2896 defines the protocol identifiers 'ether2', 'ip', 
       'ipip4', 'udp', 'tcp', 'telnet'... 
        
       The PacketType of the source address corresponding to telnet is 
       the string 'ip.tcp.telnet'. 
        
       The PacketType of the source address corresponding to UDP packets 
       sent in an IP tunnel is the string 'ip.ipip4.udp'. 
        
       Note:  
       An IPPM measure is active, so generally a PacketType value does 
       not describe the link layer (i.e. ether2...). Valid Internet 
       packets are sent from Src to Dst. Then the choice of the link 
       layer relies on the Internet stack."

   DESCRIPTION 
   "    Given that not all results from a metric measurement are

           The value is stored if it is lower than the high threshold of

           threshold of of the aggregated measure setup. 
        
       LogOutBandValue: 
           The value is stored if it is greater than the high threshold 
           of the aggregated measure setup or lower than the low 
           threshold of the aggregated measure setup. 
        
       LogAboveValue: 
           The value is stored if it is greater than the high threshold 
           of the aggregated measure setup. 
        
       LogBelowValue: 
           The value is stored if it is lower than the low metric 
           threshold field of the aggregated measure setup. 
                 
       logUpAndDownValue: 
           This filter stores contiguous results that are on opposite 
           sides of the up and down metric thresholds: 
                A result is stored if it is the first result aggregated: 
           If it is greater than the high threshold and lower than the 
           low threshold then its value is set to the value of the low 
           threshold; 
                 
                A result greater than the high threshold is stored if the

   DESCRIPTION 
       "ippmNetMeasureMetrics defines the metrics to compute within this 
       measure. Only network metrics of the same type are allowed in 
       this field (e.g. poisson-based metrics and periodic-based metrics 
       are incompatibles, while one-way delay and packet loss are 
       generally processed simultaneously: a very bad delay is 
       potentially a very good packet loss). 
        
       Results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable. Results of a metric 
       are identified using an index of type IppmMetricsRegistryIndex. 
        
       Example: 
       Given a multi-metrics measure of One-way-Delay(6) and One-way-
       Packet-Loss(12). The value of the field ippmNetMeasureMetrics is 
       '0001000001000000'b, '1040'B. Results are logged in the 
       ippmHistoryTable where One-way-Delay singletons have a value of 
       ippmMetricsIndex of 6 while One-way-Packet-Loss singletons have a 
       value of ippmMetricsIndex of 12.

       are generally processed simultaneously on the same network 
       measure). 
        
       Results are saved in the ippmHistoryTable. Results of a metric 
       are identified using an index of type IppmMetricsRegistryIndex. 
        
       Example: 
       Given a multi-aggregation of One-way-Delay-Median(9) and One-way-
       Delay-Minimum(10). The value of the field ippmAggrMeasureMetrics 
       is '0000011000000000'b, '0600'B. Results are logged in the 
       ippmHistoryTable where One-way-Delay-Median singletons have a 
       value of ippmMetricsIndex of 9 while One-way-Delay-Minimum 
       singletons have a value of ippmMetricsIndex of 10. 
        
       NOTE WELL: It is not recommended to use the multi aggregation 
       capability in conjunction with the filter feature.

       ippmAggrMeasureFilter defines the kind of filter to apply on a

       parameters of the filter are ippmAggrMeasureLowThreshold and 
       ippmAggrMeasureHighThreshold. 
        
       Thresholds have the same unit as the metric value. 
        
       In the following examples we consider an aggregated measure. Its 
       low threshold is set to 80.its high threshold is set to 100. The 
       aggregation produced a flow of 12 aggregated results {40 30 60 85 
       140 130 190 95 50 90 30 20}. 
        
       If the filter is set to 'logInBandValue' then the results 85, 95, 
       90 will be stored. 
        
       If the filter is set to 'logOutBandValue' then the results 40 30 
       60 140 130 190 50 30 20 will be stored. 
        
       If the filter is set to 'logAboveValue' then the results 140 130 
       190 will be stored. 
        
       If the filter is set to 'logBelowValue' then the results 40 30 60 
       50 30 20 will be stored. 
        
       If the filter is set to 'logUpAndDownValue' then the results 40,

8       Security Considerations 
    
8.1     VACM Access control 
    
   View Based Access Control, or VACM may be used to restrict access to 
   certain objects, or even object instances within tables. For example, 
   one may: 
    
   + Give an 'administrator' write access to the ippmOwnersTable, 
   whereas all other users may only have read access 
   + Give access to individual rows in the network measure, aggregated 
   measure, history, and report table to particular owners based upon 
   indexing on an 'owners name', and even upon a particular measure. 
   This will be illustrated below. 
   + Give access of one ownerÆs measure, and associated results, to 
   another owner in order to create an aggregated measure based upon the 
   results.  
    
8.1.1   Example of implementing VACM control for the IPPM-REPORTING-MIB 
    
   The following example illustrates how one could use VACM to restrict 
   access to particular objects within the MIB. It uses syntax specific 
   to a particular agent development toolkit, but may be generalized 
   using the concepts as defined in the VACM MIB. 
    
   In this example, we have two NMS users, namely user1=owner1 and 
   user2=owner2: 
   1) First we define the two users and their host addresses: 
   com2sec              owner1  owner1computer@ private 
   com2sec              owner2  owner2computer@ private 
    
   2) We then define SNMPv2c groups 
   group                        owner1  v2c     owner1 
   group                        owner2  v2c     owner2 
   view notif           included        ippmNotifications       ff 
    
   3.1) For the user owner1, we now define the views for which he will 
   have read access 
   # covers PointOfMeasureTable SynchronizationTable and all scalars 
   view owner1read      included        ippmSystem              ff

   3.5) Now we give the two users access to the views defined above. 
   Note that owner1 and owner2 have read access to owner1read and 
   owner2read views respectively. They have write access to owner1write 
   and owner2write view respectively. And they both have access to all 
   the notifications.  
    
   access       owner1  ""      any     noauth  exact   owner1read 
        owner1write     notif 
   access       owner2  ""      any     noauth  exact   owner2read 
        owner2write     notif 
    
    
8.2     Privacy 
    
   The privacy concerns of network measurement are intrinsically limited 
   by the active measurements. Unlike passive measurements, there can be 
   no release of existing user data. 
    
    
8.3     Measurement aspects 
    
   Conducting Internet measurements raises both security and privacy 
   concerns. This memo does not specify an implementation of the 
   metrics, so it does not directly affect the security of the Internet 
   nor of applications that run on the Internet. However, 
   implementations of these metrics must be mindful of security and 
   privacy concerns. 
     
    There are two types of security concerns: potential harm caused by 
   the measurements, and potential harm to the measurements. The 
   measurements could cause harm because they are active, and inject 
   packets into the network. The measurement parameters MUST be 
   carefully selected so that the measurements inject trivial amounts of 
   additional traffic into the networks they measure. If they inject 
   "too much" traffic, they can skew the results of the measurement, and 
   in extreme cases cause congestion and denial of service.

    The measurements themselves could be harmed by routers giving 
   measurement traffic a different priority than "normal" traffic, or by 
   an attacker injecting artificial measurement traffic. If routers can 
   recognize measurement traffic and treat it separately, the 
   measurements will not reflect actual user traffic. If an attacker 
   injects artificial traffic that is accepted as legitimate, the loss 
   rate will be artificially lowered. Therefore, the measurement 
   methodologies SHOULD include appropriate techniques to reduce the 
   probability measurement traffic can be distinguished from "normal" 
   traffic.  
    
   Authentication techniques, such as digital signatures, may be used 
   where appropriate to guard against injected traffic attacks. 
     
 
8.4     Management aspects 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-only. Such objects 
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
 
    SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.  
     
    It is recommended that the implementors consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use 
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [18] and the View-based 
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [21] is recommended.  
     
    It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.

   + Counter/index wrapping: 
   the index of the table wrap independently of the sequence of the 
   results. That makes it very difficult for application to track the 
   results. As the sequence id identify the instance of the result of a 
   measure the index is removed both from the table and from the index 
   clause.
