1.  Introduction

   This document captures the use cases that have been proposed so far
   within the DRINKS requirements design team.  The goal is to seek
   working group feedback to identify a set of in-scope use cases.  The
   end result of the use cases is to identify the data model and
   requirements for provisioning and managing session establishment
   data.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This document also reuses the SIP terminology defined in [RFC3261].
   The Lookup Function (LUF), Location Routing Functions (LRF) and other
   session peering terms are defined [I-D.ietf-speermint-terminology].
   In addition, this document specifies the following additional terms.


   Destination Group:   a set of global telephone numbers, dial codes or
      public identities that can be associated with a given Destination.
      A Destination Group logically groups data elements that share a
      common Destination together.



   Public Identity:  a generic term that refers to a telephone
      number(TN), a range of TNs, an email address, or other identity as
      deemed appropriate.  A public identity is represented as a
      globally routable URIs of a user address (e.g.,
      mailto:john.doe@example.net, sip:paul.speermint@example.com).



   Routing Group:  a logical grouping of routes.  A Destination Group
      may be associated with one or more routing groups based on its
      association with the data recipient group.



   Data Recipient Group:  a list of SIP Service Providers (SSPs) that
      have access to the associated Destination Group data.

3.  Use Cases

   This Section contains the use cases presented so far.  The use cases
   are logically grouped into functional areas: provisioning a registry,
   provisioning an ENUM server, LRF & LUF, and SIP Service Provider
   (SSP).  Use cases that are are not presently grouped are specified in
   Section 3.5.

3.1.  Provisioning a Registry

   This Section targets use cases concerned with the provisioning of
   session establishment data in the registry.  Provisioning can be
   accomplished in (near) real time through an automated interface
   (e.g., from a service provisioning system) or by specifying an
   effective date and time.  When an effective date/time is used, the
   registry validates the format and enters it into the registry
   database with the effective date & time.

   The following use cases are considered:

   1.  Provisioning destination groups and associated routing
       information.

   2.  Provisioning data recipient groups.

   3.  Provisioning a public identity or range of TNs: A globally
       routable TN or another type of public identity is provisioned and
       assigned to a Destination Group.  No effective date is provided
       as it is desired to be made effective in (near) real time meaning
       as soon as validations (format) are complete, the data is entered
       into the Registry database.  A distribution function may pick up
       the provisioned instance in real-time or in batch mode to
       distribute to each address server.  Note that it is assumed that
       the routing information for the Destination Group has already
       been defined.  This is another Use Case.

   4.  Public Identity is taken out of service: A public identity
       (including a TN, or a TN range) is taken out of service because
       it is no longer valid.  The Registry receives a delete operation
       and removes the public identity from its database.  This may also
       trigger a number of delete updates during the distribution
       operations to appropriate deletes to each address server.

   5.  Assigning a set of TNs to a different Destination Group changing
       their routing: A set of public identities (e.g., set of TNs) are
       assigned a different Destination Group which effectively changes
       their routing information.  This may be due to a network re-
       arrangement, a Signaling path Border Element being split into



Channabasappa, Ed. & Dolly, Ed.  Expires April 30, 2009         [Page 5]

Internet-Draft     channabasappa-drinks-usecases-reqs       October 2008


       two, or a need to do maintenance, two carriers merging, or other
       considerations.  This scenario can also include an effective date
       and time.

   6.  Moving an SSP from one Data Recipient Group to another: An SSP
       would like to re-assign the Destination Groups it shares with a
       peer and move the peer SSP from one Data Recipient Group to
       another.  This action effectively changes the routing for all
       public identities and associated services to the routing
       information associated with the new Data Recipient Group and
       Destination Group.

   7.  Defining a Routing Group: A Routing Group is a set of routes that
       may include routes for a number of different public identities,
       e.g., TNs, IM identifier, email.  A Destination Group may be
       associated with 1 or more Routing Groups based on its association
       with the Data Recipient Group.

3.2.  Provisioning an ENUM Server

   This Section targets use cases concerned with the provisioning of
   session establishment data in the ENUM Server.  The following use
   cases have been proposed:

   1.  Provisioning a Public Identify or set of Public Identities at an
       effective date/time.

   2.  A Public Identify is taken out of service at an effective date/
       time.

   3.  Assigning a set of Public Identities to a different destination
       group, thereby changing their routing.

3.3.  LRF and LUF

   This Section contains use cases related to LRF and LUF.  They are
   presented in the following sub-sections.

3.3.1.  LRF

   1.   Source service provider direct connection (bi-lateral): A
        service provider may be connected directly with a peer network
        hosting the ultimate SIP destination.  Thesource service
        provider is able to translate to obtain the ultimate destination
        through LUF.

   2.   Source service provider direct connection (bi-lateral): A
        service provider may be connected directly with a peer network



Channabasappa, Ed. & Dolly, Ed.  Expires April 30, 2009         [Page 6]

Internet-Draft     channabasappa-drinks-usecases-reqs       October 2008


        hosting the SIP destination.  The source service provider is not
        able to translate to the ultimate destination because the LUF
        does not contain a translation.

   3.   Source service provider direct connection (bi-lateral): A
        service provider may be connected directly with a peer network
        not hosting the SIP destination.  The Source service provider is
        not able to translate to the ultimate destination because the
        LUF does not contain a translation.  The selected target network
        is able to perform the LUF to identify the ultimate destination.

   4.   Source service provider is not connected directly with a peer
        network hosting the ultimate SIP destination rather through an
        intermediate transit network which is connected to a peer
        network hosting the ultimate SIP destination.  Note that
        variations in use cases 1, 2 & 3 all apply.

   5.   Source service provider is not connected directly with a peer
        network hosting the ultimate SIP destination, rather to a
        clearing house network which is connected to a peer network
        hosting the ultimate SIP destination.

   6.   Source service provider is not connected directly with a peer
        network hosting the ultimate SIP destination rather through more
        than one intermediate transit networks which are all connected
        to a peer network hosting the ultimate SIP destination.  The
        source service provider has to chose the transit service
        provider to select.

   7.   Source service provider has multiple paths to a destination
        network both on inter-network connections and inter-transit
        network connections.  The source service provider wants to
        select different transit networks and different routes to those
        networks based on various criteria such as traffic load,
        capacity, cost, latency, etc.

   8.   Roaming mobile user uses IMS service accessed through local
        breakout, the service is located outside the serving network.

   9.   Roaming mobile user is disconnected from emergency service call
        (via IMS local breakout).  The PSAP is located in a network
        outside of the serving network.  The PSAP initiates a callback
        to the mobile which should go to the serving network, not the
        home network from the network the PSAP is located in.

   10.  A transit network connected to the source service provider has
        had a route change or a network connectivity change which needs
        to be communicated to its peer networks.



Channabasappa, Ed. & Dolly, Ed.  Expires April 30, 2009         [Page 7]

Internet-Draft     channabasappa-drinks-usecases-reqs       October 2008


   11.  A transit network has a change in the domains it is able to
        reach (added, dropped/unavailable, route change) which it needs
        to send to its peer networks.

   12.  The transit network uses LRF to route internally to the network
        and to select one of several possible exit points, next hop
        transit network and specific connection between networks.

   13.  The service provider may have fixed domain routing specified in
        the LRF which overrides the domain routing provided by peer
        networks.

   14.  The service provider may have fixed routing specified in the LRF
        as a default until a peer network identifies it is able to
        provide alternate (better) routing.

3.3.2.  LUF

   A service provider's LUF is connected to several different Registries
   some for national numbers, some for enterprise identifiers (e.g.
   @example.com translating to @example.nt for an enterprise user who
   has a mobile with a public user identity or GRUU (3GPP TS 23.228)
   which is part of an enterprise domain. {What if there is a collision
   and conflict between some particular number or domain between
   registries?}

3.4.  SSP

   This Section contains SIP Service Provider specific use cases.  They
   are presented in the following sub-sections.

3.4.1.  Generic SSP

   An SSP provisions a registry to offer different routes to different
   interconnecting parties.  The SSP uses the same routes for an
   aggregation of public identities (e.g., TNs) and desires to be able
   to specify routing for the aggregate.  Routes consist of a set of RRs
   of any legitimate type.

3.4.2.  Small SSP

   The small SSP provides coverage to a small city only with 3 different
   peer interconnects: 1) To another small SSP covering an adjacent
   small city; 2) to a mid-sized SSP providing coverage to the remainder
   of the state; 3 to a large multi-national SSP providing SSP transit
   services for the remainder of the world.

Internet-Draft     channabasappa-drinks-usecases-reqs       October 2008


3.4.2.1.  Configuring small SSP routing

   The small SSP with a small number of SSP peer arrangements prefers to
   statically define and provision the SED routing through network
   engineering tools by the network engineering staff.  This is because
   the domain coverage of each peer SSP will not change very frequently
   and the small SSP does not want to incur the cost and complexity of a
   dynamically established routing data.

3.4.2.2.  Small SSP LUF/LRF consolidation

   A small SSP only needs a single network element to handle its entire
   LUF/LRF needs and as such combines the LUF and LRF.  The routing
   associations in this network element are provisioned statically
   through network management tools by network operation or engineering
   staff.

3.4.3.  Large SSP

   The large SSP provides coverage to a large country: the SSP is
   administratively divided into regions.  The SSP provides SSP transit
   services to smaller SSPs operating in the same areas.  The SSP has
   both direct SSP connections for national and international service
   and indirect SSP connections for international service to some
   countries based on traffic levels.  This results in multiple possible
   routes to some destination SSPs through different intermediate SSPs.
   Each SSP region has a different sub-set of peer SSPs that it is
   directly connected to (e.g.  Some regions may have to route
   internally to another SSP region to reach the destination SSP).

3.4.3.1.  Configuring large SSP routing

   The large SSP has a large number of direct and indirect peer
   arrangements along with multiple possible routes to the same
   destination SSP.  The large SSP prefers to only provision the SSP
   peers and have the elements such as SBCs learn the routes based on
   peer SSP advertisements to eliminate routing errors (loops, dead
   ends, etc.) which are service affecting and almost impossible to
   troubleshoot in a network of this size.

3.4.3.2.  Large SSP LUF/LRF separation and LRF distribution

   A large SSP needs to centralize its LUF but split off the LRF for
   deployment in decentralized regional network elements.  The routing
   associations in the regional LRFs are provisioned dynamically through
   advertisements by the large SSP peering SSPs regarding which domains
   they are able to handle.

Internet-Draft     channabasappa-drinks-usecases-reqs       October 2008


3.4.3.3.  Large SSP peering with a small SSP

   A large SSP peers with a small SSP.  The small SSP is unable to
   support the cost and complexity of dynamically advertising to its
   peer SSPs the domains it is able to reach directly or indirectly.
   The large SSP provisions routing association data statically
   representing the domains which the small SSP can reach either
   directly or indirectly, through network management tools by network
   operation or engineering staff.

3.5.  Miscellaneous Use Cases

   This Section contains all the use cases that were not categorized as
   belonging to the specific groups indicated above.  Based on further
   discussions these may be re-classified.

3.5.1.  Separation of Responsibility

   An SSP's business practices are such that; (i) network engineering
   and planning personnel are responsible for provisioning the points of
   interconnect (e.g. hosts and IP addressing information), and (ii)
   back office systems are responsible for number management
   provisioning of TNs.  An example flow would be: a network engineer
   establishes physical interconnect with a peering SSP's network and
   provisions associated domain name, host, and IP addressing
   information, which is provisioned to the registry/ENUMserver.
   Separately, for each new service subscription, the SSP's back office
   system provisions the associated TNs or other public identities.

3.5.2.  Intra-Network vs Inter-Network

   SSP wishes to provision their intra-network Session Establishment
   Data (SED) such that it enables current and future network services
   to identify and route real-time sessions.  For example, in the case
   of VoIP calls it allows one CMS (calling) to discover another
   (called).  The SSP provisions IP addressing information of each CMS,
   which is provisioned to the registry/ENUMserver but only distributed
   to their own local ENUM server.  This SED may differ from the SED
   that is distributed to other local ENUM servers.

3.5.3.  Massive Sunrise Provisioning

   Based on configurable thresholds, sunrise may imply a batch
   asynchronous provisioning process.  For instance, an SSP has
   commissioned a new ENUM server and wishes to download a very large
   number of telephone numbers.  Rather than stream individual TNs in
   real-time, one at a time, towards the ENUM server the SSP's back-
   office system prefers to perform the operation as a set of one or



Channabasappa, Ed. & Dolly, Ed.  Expires April 30, 2009        [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     channabasappa-drinks-usecases-reqs       October 2008


   more batches.  The SSP has just commissioned a new ENUM server which
   they plan to employ as a centralized routing server.  The network
   engineering group has provisioned, upon their ENUM server, the IP
   addressing information of all CMS which constitute the SSP's
   topology.  During a regularly scheduled maintenance window the SSP
   would like to download from its back office system the TNs associated
   with each CMS.

3.5.4.  Real-Time Provisioning

   Post-sunrise, an SSP wishes to have their back-office systems add or
   remove TNs per normal business operations.  Over the course of a day
   there is churn in the SSP's subscriber base and as such they would
   like the ability to stream, in real-time, additions, modifications
   and deletions.

3.5.5.  Establishing Destination Groups

   An SSP wishes to control the flow of traffic into their network
   (ingress) based on groupings of Public Identities, called Destination
   Groups.  Associating each group of Public Identities with a specific
   set of ingress SBEs or points-of-interconnect.  The SSP, for example,
   sub-divides the country into four regions: North-East, South-East,
   Mid-West, and West-Coast.  For each region they establish points-of-
   interconnect with peers and provision the associated SED hostnames or
   IP addresses of the SBEs used for ingress traffic.  Against each
   region they provision the served Public Identities in to the
   Destination Groups and associate those destination groups with the
   appropriate points of ingres.  The destination groups and points of
   ingress are provisioned to the Registyr/Enumserver.  Need to separate
   this use case into two.

3.5.6.  Direct and Selective Peering

   In this case the SSP is the actual carrier-of-record; the entity
   serving the end user.  And the SSP wishes to communicate different
   SED data to some of its peers that wish to route to its destinations.
   So the SSP has implemented direct points-of-interconnect with each
   peer and therefore would like address-resolution to result in
   different answers depending on which peer is asking.

3.5.7.  Indirect Peering to Selected Destinations

   The SSP transit provider wishes to provide transit peering points for
   a set of destinations.  But that set of destinations does not align
   with the destination groups that already exist.  The SSP wishes to
   establish its own destination groups for the destinations that it
   provides transit to.

Internet-Draft     channabasappa-drinks-usecases-reqs       October 2008


3.5.8.  Fully Qualified TN Destinations

   The SSP wishes to add or remove one or multiple fully qualified TN
   destinations in a single provisioning request.

3.5.9.  TN Range Destinations

   The SSP wishes to add or remove one or multiple TN Range destinations
   in a single provisioning request.  TN Ranges support number ranges
   that need not be 'blocks'.  In other words the TN range start can be
   any number and the TN range end can be any number that is greater
   than the TN range start.

3.5.10.  RN Destinations

   The SSP does not wish to provision individual TNs, but instead, for
   ease of management, wishes to provision RNs.  Each RN effectively
   represents a set of individual TNs, and that set of TNs is assumed to
   change 'automatically' as TNs are ported in and ported out.

3.5.11.  Non-TN Destinations

   An SSP chooses to peer their messaging service with another SSPs
   picture/video mail service.  Allowing a user to send and receive
   pictures and/or video messages to a mobile user's handset, for
   example.  The important aspect of this use case is that it goes
   beyond simply mapping TNs to IP addresses/hostnames that describe
   points-of-interconnect between peering network SSP's.  Rather, for
   each user the SSP provisions the subscriber's email address (i.e.
   jane.doe@example.com).  This mapping allows the mobile multimedia
   messaging service center (MMSC) to use the subscriber email address
   as the lookup key and route messages accordingly.

3.5.12.  Peering Relationship Management

   An SSP wishes to have the peering relationship management process
   factilitated through automation.  An SSP can offer itself as a Peer
   to another SSP and that peer can accept or reject that peering
   relationship.

3.5.13.  Peering Grant/Acceptance

   An SSP wishes to facilitate the establishment of peering
   relationships and interconenct points with its peers.  It submits a
   grant to a potential peering partner for a point of interconnect.
   The Grantee can accept or ignore the grant.  The act of granting and
   accepting is facilitated by an automation process.

3.5.14.  Points of Egress

   An SSP has a peering relation ship with a peer.  And when sending
   messages to that peer's point of interconnection, the originating SSP
   wishes to egress through one or more points of egress.  These points
   of egree may vary for an given peer.

3.5.15.  Tier 2

   An SSP maintains a Tier 2 name server that contains the NAPTR records
   that constitute the terminal step in the LUF.  The SSP needs to
   provision an registry to direct queries for the SSPs numbers to the
   Tier 2.  Usually queries to the registry should return NS records,
   but, in cases where the Tier 2 uses a different domain suffix from
   that used in the registry, CNAME records may be employed instead.

3.5.16.  Non-blocking transactions

   An SSP is loading a large update in the registry (for example, a
   large amount of adds & delete operations due to a Destination Group
   being split into 2).  In the meantime, the SSP wants to change a
   route linked with another Destination Group because it has been
   misconfigured .

4.  Security Considerations

   Session establishment data allows for the routing of SIP sesions
   within, and between, SIP Service Providers.  Access to this data can
   compromise the routing of sessions and expose a SIP Service Provider
   to attacks such as service hijacking and denial of service.  The data
   can be compromised by vulnerable functional components and interfaces
   identified within the use cases.
