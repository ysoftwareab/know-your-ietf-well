1.  Introduction

   This document defines a base YANG [RFC6020] [RFC7950] model for
   Quality of Service (QoS) configuration parameters.  QoS base modules
   define the basic building blocks to define a classifier, policy,
   action and target.  The base models are augmented to include packet
   match fields and action parameters to define the Diffrentiated
   Services (DiffServ) module.  Queues and schedulers are stitched as
   part of diffserv policy model.  Separate models have been defined for

   creating Queue policy and Scheduling policy.  The DiffServ model is
   based on DiffServ architecture, and various references have been made
   to available standard architecture documents.

   DiffServ is a preferred approach for network service providers to
   offer services to different customers based on their network Quality-
   of-Service (QoS) objectives.  The traffic streams are differentiated
   based on DiffServ Code Points (DSCP) carried in the IP header of each
   packet.  The DSCP markings are applied by upstream node or by the
   edge router on entry to the DiffServ network.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].

   Tree diagrams used in this document follow the notation defined in
   [RFC8340]

   *  "XXXX" --> the assigned RFC value for this draft both in this
      draft and in the yang modules under the revision statement.

   *  The "revision" date in model, in the format XXXX-XX-XX, needs to
      be updated with the date the draft gets approved.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Definitions and Acronyms

   This document uses definitions and acronyms defined in Definitions of
   the Differentiated Services Field (DS Field) in the IPv4 and IPv6
   Headers [RFC2474], An Architecture for Differentiated Services

   *  DiffServ: Differentiated Services enhancements to the Internet
      protocol are intended to enable scalable service discrimination in
      the Internet without the need for per-flow state and signaling at
      every hop.  A variety of services may be built from a small, well-
      defined set of building blocks which are deployed in network
      nodes.

   *  DSCP: Differentiated Services Code Point

   *  Marking: the process of setting the DS codepoint in a packet based
      on defined rules; pre-marking, re-marking.

   *  Metering: the process of measuring the temporal properties (e.g.,
      rate) of a traffic stream selected by a classifier.  The
      instantaneous state of this process may be used to affect the
      operation of a marker, shaper, or dropper, and/or may be used for
      accounting and measurement purposes.

   *  Policing: the process of discarding packets (by a dropper) within
      a traffic stream in accordance with the state of a corresponding
      meter enforcing a traffic profile.

   *  RED: Random Early Detection

   *  Shaping: the process of delaying packets within a traffic stream
      to cause it to conform to some defined traffic profile.

   *  WRED: Weighted Random Early Detection

2.  QoS Model Design

   A classifier consists of packets which may be grouped when a logical
   set of rules are applied on different packet header fields.  The
   grouping may be based on different values or range of values of same
   packet header field, presence or absence of some values or range of
   values of a packet field or a combination thereof.  The QoS
   classifier is defined in the ietf-qos-classifier module.

   A classifier entry contains one or more packet conditioning
   functions.  A packet conditioning function is typically based on
   direction of traffic and may drop, mark or delay network packets.  A
   set of classifier entries with corresponding conditioning functions
   when arranged in order of priority represents a QoS policy.  A QoS
   policy may contain one or more classifier entries.  These are defined
   in ietf-qos-policy module.

Internet-Draft             YANG Models for QoS                March 2022


   Actions are configured in line with respect to the policy module.
   These include marking, dropping or shaping.  Actions are defined in
   the ietf-qos-action module.

   A meter qualifies if the traffic arrival rate is based on agreed upon
   rate and variability.  A meter is modeled based on commonly used
   alogrithms in industry, Single Rate Tri Color Marking (srTCM)
   [RFC2697] meter, Two Rate Tri Color Marking (trTCM) [RFC2698] meter,
   and Single Rate Two Color Marking meter.  Different vendors can
   extend it with other types of meters as well.

3.  DiffServ Model Design

   DiffServ architecture [RFC3289] and [RFC2475] describe the
   architecture as a simple model where traffic entering a network is
   classified and possibly conditioned at the boundary of the network
   and assigned a different Behavior Aggregate (BA).  Each BA is
   identified by a specific value of DSCP, and is used to select a Per
   Hop Behavior (PHB).

   The packet classification policy identifies the subset of traffic
   which may receive a DiffServ by being conditioned or mapped.  Packet
   classifiers select packets within a stream based on the content of
   some portion of the packet header.  There are two types of
   classifiers, the BA classifier, and the Multi-Field (MF) classifier
   which selects packets based on a value which is combination of one or
   more header fields.  In the ietf-diffserv module, this is realized by
   augmenting the QoS classification module.

   Traffic conditioning includes metering, shaping and/or marking.  A
   meter is used to measure the traffic against a given traffic profile.
   The traffic profile specifies the temporal property of the traffic.
   A packet that arrives is first determined to be in or out of the
   profile, which will result in the action of marked, dropped or
   shaped.  This is realized in vendor specific modules based on the
   parameters defined in action module.  The metering parameters are
   augmented to the QoS policy module when metering is defined inline,
   and to the metering template when metering profile is referred in
   policy module.

4.  Modules Tree Structure

   This document defines seven YANG modules - four QoS base modules, a
   scheduler policy module, a queuing policy module and one DiffServ
   module.

   ietf-qos-classifier consists of classifier entries identified by a
   classifier entry name.  Each entry MAY contain a list of filter
   entries.  When no filter entry is present in a classifier entry, it
   matches all traffic.

   module: ietf-qos-classifier
     +--rw classifiers {classifier-template-feature}?
        +--rw classifier* [name]
           +--rw name                string
           +--rw description?        string
           +--rw filter-operation?   identityref
           +--rw filter* [type logical-not]
                 ...

                 Figure 1: ietf-qos-classifier tree diagram

   An ietf-qos-policy module contains list of policy objects identified
   by a policy name and policy type which MUST be provided.  With
   different values of policy types, each vendor MAY define their own
   construct of policy for different QoS functionalities.  Each vendor
   MAY augment classifier entry in a policy definition with a set of
   actions.

   module: ietf-qos-policy
     +--rw policies
        +--rw policy* [name type]
           +--rw name           string
           +--rw type           identityref
           +--rw description?   string
           +--rw classifier* [name]
                 ...


                   Figure 2: ietf-qos-policy tree diagram

   ietf-qos-action module contains grouping of set of QoS actions.
   These include metering, marking, dropping and shaping.  Marking sets
   DiffServ codepoint value in the classified packet.  Color-aware and
   Color-blind meters are augmented by vendor specific modules based on
   the parameters defined in action module.

   module: ietf-qos-action
     +--rw meters
        +--rw meter* [name] {meter-template-support}?
           +--rw name                              string
           +--rw (meter-type)?
                 ...

                  Figure 3: ietf-qos-actions tree diagram

   ietf-qos-target module contains reference of qos-policy and augments
   ietf-interfaces [RFC8343] module.  A single policy of a particular
   policy-type can be applied on an interface in each direction of
   traffic.  Policy-type is of type identity and is populated in a
   vendor specific manner.  This way it provides greater flexibility for
   each vendor to define different policy types each with its own
   capabilities and restrictions.

   Classifier, metering and queuing counters are associated with a
   target.

   module: ietf-qos-target

     augment /if:interfaces/if:interface:
       +--rw qos-target-policy* [direction type]
          +--rw direction    identityref
          +--rw type         identityref
          +--rw name         string

                   Figure 4: ietf-qos-target tree diagram

   Diffserv module augments QoS classifier module.  Many of the YANG
   types defined in [RFC6991] are represented as leafs in the classifier
   module.

   Metering and marking actions are realized by augmenting the QoS
   policy-module.  Any queuing, AQM and scheduling actions are part of
   vendor specific augmentation.  Statistics are realized by augmenting
   the QoS target module.

   module: ietf-diffserv

Appendix A.  Company A, Company B and Company C examples

   Company A, Company B and Company C Diffserv modules augments all the
   filter types of the QoS classifier module as well as the QoS policy
   module that allow it to define marking, metering, min-rate, max-rate
   actions.  Queuing and metering counters are realized by augmenting of
   the QoS target module.

A.1.  Example of Company A Diffserv Model

   The following Company A vendor example augments the qos and diffserv
   model, demonstrating some of the following functionality:

   - use of template based classifier definitions

   - use of single policy type modelling queue, scheduler policy, and a
   filter policy.  All of these policies either augment the qos policy
   or the diffserv modules

   - use of inline actions in a policy

   - flexibility in marking dscp or metadata at ingress and/or egress.

        yang-version 1.1;
        namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:example-compa-diffserv";

A.2.  Example of Company B Diffserv Model

   The following vendor example augments the qos and diffserv model,
   demonstrating some of the following functionality:

   - use of inline classifier definitions (defined inline in the policy
   vs referencing an externally defined classifier)

   - use of mulitple policy types, e.g. a queue policy, a scheduler
   policy, and a filter policy.  All of these policies either augment
   the qos policy or the diffserv modules

   - use of a queue module, which uses and extends the queue grouping
   from the ietf-qos-action module

   - use of meter templates (v.s. meter inline)

   - use of internal meta data for classification and marking

A.3.  Example of Company C Diffserv Model

   Company C vendor augmentation is based on Ericsson's implementation
   differentiated QoS.  This implementation first sorts traffic based on
   a classifier, which can sort traffic into one or more traffic
   forwarding classes.  Then, a policer or meter policy references the
   classifier and its traffic forwarding classes to specify different
   service levels for each traffic forwarding class.

   Because each classifier sorts traffic into one or more traffic
   forwarding classes, this type of classifier does not align with ietf-
   qos-classifier.yang, which defines one traffic forwarding class per

   classifier.  Additionally, Company C's policing and metering policies
   relies on the classifier's pre-defined traffic forwarding classes to
   provide differentiated services, rather than redefining the patterns
   within a policing or metering policy, as is defined in ietf-
   diffserv.yang.

   Due to these differences, even though Company C uses all the building
   blocks of classifier and policy, Company C's augmentation does not
   use ietf-diffserv.yang to provide differentiated service levels.
   Instead, Company C's augmentation uses the basic building blocks,
   ietf-qos-policy.yang to provide differentiated services.
