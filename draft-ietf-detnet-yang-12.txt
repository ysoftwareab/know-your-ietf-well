1.  Introduction

   DetNet (Deterministic Networking) provides a capability to carry
   specified unicast or multicast data flows for real-time applications
   with extremely low packet loss rates and assured maximum end-to-end
   delivery latency.  A description of the general background and
   concepts of DetNet can be found in [RFC8655].

   This document defines a YANG model for DetNet based on YANG data
   types and modeling language defined in [RFC6991] and [RFC7950].
   DetNet service, which is designed for describing the characteristics
   of services being provided for application flows over a network, and
   DetNet configuration, which is designed for DetNet flow path
   establishment, flow status reporting, and DetNet functions
   configuration in order to achieve end-to-end bounded latency and zero
   congestion loss, are both included in this document.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC8655].

3.  DetNet YANG Module

   The DetNet YANG module includes DetNet App-flow, DetNet Service Sub-
   layer, and DetNet Forwarding Sub-layer configuration and operational
   objects.  The corresponding attributes used in different sub-layers
   are defined in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 respectively.

3.1.  DetNet Application Flow YANG Attributes

   DetNet application flow is responsible for mapping between
   application flows and DetNet flows at the edge node(egress/ingress
   node).  The application flows can be either layer 2 or layer 3 flows.
   To map a flow at the User Network Interface (UNI), the corresponding
   attributes are defined in [I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model].

3.2.  DetNet Service Sub-layer YANG Attributes

   DetNet service functions, e.g., DetNet tunnel initialization/
   termination and service protection, are provided in the DetNet
   service sub-layer.  To support these functions, the following service
   attributes need to be configured:

   *  DetNet flow identification





Geng, et al.            Expires 20 November 2021                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          draft-ietf-detnet-yang-12               May 2021


   *  Service function indication, indicates which service function will
      be invoked at a DetNet edge, relay node or end station.  (DetNet
      tunnel initialization or termination are default functions in
      DetNet service layer, so there is no need for explicit
      indication).  The corresponding arguments for service functions
      also needs to be defined.

3.3.  DetNet Forwarding Sub-layer YANG Attributes

   As defined in [RFC8655], DetNet forwarding sub-layer optionally
   provides congestion protection for DetNet flows over paths provided
   by the underlying network.  Explicit route is another mechanism that
   is used by DetNet to avoid temporary interruptions caused by the
   convergence of routing or bridging protocols, and it is also
   implemented at the DetNet forwarding sub-layer.

   To support congestion protection and explicit route, the following
   transport layer related attributes are necessary:

   *  Flow Specification and Traffic Requirements, refers to
      [I-D.ietf-detnet-flow-information-model].  These may used for
      resource reservation, flow shaping, filtering and policing by a
      control plane or other network management and control mechanisms.

   *  Since this model programs the data plane existing explicit route
      mechanisms can be reused.  If a static MPLS tunnel is used as the
      transport tunnel, the configuration need to be at every transit
      node along the path.  For an IP based path, the static
      configuration is similar to the static MPLS case.  This document
      provides data-plane configuration of IP addresses or MPLS labels
      but it does not provide control plane mapping or other aspects.

4.  DetNet Flow Aggregation

   DetNet provides the capability of flow aggregation to improve
   scalability of DetNet data, management and control planes.
   Aggregated flows can be viewed by the some DetNet nodes as individual
   DetNet flows.  When aggregating DetNet flows, the flows should be
   compatible: if bandwidth reservations are used, the reservation
   should be a reasonable representation of the individual reservations;
   if maximum delay bounds are used, the system should ensure that the
   aggregate does not exceed the delay bounds of the individual flows.

   The DetNet YANG model defined in this document supports DetNet flow
   aggregation with the following functions:

   *  Aggregation flow encapsulation/decapsulation/identification

   *  Mapping individual DetNet flows to an aggregated flow

   *  Changing traffic specification parameters for aggregated flow

   The following cases of DetNet aggregation are supported:

   *  Ingress node aggregates App flows into a service sub-layer of
      DetNet flow

   *  In ingress node, the service sub-layers of DetNet flows are
      aggregated into a forwarding sub-layer

   *  In ingress node, the service sub-layers of DetNet flows are
      aggregated into a service sub-layer of an aggregated DetNet flow

   *  Relay node aggregates the forwarding sub-layers DetNet flows into
      a forwarding sub-layer

   *  Relay node aggregates the service sub-layers of DetNet flows into
      a forwarding sub-layer

   *  Relay node aggregates the service sub-layers of DetNet flows into
      a service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet flow

   *  Relay node aggregates the forwarding sub-layers of DetNet flow
      into a service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet flow

   *  Transit node aggregates the forwarding sub-layers of DetNet flows
      into a forwarding sub-layer

   Traffic requirements and traffic specification may be tracked for
   individual or aggregate flows but reserving resources and tracking
   the services in the aggregated flow is out of scope.

5.  DetNet YANG Structure Considerations


   The picture shows that the general structure of the DetNet YANG
   Model:

   There are three instances in DetNet YANG Model: App-flow instance,
   service sub-layer instance and forwarding sub-layer instance,
   respectively corresponding to four parts of DetNet functions defined
   in section 3.

Appendix A.  Examples

   The following examples are provided.  These examples are tested with
   Yanglint and use operational output to exercise both config true and
   config false objects.

   The following are examples of aggregation and disaggregation at
   various points in Detnet.  Figures are provided in the PDF version of
   this document.

A.1.  Example A-1 JSON Configuration/Operational

   This illustrates simple aggregation.  Ingress node 1 aggregates App
   flows 0 and 1 into a service sub-layer of DetNet flow 1.  Two ways of
   illustrating this follow, then the JSON operational data model
   corresponding to the diagrams follows.

A.3.  Example B-2 JSON Service Aggregation Configuration

   This illustrates the service sub-layers of DetNet.  Flows 1 and 2 are
   aggregated into a service sub-layer of aggregated DetNet flow 1.  A
   diagram illustrating this case is shown and then the corresponding
   JSON operational data follows.


   Please consult the PDF or HTML versions for the Case B-2 Diagram.

           Figure 7: Example B-2 DetNet JSON Service Aggregation

A.4.  Example C-1 JSON Relay Aggregation/Disaggregation Configuration

   This illustrates the Relay node 1 aggregating the forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flows 1 and 2 into a forwarding sub-layer.  A
   diagram illustrating both aggregation and disaggregation is shown and
   then the corresponding JSON operational data follows.


   Please consult the PDF or HTML versions for the Case C-1 Diagram.

      Figure 13: Example C-2 DetNet JSON Relay Disaggregation Service
                                 Sub-Layer

A.6.  Example C-3 JSON Relay Service Sub-Layer Aggregation/
      Disaggregation

   This illustrates the Relay node 1 aggregating the service sub-layers
   of DetNet flows 1 and 2 into a service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet
   flow 1.  It also illustrates the Relay node 2 disaggregating the
   aggregated DetNet flow 1 into the DetNet flows 1 and 2 service sub-
   layers.  A diagram illustrating both aggregation and disaggregation
   is shown and then the corresponding JSON operational data follows.


   Please consult the PDF or HTML versions for the Case C-3 Diagram.

A.7.  Example C-4 JSON Relay Service Sub-Layer Aggregation/
      Disaggregation

   This illustrates the Relay node 1 aggregating the forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flow 1 and 2 into a service sub-layer of Aggregated
   DetNet flow 1.  This also illustrates the Relay node 2 disaggregating
   the service sub-layer of Aggregated DetNet flow 1 to forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flow 1 and 2.  A diagram illustrating both
   aggregation and disaggregation is shown and then the corresponding
   JSON operational data follows.

                               Disaggregation

A.8.  Example D-1 JSON Transit Forwarding Sub-Layer Aggregation/
      Disaggregation

   This illustrates the Transit node 1 aggregating the forwarding sub-
   layers of DetNet flow 1 and 2 into a forwarding sub-layer.  This also
   illustrates a Transit node 4 disaggregating a forwarding sub-layer
   into DetNet flow 1 and 2 forwarding sub-layers.
