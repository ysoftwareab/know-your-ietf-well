1. Abstract

   This document specifies a set of policy rule classes (PRC) for
   configuring IPSec policy at IPsec-enabled devices. Instances of
   these classes reside in a virtual information store called the
   IPSec Policy Information Base (PIB). The COPS protocol [COPS] with
   extensions for provisioning [COPS-PR] is used to transmit this
   IPSec policy information to IPSec-enabled devices (e.g., security
   gateways). The PRCs defined in this IPSec PIB are intended for use
   by the COPS-PR IPSec client type. They complement the PRCs defined
   in the Framework PIB [FR-PIB].

3. Introduction

   The policy rule classes (PRC) defined in this document contain
   parameters for IKE phase one and phase two negotiations. Details
   of these parameters can be found in [IPSEC-IM], [IKE], [ESP], [AH]
   [DOI], [IPCOMP] and [SPPI]. The PIB defined in this document is
   based on the IPSec configuration policy model [IPSEC-IM]. The rule
   and role approach proposed in [PCIM], which scales to large
   networks, is adopted for distributing IPsec policy over the COPS
   protocol.


4. Operation Overview

   Following the policy framework convention [PCIM], the management
   entity that downloads policy to IPSec-enabled devices will be
   called a Policy Decision Point (PDP) and the target IPSec-enabled
   devices will be called Policy Execution Points (PEP).

   After connecting to a PDP using COPS-PR, a PEP reports to the PDP
   the PIB Provisioning Classes (PRCs) it supports as well as any
   limitations related to the implementations of theses classes and
   parameters. The PEP provides the above information using the
   frwkPrcSupportTable and the frwkCompLimitsTable defined in the
   framework PIB [FR-PIB]. In addition, the PEP also reports the
   interface type capabilities and role combinations it supports
   using the frwkIfCapSetTable and the frwkIfCapSetRoleComboTable.
   Each row of the frwkIfCapSetTable contains a capability set name
   and a reference to an instance of a PRC that describes the
   capabilities of the interface type. The capability instances may
   reside in the ipSecIfCapsTable or in a table defined in another
   PIB. Each row of the frwkIfCapSetRoleComboTable contains an
   interface capability set name and a role combination.

   Based on the interface capabilities and role combinations, the PDP
   provides the PEP with IPSec PIB that contains IPSec policy. Later
   on, if the interface capabilities or role combinations of the PEP
   change, the PEP MUST notify the PDP. The PDP will then send a new
   PIB to the PEP. In addition, if the policy associated with given
   interface capabilities and role combination change, the PDP MUST
   download a new IPSec PIB to all the PEPs that have registered with
   the interface capabilities and role combination.

   IPsec policy that is pushed down to individual PEP consists of two
   parts: IKE rules for IKE phase one negotiation and IPsec rules for


   Li, et al           Expires January, 2002                       2

   IKE phase two negotiation. These sets of rules may be pushed down
   either together or independently.

   After a PEP reports its interface capabilities and role
   combinations to a PDP,

   - if the corresponding policy consists of IPsec rules only (i.e.,
   key management is not performed through IKE), the interface
   capability set name and the role combination MUST match that in
   the ipSecRuleTable. For the ipSecActionTable referenced by the
   ipSecRuleTable, the values of the ipSecActionIkeRuleId attribute
   MUST be zero, indicating that no IKE associations are used. As a
   result, the ipSecRuleTable and all subsequent referenced tables
   are pushed down to the PEP.

   - if the corresponding policy consists of IKE rules only, the
   interface capability set name and the role combination MUST match
   that in the ipSecIkeRuleTable. The ipSecIkeEndpointTable indicates
   the peer endpoints with which to establish IKE associations.
   Hence, the ipSecIkeRuleTable and all subsequent referenced tables
   are pushed down to the PEP.

   - if the corresponding policy consists of both IPsec rules and IKE
   rules (i.e., IKE association is established first and it is then
   used for IPsec association negotiation), , the interface
   capability set name and the role combination MUST match that in
   the ipSecRuleTable. The ipSecRuleTable and the ipSecIkeRuleTable
   that is referenced by the ipSecRuleTable as well as all subsequent
   referenced tables are pushed down to the PEP.

   The following figure shows the relations between the tables with
   an example. The IPSec policy in this example contains both IKE and
   IPSec rules.

                                  and subsequent tables


4.1 Selector construction

   The ipSecAddressTable specifies individual or a range of IP
   addresses and the ipSecL4PortTable specifies individual or a range
   of layer 4 ports. The ipSecSelectorTable has references to these
   two tables.  Each row in the selector table represents multiple
   selectors. These selectors are constructed as follows:

   1. Substitute the ipSecSelectorSrcAddressGroupId with all the IP
   addresses from the ipSecAddressTable whose ipSecAddressGroupId
   matches the ipSecSelectorSrcAddressGroupId.
   2. Substitute the ipSecSelectorDstAddressGroupId with all the IP
   addresses from the ipSecAddressTable whose ipSecAddressGroupId
   matches the ipSecSelectorDstAddressGroupId.
   3. Substitute the ipSecSelectorSrcPortGroupId with all the ports
   or ranges of port whose ipSecL4PortGroupId matches the
   ipSecSelectorSrcPortGroupId.
   4. Substitute the ipSecSelectorDstPortGroupId with all the ports
   or ranges of port whose ipSecL4PortGroupId matches the
   ipSecSelectorDstPortGroupId.
   5. Construct all the possible combinations of the above four
   fields together with the ipSecSelectorProtocol attribute to form a
   list of five-tuple selectors

   Selectors constructed from the same row inherit all the other
   attributes of the row (e.g., ipSecSelectorGranularity)

   The following is an example for building the selectors (only
   relevant fields are shown). Suppose that the ipSecAddressTable is
   populated with the following rows:

   AddrMin       AddrGroupId
   1.2.3.4           1
   1.2.3.18          1
   5.6.7.1           2
   5.6.7.8           2

   For every row in this example, the AddrMax is a zero length octet
   indicating that each row specifies a single IP address.

   The Layer4PortTable is populated with the following rows:

   Li, et al           Expires January, 2002                       4

                    IPsec Policy Information Base          July, 2001



   PortMin    PortMax    PortGroupId
    112       150            1
    99        99             2

   The PortMax is equal to PortMin in the second row indicating that
   only a single port is specified.

   The ipSecSelectorTable is populated with:

   SrcAddrGpId  dstAddrGpId  srcPortGpId  dstPortGpId  protocol order
     1            2            1            1           udp      1
     1            2            2            2           tcp      2

   The following selectors are constructed:

   SrcAddr    dstAddr    protocol    port
   1.2.3.4    5.6.7.1      UDP      112-150
   1.2.3.4    5.6.7.8      UDP      112-150
   1.2.3.18   5.6.7.1      UDP      112-150
   1.2.3.18   5.6.7.8      UDP      112-150
   1.2.3.4    5.6.7.1      TCP      99
   1.2.3.4    5.6.7.8      TCP      99
   1.2.3.18   5.6.7.1      TCP      99
   1.2.3.18   5.6.7.8      TCP      99

   The first four selectors are constructed from the first row of the
   selector table whose order equals to 1. They can be ordered in any
   way. However, all of them must be evaluated before the selectors
   constructed from the second row because the order of the second
   row equals to 2.

   The use of references in the ipSecSelectorTable instead of
   spelling out all the IP addresses and port numbers reduces the
   number of bytes being pushed down to PEP. Grouping of IP addresses
   and layer four ports serves the same purpose.

4.2 Start up condition

   The establishment of IKE or IPsec associations may be triggered in
   several ways as indicated by ipSecSelectorStartupCondition and
   ipSecIkeEndpointStartupCondition in the ipSecSelectorTable and
   ipSecIkeEndpointTable respectively. The triggers may be:

   OnBoot: IPsec or IKE association is established after system boot.
   To avoid both endpoints trying to set up the same association,
   only the endpoint whose ipSecSelectorIsOriginator
   (ipSecIkeEndpointIsOriginator) is true can initiate the IPsec
   (IKE) association establishment.

   OnTraffic: IPsec association is established only when packets need
   to be sent and there are no appropriate security associations to
   protect the packets. If there is no IKE association to protect the

   Li, et al           Expires January, 2002                       5

                    IPsec Policy Information Base          July, 2001


   IPsec association negotiation, an IKE association should be set up
   first.

   OnPolicy: IPsec or IKE association is established according to
   ipSecRuleTimePeriodSetTable referenced by the corresponding rule.
   At the time the policy becomes active, only the endpoint whose
   ipSecSelectorIsOriginator (ipSecIkeEndpointIsOriginator) is true
   can initiate the IPsec (IKE) association establishment.

   These triggers are not mutually exclusive.


4.3 Multiple security associations, proposals and transforms

   Multiple IPsec security associations may be established to protect
   the same traffic between two end points. The following figure
   shows an example.

                            SA1
        ======================================================
        |                   SA2                              |
        |==============================                      |
        ||                            |                      |
        ||                         ---|----------------------|---
        ||                         |  |                      |  |
        H1  ----- (Internet) ------| SG2  ---- (Local ----- H2  |
                                   |           Intranet)        |
                                   ------------------------------
                                   admin. boundary (optional)


   H1 and H2 are hosts and SG2 is a security gateway on the local
   Intranet where H2 resides. Suppose that to protect TCP traffic
   between H1 and H2, an IPsec security association (SA1) in
   transport mode may be established between H1 and H2. In addition,
   an IPsec security association (SA2) in tunnel mode may be set up
   between H1 and SG2.

   For host H1, it needs to take two actions to protect TCP packets
   that travel from H1 to H2: first protect the packets with SA1 and
   then encapsulate the resulted packets into SA2. This requires that
   the IPSec policy downloaded to H1 contain two actions to be
   applied to packets in order.


   The ipSecRuleIpSecActionGroupId in the ipSecRuleTable is used to
   handle multiple security association establishments or actions. It
   contains references to the actions specified in the
   ipSecActionTable. All the actions in the ipSecActionTable whose
   ipSecActionGroupId matches the ipSecRuleIpSecActionGroupId MUST be
   applied. The ipSecActionOrder indicates the order these actions
   should be taken in setting up the security associations.


   Li, et al           Expires January, 2002                       6

                    IPsec Policy Information Base          July, 2001


   During a security association negotiation, the initiating point
   can present multiple proposals in preference order. For IPsec
   security association, every proposal can contain different
   protocols, e.g., AH, ESP (A single proposal here is equivalent to
   multiple proposal payloads with the same proposal number as
   specified in [ISAKMP]). Different protocols are ANDed. Each
   protocol, in turn, may contain multiple transforms in preference
   order. The responder must select a single proposal and a single
   transform for each protocol.

   Multiple proposals are handled by the ipSecProposalSetTable and
   ipSecIkeProposalSetTable. The ipSecProposalSetOrder and
   ipSecIkeProposalSetOrder in these tables indicate preference.

   Multiple transforms within a protocol are handled by
   ipSecAhTransformSetTable, ipSecEspTransformSetTable and
   ipSecCompTransformSetTable. The IpSecAhTransformSetOrder,
   ipSecEspTransformSetOrder and ipSecCompTransformSetOrder in these
   tables indicate preferences.

4.4 Credentials for IKE phase one negotiation

   Credentials such as certificates may be exchanged during IKE phase
   one negotiation for authentication purpose. An endpoint can
   possess multiple credentials. How each endpoint obtains its
   credentials (e.g., through PKI) is out of the scope of IPsec
   policy distribution. IPsec policy does specify, however, the
   acceptable peer credentials and the credential sub-fields and
   their values that MUST match.

   IpSecPeerCredentialTable specifies a group of credentials that are
   considered acceptable for a given peer endpoint. Any one of the
   credentials in a group is acceptable as the IKE peer endpoint
   credential. IpSecCredentialFieldsTable further specifies, for each
   credential, their sub-fields and values that MUST be matched.


5. Summary of the IPSec PIB

   The IPSec PIB consists of seven groups. Each group and the tables
   it contains are summarized in the following:

   5.1 ipSecSelector Group
   This group specifies the selectors for IPSec associations.

   5.1.1 ipSecAddressTable
   Specifies IP addresses of endpoints.

   5.1.2 ipSecL4PortTable
   Specifies layer four port numbers.

   5.1.3 ipSecSelectorTable

                    IPsec Policy Information Base          July, 2001


   Specifies IPsec selectors. It has references to ipSecAddressTable
   and ipSecL4PortTable for selector constructions.

   5.2 ipSecAssociation Group
   This group specifies attributes related to IPSec Security
   Associations.

   5.2.1 ipSecRuleTable
   Specifies IPsec rules. It references the ipSecSelectorTable and
   ipSecActionTable to indicate that IP packets that match the
   selector SHALL be applied with the IPsec action(s).

   This table also references the ipSecRuleTimePeriodSetTable to
   specify the time periods during which a rule is valid.

   5.2.2 ipSecActionTable
   Specifies group of IPsec actions. All actions that have the same
   ipSecActionActionGroupId belong to the same group. Actions in the
   same group MUST be applied in the order specified by
   ipSecActionOrder.

   This table also references ipSecIkeRuleTable to specify rules
   associated with IKE phase one negotiation.

   5.2.3 ipSecAssociationTable
   Specifies attributes associated with IPsec associations. It
   references ipSecProposalSetTable to specify associated proposals.

   5.2.4 ipSecProposalSetTable
   Specifies IPsec proposal sets. Proposals within a set are ORed
   with preference order.

   5.2.5 ipSecProposalTable
   Specifies an IPsec proposal. It has references to ESP, AH and
   IPComp Transform sets. Within a proposal, different types of
   transforms are ANDed. Within one type of transforms, the choices
   are ORed with preference order.

   5.3 ipSecIkeAssociation Group
   This group specifies attributes related to IKE Security
   Associations

   5.3.1 ipSecIkeRuleTable
   Specifies IKE rules. It contains a reference to
   ipSecIkeAssociationTable to specify IKE associated actions. In
   addition, it has a reference to ipSecIkeEndpointTable to specify
   the endpoints to which this PEP can set up IKE associations.

   This table also references to ipSecRuleTimePeriodSetTable to
   specify the time periods during which a rule is valid.

   5.3.2 ipSecIkeAssociationTable

                    IPsec Policy Information Base          July, 2001


   Specifies attributes related to IKE associations. It references
   ipSecIkeProposalSetTable to specify associated proposals.

   5.3.3 ipSecIkeProposalSetTable
   Specifies IKE proposal sets. Proposals within a set are ORed with
   preference order.

   5.3.4 ipSecIkeProposalTable
   Specifies attributes associated with IKE proposals.

   5.3.5 ipSecIkeEndpointTable
   Specifies the peer endpoints with which this PEP establishes IKE
   associations according to ipSecIkeEndpointStartupCondition.

   This table also contains a reference to ipSecPeerCredentialTable
   to specify acceptable peer credentials.

   5.3.6 ipSecPeerCredentialTable
   Specifies groups of IKE peer credentials. Credentials in a group
   are ORed. In other words, any one of the credentials in a group is
   acceptable as the IKE peer endpoint credential.

   This table also contains a reference to ipSecCredentialFieldsTable
   to further specify sub-field values in a credential that MUST be
   matched.

   5.3.7 ipSecCredentialFieldsTable
   Specifies the sub-fields and their values to be matched against
   peer credentials obtained during IKE phase one negotiation. All
   criteria within a group are ANDed.

   5.4 ipSecEspTransform Group
   This group specifies attributes related to ESP Transform.

   5.4.1 ipSecEspTransformSetTable
   Specifies ESP transform sets. Within a transform set, the choices
   are ORed with preference order.

   5.6.1 ipSecCompTransformSetTable
   Specifies IPComp transform sets. Within a transform set, the
   choices are ORed with preference order.

   5.6.2 ipSecCompTransformTable
   Specifies IPComp transforms.

   5.7 ipSecPolicyTimePeriod Group
   This group specifies the time periods during which a policy rule
   is valid.

   5.7.1 ipSecRuleTimePeriodSetTable
   Specifies multiple time period sets. The ipSecRuleTimePeriodTable
   can specify only a single time period within a day. This table
   enables the specification of multiple time periods within a day by
   grouping them into one set.

   5.7.2 ipSecRuleTimePeriodTable
   Specifies the time periods during which a policy rule is valid.
   The values of the first five attributes in a row are ANDed
   together to determine the validity period(s). If any of the five
   attributes is not present, it is treated as having value always
   enabled.

   5.8 ipSecIfCaps Group
   This group specifies capabilities associated with interface types.

   5.8.1 ipSecIfCapsTable
   Specifies capabilities that may be associated with an interface of
   a specific type. The instances of this table are referenced by the
   frwkIfCapSetCapability attribute of the frwkIfCapSetTable [FR-
   PIB].

     DESCRIPTION
   "An octet string that identifies an overall range of calendar
   dates and times over which a policy rule is valid.  It reuses the
   format for an explicit time period defined in RFC 2445 : a string
   representing a starting date and time, in which the character 'T'
   indicates the beginning of the time portion, followed by the
   solidus character '/', followed by a similar string representing
   an end date and time.  The first date indicates the beginning of
   the range, while the second date indicates the end.  Thus, the
   second date and time must be later than the first.  Date/times are
   expressed as substrings of the form yyyymmddThhmmss.

   There are also two special cases:

   -  If the first date/time is replaced with the string
   THISANDPRIOR, then the property indicates that a policy rule is
   valid [from now] until the date/time that appears after the '/'.

   - If the second date/time is replaced with the string
   THISANDFUTURE, then the property indicates that a policy rule
   becomes valid on the date/time that appears before the '/', and
   remains valid from that point on.

   "An octet string that specifies which days of the week the policy
   is valid for. The octet string is structured as follows:

   - a 4-octet length field, indicating the length of the entire
   octet string; this field is always set to 0x00000005 for this
   property;

   - a 1-octet field consisting of 7 bits identifying the 7 days of
   the week, beginning with Sunday and ending with Saturday, followed
   by 1 bit that is always set to '0'.  For each day of the week, the
   value '1' indicates that the policy is valid for that day, and the
   value '0' indicates that it is not valid.
