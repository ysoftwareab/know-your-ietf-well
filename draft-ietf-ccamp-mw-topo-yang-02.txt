Internet-Draft        Microwave Topology YANG Model         October 2021


1.  Introduction

   This document defines three YANG data models to describe topologies
   of microwave/millimeter wave (hereafter microwave is used to simplify
   the text).  The first YANG data model describes radio links,
   supporting carrier(s) and the associated termination points.  A
   carrier is a description of a link providing transport capacity over
   the air by a single carrier.  It is typically defined by its
   transmitting and receiving frequencies.  A radio link is a link
   providing the aggregated transport capacity of the supporting
   carriers in aggregated and/or protected configurations, which can be
   used to carry traffic on higher topology layers such as Ethernet and
   TDM.  A second YANG data model describes bandwidth availability for a
   link.  It is an important characteristic of a microwave radio link,
   but it could also be applicable for other types of links.  A third
   YANG data model introduces a way to reference the information in a
   YANG data model for interface management [RFC8343] from a termination
   point, which is useful for microwave termination points, but which
   could also be useful for other types of termination points.  All
   three models augment "YANG Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE)
   Topologies" defined in [RFC8795], which is based on "A YANG Data
   Model for Network Topologies" defined in [RFC8345].

   The microwave point-to-point radio technology provides connectivity
   on L0/L1 over a radio link between two termination points, using one
   or several supporting carriers in aggregated or protected
   configurations.  That application of microwave technology cannot be
   used to perform cross-connection or switching of the traffic to
   create network connectivity across multiple microwave radio links.
   Instead, a payload of traffic on higher topology layers, normally L2
   Ethernet, is carried over the microwave radio link and when the
   microwave radio link is terminated at the endpoints, cross-connection
   and switching can be performed on that higher layer creating
   connectivity across multiple supporting microwave radio links.

   The microwave topology, the bandwidth availability, and the interface
   reference models are expected to be used between a Provisioning
   Network Controller (PNC) and a Multi Domain Service Coordinator(MDSC)
   [RFC8453].  Examples of use cases that can be supported are:

   1.  Correlation between microwave radio links and the supported links
       on higher topology layers. e.g. an L2 Ethernet topology.  This
       information can be used to understand how changes in the
       performance/status of a microwave radio link affects traffic on
       higher layers.

Internet-Draft        Microwave Topology YANG Model         October 2021


   2.  Propagation of relevant characteristics of a microwave radio
       link, such as bandwidth, to higher topology layers, where it e.g.
       could be used as a criterion when configuring and optimizing a
       path for a connection/service through the network end to end.

   3.  Optimization of the microwave radio link configurations on a
       network level, e.g. with the purpose to minimize overall
       interference and/or maximize the overall capacity provided by the
       links.

   4.  A microwave radio link could dynamically adjust its bandwidth
       according to changes in the signal conditions.  [RFC8330] defines
       a mechanism to report bandwidth-availability information through
       OSPF-TE, but it could also be useful for a controller to access
       such bandwidth-availability information as part of the topology
       model when performing a path/route computation.

   Different use cases require access to different attributes and in
   order not to restrict what use cases can be supported, all attributes
   supported by the microwave radio link interface management model is
   accessible from the topology model.

1.1.  Terminology and Definitions

   The following acronyms are used in this document:

   PNC Provisioning Network Controller

   MDSC Multi Domain Service Coordinator

1.2.  Tree Structure

   A simplified graphical representation of the data models is used in
   chapters 3.1, 4.1, and 5.1 of this document.  The meaning of the
   symbols in these diagrams is defined in [RFC8340].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.2.  Relationship between radio links and carriers

   A microwave radio link is always an aggregate of one or multiple
   carries, in various configurations/modes.  The supporting carriers
   are identified by its termination points and are listed in the
   container bundled-links as part of the te-link-config in the YANG
   Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies [RFC8795] for a
   radio-link.  The exact configuration of the included carriers is
   further specified in the leaf mode (1+0, 2+0, 1+1, etc.) for the
   radio-link.  Appendix A includes an JSON example of how such a
   relationship can be modelled.

Internet-Draft        Microwave Topology YANG Model         October 2021


3.3.  Relationship with client topology model

   A microwave radio link carries a payload of traffic on higher
   topology layers, normally L2 Ethernet.  The leafs supporting-network,
   supporting-node, supporting-link, and supporting-termination-point in
   the generic YANG module for Network Topologies [RFC8345] are expected
   to be used to model a relationship/dependency from higher topology
   layers to a supporting microwave radio link topology layer.
   Appendix A includes an JSON example of an L2 Ethernet link
   transported over one supporting microwave link.

3.4.  Applicability of the Data Model for Traffic Engineering (TE)
      Topologies

   Since microwave is a point-to-point radio technology providing
   connectivity on L0/L1 over a radio link between two termination
   points and cannot be used to perform cross-connection or switching of
   the traffic to create network connectivity across multiple microwave
   radio links, a majority of the leafs in the Data Model for Traffic
   Engineering (TE) Topologies augmented by the microwave topology model
   are not applicable.  An example of which leafs are considered
   applicable can be found in appendix "Examples of the application of
   the Topology Models" in this document. //Add a proper reference to
   the appendix

   More specifically, admin-status and oper-status are recommended to be
   reported for links only.  Status for termination points can be used
   when links are inter-domain and when the status of only one side of
   link is known, but since microwave is a point-to-point technology
   where both ends normally belong to the same domain it is not expected
   to be applicable in normal cases.  Furthermore, admin-status is not
   applicable for microwave radio links.  Enable and disable of a radio
   link is instead done in the constituent carriers.

3.5.  Model applicability to other technology

   TBD

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define schemas for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   The YANG modules specified in this document import and augment the
   ietf-network and ietf-network-topology models defined in [RFC8345].
   The security considerations from [RFC8345] are applicable to the
   modules in this document.

   There are a several data nodes defined in these YANG modules that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   In the "ietf-microwave-topology" module:

   *  rlt-interface-path: A malicious client could set an arbitrary
      xpath that could allow a client to retrieve incorrect information.
      Troubleshooting would be difficult because the bad path would not
      be detectable until the client tries to use the leaf to identify
      to radio link terminal.

Internet-Draft        Microwave Topology YANG Model         October 2021


   In the "ietf-bandwidth-availability-topology" module:

   *  availability: A malicious client could attempt to modify the
      availability level which could modify the intended behavior.

   *  link-bandwidth: A malicious client could attempt to modify the
      link bandwidth which could either provide more or less link
      bandwidth at the indicated availability level, changing the
      resource allocation in unintended ways.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a new URI from the "IETF XML Registry"
   [RFC3688] as follows:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-bandwidth-availability-topology
   Registrant Contact: The IESG
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.


   It is proposed that IANA should record YANG module names in the "YANG
   Module Names" registry [RFC6020] as follows:

    Name: ietf-microwave-topology
    Maintained by IANA?: N
    Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-microwave-topology
    Prefix: mwtopo
    Reference: RFC XXXX

    Name: ietf-bandwidth-availability-topology
    Maintained by IANA?: N

Appendix A.  Examples of the application of the Topology Models

   This appendix provides some examples and illustrations of how the
   Microwave Topology Model and the Bandwidth Availability Topology
   Model can be used.  There is one extended tree to illustrate the
   complete Microwave Topology Model and a JSON based instantiation of
   the Microwave Topology Model for a small network example.

A.1.  A tree for a complete Microwave Topology Model

   The tree below shows the leafs for a complete Microwave Topology
   Model including the augmented Network Topology Model defined in
   [RFC8345], Traffic Engineering (TE) Topologies model defined in
   [RFC8795] and the associated Bandwidth Availability Model.

A.2.  A topology with single microwave radio link

   Microwave is a transport technology which can be used to transport
   client services, such as L2 Ethernet links.  When an L2 link is
   transported over a single supporting microwave radio link, the
   topologies could be as shown in Figure 3 below.  Note that the figure
   just shows an example, there might be other possibilities to
   demonstrate such a topology.  The example of the instantiation
   encoded in JSON is using only a selected subset of the leafs from the
   L2 topology model [RFC8944] and the Microwave Interface Management
   Model [RFC8561].
