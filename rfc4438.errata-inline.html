1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for information related
   to the Fibre Channel network&#x27;s Name Server function, which provides a
   means for Fibre Channel ports to register and discover Fibre Channel
   attributes.  Such attributes include names, addresses, types,
   features, etc., at various protocol layers.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Short Overview of Fibre Channel

   The Fibre Channel (FC) is logically a bidirectional point-to-point
   serial data channel, structured for high performance.  Fibre Channel
   provides a general transport vehicle for higher-level protocols such
   as Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-
   Performance Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet
   Protocol), IEEE 802.2, and others.

   Physically, Fibre Channel is an interconnection of multiple
   communication points, called N_Ports, interconnected either by a
   switching network, called a Fabric, or by a point-to-point link.  A
   Fibre Channel &quot;node&quot; consists of one or more N_Ports.  A Fabric may
   consist of multiple Interconnect Elements, some of which are
   switches.  An N_Port connects to the Fabric via a port on a switch
   called an F_Port.  When multiple FC nodes are connected to a single
   port on a switch via an &quot;Arbitrated Loop&quot; topology, the switch port
   is called an FL_Port, and the nodes&#x27; ports are called NL_Ports.  The
   term Nx_Port is used to refer to either an N_Port or an NL_Port.  The
   term Fx_Port is used to refer to either an F_Port or an FL_Port.  A
   switch port, which is interconnected to another switch port via an

   Inter-Switch Link (ISL), is called an E_Port.  A B_Port connects a
   bridge device with an E_Port on a switch; a B_Port provides a subset
   of E_Port functionality.

   Many Fibre Channel components, including the Fabric, each node, and
   most ports, have globally-unique names.  These globally-unique names
   are typically formatted as World Wide Names (WWNs).  More information
   on WWNs can be found in [FC-FS].  WWNs are expected to be persistent
   across agent and unit resets.

   Fibre Channel frames contain 24-bit address identifiers, which
   identify the frame&#x27;s source and destination ports.  Each FC port has
   both an address identifier and a WWN.  When a fabric is in use, the
   FC address identifiers are dynamic and are assigned by a switch.
   Each octet of a 24-bit address represents a level in an address
   hierarchy, with a Domain_ID being the highest level of the hierarchy.

   The Fibre Channel Name Server provides a way for N_Ports and NL_Ports
   to register and discover Fibre Channel attributes.  Such attributes
   include names, addresses, types, features, etc., at various protocol
   layers, including upper layer protocols specific to Fibre Channel
   (which are sometimes called &quot;FC-4s&quot;).  Communication with the Name
   Server is via Fibre Channel&#x27;s CT (Common Transport for Generic
   Services) using &quot;Information Units&quot; (called CT_IUs) as either
   requests, responses, or unsolicited.

   Registrations may be performed by a third party.  However, the Name
   Server may refuse such third-party registration for unspecified
   reasons.  Once registered, the attributes are made available to
   requestors.

   Requestors could learn about new registrations via periodic polling
   of the Name Server, but such polling would generate a considerable
   overhead.  To avoid this overhead, the Registered State Change
   Notification (RSCN) mechanism defined in FC-FS [FC-FS] allows an
   Nx_Port to register to receive an RSCN whenever an event occurs that
   may affect the state of other Nx_Port(s), including changes in the
   information registered with the Name Server.

   The Fibre Channel Name Server is defined in the FC-GS specification,
   The latest specification is [FC-GS-4]; the previous version was
   [FC-GS-3].

4.  Relationship to Other MIBs

   The first standardized MIB for Fibre Channel [RFC2837] was focused on
   Fibre Channel switches.  It was obsoleted by the more generic Fibre
   Channel Management MIB [FC-MGMT], which defines basic information for
   Fibre Channel hosts and switches, including extensions to the
   standard IF-MIB [IF-MIB] for Fibre Channel interfaces.

   This MIB extends beyond [FC-MGMT] to cover the functionality, in
   Fibre Channel switches, of providing Fibre Channel&#x27;s Name Server
   function.

   This MIB also imports some common textual conventions from
   T11-TC-MIB, defined in [FC-FAM-MIB].

5.  MIB Overview

   This MIB module provides the means for monitoring the operation of,
   and configuring some parameters of, one or more instances of Fibre
   Channel Name Server functionality.  (Note that there are no
   definitions in this MIB module of &quot;managed actions&quot; that can be
   invoked via SNMP.)

5.1.  Fibre Channel Management Instance

   A Fibre Channel management instance is defined in [FC-MGMT] as a
   separable managed instance of Fibre Channel functionality.  Fibre
   Channel functionality may be grouped into Fibre Channel management
   instances in whatever way is most convenient for the
   implementation(s).  For example, one such grouping accommodates a
   single SNMP agent having multiple AgentX [RFC2741] sub-agents, with
   each sub-agent implementing a different Fibre Channel management
   instance.

   The object, fcmInstanceIndex, is IMPORTed from the FC-MGMT-MIB
   [FC-MGMT] as the index value to uniquely identify each Fibre Channel
   management instance within the same SNMP context ([RFC3411], section
   3.3.1).

5.2.  Name Server Information Subset

   In addition to allowing for multiple Fibre Channel management
   instances, this MIB is based on the notion that the information
   registered with the Name Server is available as one or more subsets.
   The MIB allows the different subsets to be accessed either:

      - via different SNMP agents/contexts,
      - via different Fibre Channel management instances within the
        same SNMP agent/context, and/or
      - via the same Fibre Channel management instance within the
        same SNMP agent/context.

   The union of these subsets (across all agents/contexts in the
   network) represents the total set of information registered with the
   Name Server.  Note that the intersection of the subsets is often
   non-empty, and the use of the term &quot;subset&quot; does not preclude any
   subset from containing the complete set of Name Server information.
   Each of these subsets is identified using an index value called a
   Name Server Information Subset Index.

   Thus, all objects in this MIB are in tables that are INDEXed by at
   least fcmInstanceIndex and t11NsInfoSubsetIndex, where the latter
   contains a Name Server Information Subset Index value.

5.3.  Fabric Index

   The [FC-SW-3] standard for an interconnecting Fabric consisting of
   multiple Fabric Switch elements describes the operation of a single
   Fabric in a physical infrastructure.  The current [FC-SW-4] standard
   also supports the operation of multiple Virtual Fabrics operating
   within one (or more) physical infrastructures.  In such a scenario,
   each Fabric has, of course, its own management instrumentation.  In
   order to accommodate this scenario, this MIB module defines all
   Fabric-related information in tables that are INDEXed by an arbitrary
   integer, named a &quot;Fabric Index&quot;.  In a Fabric that is conformant to
   [FC-SW-3], the value of this Fabric Index will always be 1.

5.4.  The MIB Groups

   This section describes the six MIB groups contained in the MIB.

5.4.1.  The t11NsDBGroup Group

   This group contains information about the operation of the Name
   Server function acting upon a Name Server Information Subset,
   including an indication of whether such operation is performed local
   to a particular Fibre Channel switch, or independently of a Fibre
   Channel switch.  It also contains the information currently
   registered in a particular Name Server Information Subset.

5.4.2.  Three Statistics Groups

   There are three groups of Name Server statistics objects:

        t11NsRequestStatsGroup -- stats about requests
        t11NsRscnStatsGroup    -- stats about (Name Server) RSCNs
        t11NsRejectStatsGroup  -- stats about rejects

   Each of these groups is conditionally mandatory; specifically, each
   group contains objects for particular statistics such that
   implementation of the group is mandatory only for an implementation
   that counts/captures the group&#x27;s particular statistics.

   The intent here is not to force implementations to capture these
   statistics, but rather to have all implementations that do capture
   them, provide access to them via the same MIB objects.

5.4.3.  The t11NsNotifyGroup Group

   This group contains a set of notifications that provide for
   monitoring the rejections of Name Server Registration Requests.

5.4.4.  The t11NsNotifyControlGroup Group

   This group contains objects for controlling the generation of, and
   for information to be included in, the notifications defined in the
   t11NsNotifyGroup group.

5.5.  The Actual Values of Objects

   The objects defined in the t11NsRegTable represent the values
   registered with the Name Server.  The SNMP agent MUST report the
   actual values, even if they are incorrectly formatted.  This is the
   reason why, for example, the two objects that represent IP addresses,
   t11NsNodeIpAddress and t11NsPortIpAddress, have the SYNTAX of OCTET
   STRING, so that they are able to represent invalid values (which
   could not be represented using InetAddressType and InetAddress).

   Similarly, each set of (t11NsRejectReasonCode, t11NsRejReasonCodeExp,
   t11NsRejReasonVendorCode) objects must hold the values of the actual
   reject, explanation, and vendor-specific codes that were present in
   the generated Reject message (the &quot;Reject CT_IU&quot;), irrespective of
   whether or not such code values were appropriate.

    DESCRIPTION
           &quot;The FC-4 Features associated with FC-4 Types on this
           port encoded as a 128-byte value in network-byte order,
           or the zero-length string if no &#x27;FC-4 Features&#x27; have been
           registered.

           Section 5.2.3.15 of FC-GS-4 is the authoritative
           definition of the format of the 128-byte value,
           i.e., if different, FC-GS-4 takes precedence over the
           following description:

           The 128-byte value is an array of 4-bit values, one for
           each FC-4 Type value, positioned as follows: the 5 most
           significant bits of a Type value identify where it appears
           within the 128-byte value, specifically, within which word:

                 - Word 0 (of the 128-byte value) contains information
                   related to Types &#x27;00&#x27; through &#x27;07&#x27;;
                 - Word 1 contains information related to Types
                   &#x27;08&#x27; through 0F&#x27;;
                 - and so forth, up to Word 31, which contains
                   information related to Types &#x27;F8&#x27; through &#x27;FF&#x27;.

           The least significant of the eight 4-bit values in each
           Word represents an FC-4 Type with 000 as its 3 least
           significant bits, and most significant 4-bit value in
           each Word represents an FC-4 Type with 111 as its 3 least
           significant bits.&quot;

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned a MIB OID to the T11-FC-NAME-SERVER-MIB module
   under the appropriate subtree.

11.  Security Considerations

   There is one management object defined in this MIB module with a
   MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects may
   be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   The support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without
   proper protection can have a negative effect on network operations.
   This object and its sensitivity/vulnerability is:

      t11NsInfoSubsetRejReqNotfyEnable -- the ability to enable/disable
                                          notifications.

   Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
   network environments.  For example, the ability to change network
   topology or network speed may afford an attacker the ability to
   obtain better performance at the expense of other network users.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on network operations.

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

      t11NsRegTable -- contains information about registered Nx_Ports.

      t11NsStatsTable -- contains statistics and state information about
                         the Name Server.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementors consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
