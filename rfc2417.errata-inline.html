Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes managed objects for IP hosts and routers
   that use a Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS) to support IP
   multicast over ATM, as described in &#x27;Support for Multicast over UNI
   3.0/3.1 based ATM Networks&#x27; [1].

   This memo specifies a MIB module in a manner that is both compliant
   to the SNMPv2 SMI, and semantically identical to the peer SNMPv1
   definitions.

1.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of these
   components.  They are:

   o    the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [2] - the mechanisms used for
        describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

   o    the Textual Conventions, described in RFC 1903 [3] for SNMPv2.

   o    the Conformance Statements, described in RFC 1904 [4] for
        SNMPv2.

   o    the Simple Network Management Protocol, described in
        STD 15, RFC 1157 [5].

   o    the Protocol Operations, described in RFC 1905 [6] for
        SNMPv2.

   o    the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [7] - the core set of managed
        objects for the Internet suite of protocols for SNMPv2.

   The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
   experimentation and evaluation.

1.1.  Object Definitions

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1)
   defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is named by an
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.  The object

   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to
   the object type.

2.  Overview

   This MARS MIB is designed to define managed objects that can be used
   to manage the MARS clients, servers, and the multicast servers (MCS),
   as described in the RFC2022[1].  The MIB is supposed to be used on a
   system where one or more MARS clients are running, or where one or
   more MARS servers are running, or where one or more MARS multicast
   servers are running.

   An understanding of MARS, as defined in [1] is assumed in this MIB
   module definition. However, the following terms are used frequently
   and are included here for reference:

   Multicast Group

   A group of endpoints that communicate with each other such that
   packets sent from one endpoint are received by all other members of
   the multicast group.

   Multicast Address Resolution Server (MARS)

   A server that distributes multicast group membership information to
   endpoints.

   Client/Endpoint

   An ATM-attached host or router that registers with a MARS and that is
   a member of one or more multicast groups. An endpoint may establish
   ATM Virtual Channels (VCs) to the other group members or may make use
   of a Multicast Server.

   Cluster

   The set of clients managed by a MARS.

   Multicast Server (MCS)

   A server that sets up ATM Virtual Channels (VCs) between endpoints in
   a multicast group and to which the endpoints forward data traffic for
   transmission on their behalf.

   The MIB is broken down into three major groups: a MARS client group,
   MARS (server) group, and MARS Multicast Server (MCS) Group.

2.1.  The MARS Client Group

   This client group defines a collection of objects required to be
   implemented in a MIB for the management of MARS clients. It contains
   the following tables:

   o    MARS Client Table

   Information about a client such as its ATM address, the ATM address
   of its default MARS, registration status, and timers.

   o    MARS Client Multicast Group Table

   A list of IP multicast address blocks associated with a MARS client.

   o    MARS Client Backup MARS Group Table

   A list of backup MARS&#x27;s associated with a MARS client.

   o    MARS Client VC Table

   Information about VCs opened by a client.

   o    MARS Client Statistics Table

   Statistics collected by a MARS client.

2.2.  The MARS Server Group

   This MARS server group defines a collection of objects required to be
   implemented in a MIB for the management of MARS servers.  It contains
   the following tables:

   o    MARS Table

   Information about a MARS such as its ATM address, its status and
   timers.

   o    MARS Multicast Group Table

   A list of IP multicast address blocks associated with a MARS.

   o    MARS VC Table

   Information about VCs opened by a MARS.

   o    MARS Registered Client Table

   A list of clients registered with a MARS.

   o    MARS Registered Multicast Server Table

   A list of MCSs registered with a MARS.

   o    MARS Statistics Table

   Statistics collected by a MARS.

   o    MARS Host Map Table

   Mappings between multicast groups and clients maintained by a MARS.

   o    MARS Server Map Table

   Mappings between multicast groups and MCSs maintained by a MARS.

2.3.  The MARS Multicast Server Group

   This MARS multicast server group defines a collection of objects
   required to be implemented in a MIB for the management of MARS
   multicast servers. It contains the following tables:

   This group contains the following tables:

   o    MARS Multicast Server Table

   Information about a MCS, such as its ATM address, default MARS ATM
   address, and registration state.

   o    MARS MCS Multicast Group Table

   A list of IP multicast address blocks associated with a MARS MCS.

   o    MARS MCS Backup Mars Group Table

   A list of backup MARS&#x27;s associated with a MARS MCS.

   o    MARS Multicast Server VC Table

   Information about VCs opened by a MCS.

   o    MARS Multicast Server Statistics Table

   Statistics collected by a MCS.

            A row cannot be made &#x27;active&#x27; until instances of

            are appropriately configured and until the agent
            has also created a corresponding row in the
            marsClientStatTable.

            When this object has a value of &#x27;active&#x27;, the
            following columnar objects can not be modified:

            whether or not a row in any associated tables
            (i.e., marsClientVcTable) still exists or is in

            that the agent or the SNMP management station
            (if possible) through the set command deletes
            any stale rows that are associated with this
            row.&quot;

            address.  In the case of point to multipoint connection
            where a single source address is associated with
            multiple destinations, several entries are used to
            represent the relationship.  An example of point to

            It is possible for an SNMP management station
            to set the row to &#x27;notInService&#x27; and modify

            marsMcsVcType has a value of &#x27;svc&#x27; can not

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   object may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and SET
   (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2274 [8] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2275 [9] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give
   access to those objects only to those principals (users) that have a
   legitimate rights to indeed SET (change/create/delete) them.

   Note: read-access in fact may also need access-control.
