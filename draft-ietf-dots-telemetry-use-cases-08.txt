                 draft-ietf-dots-telemetry-use-cases-08

Abstract

   Denial-of-service Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) Telemetry enriches the
   base DOTS protocols to assist the mitigator in using efficient DDoS-
   attack-mitigation techniques in a network.  This document presents
   sample use cases for DOTS Telemetry: what components are deployed in
   the network, how they cooperate, and what information is exchanged to
   effectively use these techniques.

1.  Introduction

   Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, such as volumetric attacks and
   resource-consumption attacks, are critical threats to be handled by
   service providers.  When such DDoS attacks occur, service providers
   have to mitigate them immediately to protect or recover their
   services.

   Therefore, for service providers to immediately protect their network
   services from DDoS attacks, DDoS mitigation needs to be highly
   automated.  To that aim, multi-vendor components involved in DDoS
   attack detection and mitigation should cooperate and support standard
   interfaces.

Internet-Draft          DOTS Telemetry Use Cases           February 2022


   DDoS Open Threat Signaling (DOTS) is a set of protocols for real-time
   signaling, threat-handling requests, and data filtering between the
   multi-vendor elements [RFC9132][RFC8783].  DOTS Telemetry enriches
   the DOTS protocols with various telemetry attributes allowing optimal
   DDoS attack mitigation [I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry].  This document
   presents sample use cases for DOTS Telemetry, which makes concrete
   overview and purpose described in [I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry]: what
   components are deployed in the network, how they cooperate, and what
   information is exchanged to effectively use attack-mitigation
   techniques.

2.  Terminology

   The readers should be familiar with the terms defined in [RFC8612]
   and [I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry].

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   Top-talker:  A list of attack sources that are involved in an attack
      and which are generating an important part of the attack traffic.

   Supervised Machine Learning:  A machine-learning technique in which
      labeled data is used to train the algorithms (the input and output
      data are known).

   Unsupervised Machine Learning:  A machine learning technique in which
      unlabeled data is used to train the algorithms (the data has no
      historical labels).

3.  Telemetry Use Cases

   This section describes DOTS telemetry use cases that use attributes
   included in DOTS telemetry specifications [I-D.ietf-dots-telemetry].

3.1.  Mitigation Resources Assignment

3.1.1.  Mitigating Attack Flow of Top-talker Preferentially

   Recent reported large DDoS attacks which exceeded 1 Tps. Some transit
   providers have to mitigate such large-scale DDoS attacks using DMSes
   (DDoS Mitigation System) with limited resources, which is already
   deployed in their network.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to use their
   DMS efficiently under volume-based DDoS attacks whose volume is more
   than the available capacity of the DMS.  To enable this, the attack
   traffic of top talkers is redirected to the DMS preferentially by
   cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow collectors, and

   orchestrators.  Figure 1 gives an overview of this use case.

   Figure 2: Example of Message Body to Signal Top-Talkers

   In this use case, the forwarding nodes send statics of traffic flow
   to the flow collectors using, e.g., IPFIX [RFC7011].  When DDoS
   attacks occur, the flow collectors identifies the attack traffic and
   send information of the top-talkers to the orchestrator using the
   "target-prefix" and "top-talkers" telemetry attributes.  The
   orchestrator, then, checks the available capacity of the DMSes by
   using a network management protocol, such as SNMP [RFC3413].  After

   that, the orchestrator orders forwarding nodes to redirect as much of
   the top talker's traffic to the DMS as possible by dissemination of
   flow-specification-rules relying upon tools, such as BGP Flowspec
   [RFC8955].

   In this use case, the flow collector implements a DOTS client while
   the orchestrator implements a DOTS server.

3.1.2.  Optimal DMS Selection for Mitigation

   Transit providers can deploy their DMSes in clusters.  Then, they can
   select the DMS to be used to mitigate a DDoS attack under attack
   time.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select an
   optimal DMS for mitigation based on the volume of the attack traffic
   and the capacity of a DMS.  Figure 3 gives an overview of this use
   case.  Figure 4 provides an example of a DOTS telemetry message body
   that is used to signal various attack traffic percentiles.

   Figure 4: Example of Message Body with Total Attack Traffic

   In this use case, the forwarding nodes send statics of traffic flow
   to the flow collectors using, e.g., IPFIX [RFC7011].  When DDoS
   attacks occur, the flow collectors identify attack traffic and send
   information of the attack traffic volume to the orchestrator using
   the "target-prefix" and "total-attack-traffic" telemetry attributes.
   The orchestrator, then, checks the available capacity of the DMSes
   using a network management protocol, such as SNMP [RFC3413].  After
   that, the orchestrator selects an optimal DMS to which each attack
   traffic should be redirected.  For example, the simple algorithm of
   the selection is to choose a DMS whose available capacity is greater
   than the "peak-g".  The orchestrator then orders the appropriate
   forwarding nodes to redirect the attack traffic to the optimal DMS by
   a routing protocol such as BGP [RFC4271].  The detailed DMS selection
   algorithm is out of the scope of this document.

   In this use case, the flow collector implements a DOTS client while
   the orchestrator implements a DOTS server.

3.1.3.  Best-path Selection for Redirection

   A transit provider network has multiple paths to convey attack
   traffic to a DMS.  In such a network, the attack traffic can be
   conveyed while avoiding congested links by selecting an available
   path.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select an
   optimal path for redirecting attack traffic to a DMS according to the
   bandwidth of the attack traffic and total traffic.  Figure 5 gives an
   overview of this use case.  Figure 6 provides an example of a DOTS
   telemetry message body that is used to signal various attack traffic
   percentiles and total traffic percentiles.

   In this use case, the forwarding nodes send statics of traffic flow
   to the flow collectors using, e.g., IPFIX [RFC7011].  When DDoS
   attacks occur, the flow collectors identify attack traffic and send
   information of the attack traffic volume to the orchestrator using a
   "target-prefix" and "total-attack-traffic" telemetry attributes.  On
   the other hands, forwarding nodes send volume of the total traffic
   passing the node to the orchestrator using "total-traffic" telemetry
   attributes.  The orchestrator then selects an optimal path to which
   each attack-traffic flow should be redirected.  For example, the
   simple algorithm of the selection is to choose a path whose available
   capacity is greater than the "peak-g".  After that, the orchestrator
   orders the appropriate forwarding nodes to redirect the attack
   traffic to the optimal DMS by dissemination of flow-specification-
   rules relying upon tools, such as BGP Flowspec [RFC8955].  The
   detailed path selection algorithm is out of the scope of this
   document.

3.1.4.  Short but Extreme Volumetric Attack Mitigation

   Short, but extreme volumetric attacks, such as pulse wave DDoS
   attacks, are threats to internet transit provider networks.  The
   feature of the attack is that start from zero and go to maximum
   values in a very short time span, then go back to zero, and back to
   maximum, repeating in continuous cycles at short intervals.  It is
   difficult for them to mitigate an attack by DMS by redirecting attack
   flows because it may cause route flapping in the network.  The
   practical way to mitigate short but extreme volumetric attacks is to
   offload mitigation actions to a forwarding node.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to mitigate
   short but extreme volumetric attacks.  Furthermore, the aim is to
   estimate the network-access success rate based on the bandwidth of
   attack traffic.  Figure 7 gives an overview of this use case.
   Figure 8 provides an example of a DOTS telemetry message body that is
   used to signal total pipe capacity.  Figure 9 provides an example of
   a DOTS telemetry message body that is used to signal various attack
   traffic percentiles and total traffic percentiles.

   In this use case, when DDoS attacks occur, the network management
   system receives alerts.  Then, it sends the target IP address and
   volume of the DDoS attack traffic to the administrative system using
   the "target-prefix" and "total-attack-traffic" telemetry attributes.
   After that, the administrative system orders upper forwarding nodes
   to carry out rate-limit all traffic destined to the target based on
   the pipe capability by the dissemination of the flow-specification-
   rules relying upon tools, such as BGP Flowspec [RFC8955].  In
   addition, the administrative system estimates the network-access
   success rate of the target, which is calculated by total-pipe-
   capability / (total-pipe-capability + total-attack-traffic).  Note
   that total pipe capability information can be gatherd by telemetry
   setup in advance.

3.1.5.  Selecting Mitigation Technique Based on Attack Type

   Some volumetric attacks, such as amplification attacks, can be
   detected with high accuracy by checking the Layer 3 or Layer 4
   information of attack packets.  These attacks can be detected and
   mitigated through cooperation among forwarding nodes and flow
   collectors using IPFIX [RFC7011].  On the other hand, it is necessary
   to inspect the Layer 7 information of attack packets to detect
   attacks such as DNS Water Torture Attacks.  Such attack traffic
   should be detected and mitigated at a DMS.

   The aim of this use case is to enable transit providers to select a
   mitigation technique based on the type of attack traffic:
   amplification attack or not.  To use such a technique, attack traffic
   is blocked at forwarding nodes or redirected to a DMS based on attack
   type through cooperation among forwarding nodes, flow collectors, and
   an orchestrator.  Figure 10 gives an overview of this use case.
   Figure 11 provides an example of attack mappings as below are shared
   using data-channel in advance.  Figure 12 provides an example of a
   DOTS telemetry message body that is used to signal various attack
   traffic percentiles, total traffic percentiles, total attack
   connection and attack type.

   In this use case, attack mappings are shared using data channel in
   advance.  The forwarding nodes send statics of traffic flow to the
   flow collectors using, e.g., IPFIX [RFC7011].  When DDoS attacks
   occur, the flow collectors identify attack traffic and send attack
   type information to the orchestrator the using "vendor-id" and
   "attack-id" telemetry attributes.  The orchestrator then resolves
   abused port and orders forwarding nodes to block the amp attack
   traffic flow by dissemination of flow-specification-rules relying
   upon tools, such as BGP Flowspec [RFC8955].  On the other hand, the
   orchestrator orders forwarding nodes to redirect other traffic than
   the amp attack traffic by a routing protocol such as BGP [RFC4271].

   In this use case, the flow collector implements a DOTS client while
   the orchestrator implements a DOTS server.

3.2.  Detailed DDoS Mitigation Report

   It is possible for the transit provider to add value to the DDoS
   mitigation service by reporting on-going and detailed DDoS
   countermeasure status to the enterprise network.  In addition, it is
   possible for the transit provider to know whether the DDoS counter
   measure is effective or not by receiving reports from the enterprise
   network.

   The aim of this use case is to share the information about on-going
   DDoS counter measure between the transit provider and the enterprise
   network mutually.  Figure 13 gives an overview of this use case.
   Figure 14 provides an example of a DOTS telemetry message body that
   is used to signal total pipe capacity from the enterprise network
   administrator to the orchestrator in the ISP.  Figure 15 provides an
   example of a DOTS telemetry message body that is used to signal
   various total traffic percentiles, total attack traffic percentiles
   and attack detail from the orchestrator to the network .

Figure 15: Example of Message Body with Total Traffic, Total Attack Traffic Protocol and Attack Detail

   In this use case, the network management system in the enterprise
   network reports limits of incoming traffic volume from the transit
   provider to the orchestrator in the transit provider in advance.  It
   is reported by using "total-pipe-capacity" telemetry attribute in
   DOTS telemetry setup.

Internet-Draft          DOTS Telemetry Use Cases           February 2022


   When DDoS attacks occur, DDoS Orchestration [RFC8903] is carried out
   in the transit provider.  Then, the DDoS mitigation systems reports
   status of DDoS counter measure to the orchestrator sending "attack-
   detail" telemetry attributes.  After that, the orchestrator
   integrates the reports from the DDoS mitigation system, while
   removing duplicate contents, and send it to network administrator
   using DOTS telemetry periodically.

   During the DDoS mitigation, the orchestrator in the transit provider
   retrieves link congestion status from the network administrator in
   the enterprise network using "total-traffic" telemetry attributes.
   Then, the orchestrator checks whether DDoS countermeasure is
   effective or not by comparing the "total-traffic" and the "total-
   pipe-capacity".

   In this use case, the DMS implements a DOTS server while the
   orchestrator implements a DOTS client and server in the transit
   provider.  In addition, the network administrator implements a DOTS
   client.

3.3.  Tuning Mitigation Resources

3.3.1.  Supervised Machine Learning of Flow Collector

   DDoS detection based on tools, such as IPFIX [RFC7011], is a lighter
   weight method of detecting DDoS attacks than DMSes in internet
   transit provider networks.  On the other hand, DDoS detection based
   on the DMSes is a more accurate method of detecting attack traffic or
   DDoS attacks better than flow monitoring.

   The aim of this use case is to increases flow collector's detection
   accuracy by carrying out supervised machine-learning techniques
   according to attack detail reported by the DMSes.  To use such a
   technique, forwarding nodes, flow collector, and a DMS should
   cooperate.  Figure 16 gives an overview of this use case.  Figure 17
   provides an example of a DOTS telemetry message body that is used to
   signal various total attack traffic percentiles and attack detail.

   Figure 17: Example of Message Body with Attack Type and Top Talkers

   In this use case, the forwarding nodes send statics of traffic flow
   to the flow collectors using, e.g., IPFIX [RFC7011].  When DDoS
   attacks occur, DDoS orchestration use case [RFC8903] is carried out
   and the DMS mitigates all attack traffic destined for a target.  The
   DDoS-mitigation system reports the "vendor-id", "attack-id" and "top-
   talker" telemetry attributes to the flow collector.

   After mitigating a DDoS attack, the flow collector attaches teacher
   labels, which shows normal traffic or attack type, to the statistics
   of traffic flow of top-talkers based on the reports.  The flow
   collector then carries out supervised machine learning to increase
   its detection accuracy, setting the statistics as an explanatory
   variable and setting the labels as an objective variable.

   In this use case, the DMS implements a DOTS client while the flow
   collector implements a DOTS server.

3.3.2.  Unsupervised Machine Learning of Flow Collector

   DMSes can detect DDoS attack traffic, which means DMSes can also
   identify clean traffic.  The aim of this use case is to carry out
   unsupervised machine-learning for anomaly detection according to
   baseline reported by DMSes.  To use such a technique, forwarding
   nodes, flow collector, and a DMS should cooperate.  Figure 18 gives
   an overview of this use case.  Figure 19 provides an example of a
   DOTS telemetry message body that is used to signal baseline.

   Figure 19: Example of Message Body with Baseline

   In this use case, the forwarding nodes carry out mirroring traffic
   destined IP address.  The DMS then identifies "clean" traffic and
   reports the baseline attributes to the flow collector using DOTS
   telemetry.

   The flow collector then carries out unsupervised machine learning to
   be able to carry out anomaly detection.

   In this use case, the DMS implements a DOTS client while the flow
   collector implements a DOTS server.
