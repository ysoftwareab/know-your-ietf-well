1. Introduction

Under the current DNS (domain name system), the IP address (which 
is a combination of numbers) and the domain name are used. The 
purpose of the domain name is to use more familiar and memorable 
names than the IP address. Nevertheless, because of the restriction of 
using only US-ASCII characters in domain names, and although some 
persons don't speak English, they have to use unfamiliar English 
domain names. For them, it may not be much different from an IP 
address.

As a result, it is difficult to find home pages of even famous 
companies without knowing their English domain names in advance. 
The top level domains are designated in English for international 
recognition. As for the second level domain, we have also used 
English letters by using abbreviated English words which almost seem 
to be secret codes (for example, ac, co, go, or, re, nm, etc.). We have 
to write as a 2LD `.Seoul.kr' instead of Korean Seoul. 

Furthermore, in order to control computers and use the Internet with 
voice orders in the future, multilingual domain names are 
indispensable.

        Multilingual domain name divided by characters key 


  "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document 
  are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
  
  A multilingual domain name means the domain name expressed in 
  the native language in the user's interface.
  
  A traditional domain name means the domain name compatible 
  with the current DNS.
  
  A converted domain name is the same as the traditional domain 
  name but it is converted from a multilingual one to be compatible 
  with the current DNS.
  
  A character substitute is a 'string of ASCII characters' that replaces 
  a native character in a multilingual domain name when the name is 
  converted into a traditional one.
  
  A multilingual key is a character assembly located at a specific 
  position of the converted domain name and represents that it is the 
  converted domain name from a multilingual one.
  
  A language key represents the language from which the domain has 
  been converted into the converted domain names. 
  
  
  1-2. Summary
  
  According to [RFC1034], domain names must start with a letter (a 
  through z), end with a letter or digit (0 through 9), and have only 
  letters, digits, and hyphen as interior characters in the current DNS. 
  Therefore native characters in a multilingual domain name must be 
  converted into US-ASCII characters in order to register or log in.
  
  Hence, 'character substitutes' are made to express native characters 
  (in the multilingual domain name) with US-ASCII characters. To 
  distinguish converted domain names from traditional ones, a 
  'multilingual key' is defined and added to every converted domain 
  name. To represent the language from which the domain has been 
  converted, the 'language keys' are assigned for every language
  
  In this system, when a multilingual domain name is converted to the 
  traditional domain name;
  1) The multilingual key will be included automatically in All 
     converted domain names.
  2) The language key will be included automatically in the converted 
     domain name.
  3) All characters will be replaced by 'character substitutes'.
  
  The conversion from a multilingual name to a traditional one, or the 
  reverse conversion from a converted name to the original one

        Multilingual domain name divided by characters key 


  (multilingual), is performed by the conversion program installed on 
  the user's computer. The conversion program will run when the user 
  inputs the domain name including his/her own language and begins 
  to use the Internet services. For the display on the screen, by the 
  multilingual key included in the domain name, the program will be 
  run. Therefore, users can use all the Internet services in their own 
  language at their convenience.
  
  
  
2. Multilingual key

By placing `a certain specific ASCII characters' in a certain `specific 
location' in the domain name, a "multilingual key" that represents a 
converted domain name from a multilingual one, can be made with 
this `specific character in the specific location'. When a domain 
includes this `multilingual key' at the specific location, the 
`multilingual key' indicates that the domain name was converted from 
the multilingual one.

When a user inputs a multilingual domain name that includes his/her 
native language in order to log in, the system adds this multilingual 
key with a language key first and converts it into a traditional domain 
name. 

For display, the system checks whether the multilingual key is 
contained. If so, according to the language key, the system converts 
that domain name to a multilingual one.

Note. To avoid confusion, the multilingual key should be a 
character(s) that is not commonly used. Further, it is recommended 
that the domain name, containing the same character(s) in the same 
location, not be registered as the traditional domain name.


3. Language key

One or two US-ASCII characters are assigned as a 'language key' for 
every language currently defined by ISO 10646/Unicode. This 
language key follows the 'multilingual key' in the converted domain 
names and represents the kind of language from which the domain has 
been converted. 

By separating domains according to language, multilingual characters 
can be expressed in minimum numbers of ASCII characters. 

If the language key is not for the user's native language, but for other 
languages, the system shall not convert and display it to the monitor as 
ASCII characters.

        Multilingual domain name divided by characters key 


As a language key, if two ASCII characters are given for every 
language (like kr, jp, cn), we can manage 1,296 languages (=36x36) 
theoretically.



4. Sequence of 36 characters 

In order to substitute all characters (used in multilingual names) by 
the least number of US-ASCII when the multilingual domain name 
converts into a traditional name, the 'sequence of 36 characters' is 
made with letters(a-z) and digits(0-9) of 36 characters. They 36 
characters may be used in the middle or at the end of the domain name. 



5. Composition of Character substitute

Character substitute consists of the following:
a. Separate characters currently defined (and being added) by 
   ISO10646/Unicode according to native languages.
b. For each language, all of native characters as well as alphabets and 
   digits are arranged in the 'sequence of 36 characters'.
c. Set the arranged 'sequence of 36 characters' as the 'character 
   substitute' for the character.

According to the entire numbers of characters of one language, assign 
as follows:


  5.1. In case the number of characters is below 36; 


    5.1.1. When the number of characters is below 9;

      5.1.1.1. Assign multilingual characters 1-9, and digits (0-9) to 
      00-09. The alphabets (a-z) are used as they are without any 
      character substitutes.

      5.1.1.2. As an alternative to 5.1.1.1 this arrangement may be 
               used:
      Assign multilingual characters to the 01-09 of the `sequence of 
      36 characters' and the number '0(zero)' to '00'. digits (1-9) 
      and the alphabets (a-z)  are used as they are without any 
      character substitutes.
      

    5.1.2. When the number of characters is above 9 and below 26;

      5.1.2.1. Assign multilingual characters to a-z, and the alphabet 
      a-z to 0a-0z, and digits (0-9) are used as they are without any 
      character substitutes. 

      5.1.2.2. As an alternative to 5.1.2.1 this arrangement may be 
               used;
      Assign multilingual characters to 0a-0z, and digits 
      (0-9) and the alphabets (a-z) are used as they are without any 
      character substitutes 

    5.1.3. When the number of characters is above 26 and below 35;

      5.1.3.1. Assign multilingual characters to 1-z in the order, and 
               digits (0-9) and alphabets (a-z) to 00-0z.

      5.1.3.2. As an alternative to 5.1.3.1 this arrangement may be 
               used;
      Assign multilingual characters to 01-0z, digit 0 to 00 and digits 
      of 1-9 and alphabets (a-z) are used as they are without any 
      substitution.
      

  5.2. In case the number of characters is above 36 characters;

    5.2.1. digits, alphabets and hyphen.

    Assign digits (0-9) and alphabets (a-z) to 00-0z of the 'sequence 
    of 36 characters'. A hyphen is used as it is without substitution 
    (however, in case of 5.2.2.2. and 5.2.2.4 below, assign it to `0-').
    
    5.2.2. Multilingual character

    According to the numbers of characters, multilingual characters 
    are assigned as follows:
    
      5.2.2.1. When the number of characters is above 35 characters 
               and below 1260 characters;
      
      Assign multilingual characters to 10-zz (35x36=1260) of the 
      'sequence of 36 characters' in order. 
      
      5.2.2.2. When the number of characters is above 1260 
               characters and below 1296 characters;

      By attaching the letters using a hyphen from `-0' to`-z' to the
      end of the sequence of `zz', the representation range of two 
      ASCII characters is extended to 1296 multilingual characters.

      5.2.2.3. When the number of characters is above 1296 
               characters and below 45,360 characters;

      Assign multilingual characters to the three digits of '36 
      characters sequence', 100-zzz, in order.

      5.2.2.4. When the number of characters is above 45,360 
               characters and below 47,952 characters;
      
      As stated above in 5.2.2.2, the three ASCII characters using a 
      hyphen, can extend the representation range to 47,952 
      (36x37x36) multilingual characters.

      
  5.3. Characters in the plane besides BMP

  Same as characters in BMP, those characters in other plane of 
  Canonical form are divided according to the language and arranged 
  in '36-characters sequence' independently. Therefore, which plane 
  those characters are located in makes no difference.

The top level domains are limited in numbers (.com, .org, .net,Ì—). 
Thus, instead of a substitute, they are directly translated.



7. Conversion and display

  7.1 Converting multilingual domain names into the traditional ones.

  When a user tries to enter a multilingual domain name into an 
  application to use an Internet service, the conversion program runs 
  by multilingual character(s) included in the domain name. Then, the 
  program converts the multilingual domain name into the traditional 
  one by including the 'multilingual key' and the 'language key' 
  mentioned above, and by replacing each character with its 'character

  substitute', and hands over the converted domain name to the 
  application handling the Internet service.
  
    7.1.1 Example
    
    When, for example, a multilingual domain name composed with Korean, 
    alphabets and digits, 
    "0xb300/0xd55c/0xb9c7/0xad09/ks-23.0xd68c/0xc0ab" 
    or "0xb300/0xd55c/0xb9c7/0xad09/ks-23.com", is entered, 
    the following exemplary result can be given as a model.
       "0xb300/0xd55c/0xb9c/0xad09" are 4 characters of Korean meaning
       Korea. And "0xd68c/0xc0ab" means company. 

    (Assumption): 
    
    The multilingual key is z-, 
    and the language key for Korean is k. 
    
      <Character substitute> 
      
      digits  1-9 ===> 00-09 of 36-characters sequence
      The Korean characters (11,172 characters) correspond to 5.2.2.3 
      above. Therefore, The 11,172 Korean characters at position 
      0xac00-d7a3 (hexadecimal) in the ISO 10646/unicode are arranged 
      in 100-9mb of the 36-characters sequence in the order. 

      0xb300 (the 1,793th from the 0xac00) ===> 
                           It corresponds to "2ds" of the 36 sequence.
      0xd55c (the 10,589th from 0xac00) ===> 
                           It corresponds to "964" of the 36 sequence.
      0xb9c7 (the 3,528th from 0xac00)  ===> 
                           It corresponds to "38z" of the 36 sequence.
      0xad09 (the 366th from 0xac00) ===>  
                           It corresponds to "1a5" of the 36 sequence.


    (Conversion)

    Under user interface: 
    "0xb300/0xd55c/0xb9c7/0xad09/ks-23.0xd68c/0xc0ab" is entered, and 
    it is converted to the traditional name following.

  7.2 Display of multilingual domain name

  When a domain name includes the multilingual key, and the 
  language key in that domain conforms to the language in the text 
  editor, the program converts, (reverse of 7.1), by deleting the 
  multilingual key and language key, and by replacing the rest of the 
  ASCII characters with native characters. 
  And then the multilingual domain name is displayed to the monitor 
  in the native language. 
  But if the domain does not contain a multilingual key, or the 
  language key does not conform to the language in the text editor of 
  the user's computer, the domain name is displayed to the monitor as 
  it is, without any conversion.
  
  
  
8. Different language

When a user logs in another multilingual domain name in a different 
language zone, (e.g., Japanese user tries to log in the Korean domain);
If the user does not have a text editor for its language, he/she types 
and logs in the domain name as it is.
