1.  Introduction

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS)
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture] provides read and write access to the
   information and state within the routing process that exists inside
   the routing elements, this is achieved via protocol message exchange
   between I2RS clients and I2RS agents associated with the routing
   system.  One of the functions of I2RS is to read and write data of
   Routing Information Base (RIB).  [I-D.ietf-i2rs-usecase-reqs-summary]
   introduces a set of RIB use cases.  The RIB information model is
   defined in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

   This document defines a YANG [RFC6020][RFC6991] data model for the
   RIB that satisfies the RIB use cases and aligns with the RIB
   information model.

1.1.  Definitions and Acronyms

   RIB: Routing Information Base

   Information Model (IM): An abstract model of a conceptual domain,
   independent of a specific implementation or data representation.

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is as
   follows:

   o  Brackets "[" and "]" enclose list keys.

   o  Curly braces "{" and "}" contain names of optional features that
      make the corresponding node conditional.

   o  Abbreviations before data node names: "rw" means configuration
      (read-write) and "ro" state data (read-only).

   o  Symbols after data node names: "?" means an optional node and "*"
      denotes a "list" and "leaf-list".

   o  Parentheses enclose choice and case nodes, and case nodes are also
      marked with a colon (":").

   o  Ellipsis ("...") stands for contents of subtrees that are not
      shown.

2.  Model Structure

   The following figure shows an overview of structure tree of the ietf-
   i2rs-rib module.  To give a whole view of the structure tree, some
   details of the tree are omitted.  The relevant details are introduced
   in the subsequent sub-sections.

         Figure 1: Overview of I2RS RIB Module Structure

2.1.  RIB Capability

   RIB capability negotiation is very important because not all of the
   hardware will be able to support all kinds of nexthops and there
   might be a limitation on how many levels of lookup can be practically
   performed.  Therefore, a RIB data model MUST specify a way for an
   external entity to learn about the functional capabilities of a
   network device.

   At the same time, nexthop chains can be used to specify multiple
   headers over a packet, before that particular packet is forwarded.
   Not every network device will be able to support all kinds of nexthop

Internet-Draft                   RIB DM                     January 2017


   chains along with the arbitrary number of headers which are chained
   together.  The RIB data model MUST provide a way to expose the
   nexthop chaining capability supported by a given network device.

   This module uses the feature and if-feature statements to achieve
   above capability advertisement.

2.2.  Routing Instance and Rib

   A routing instance, in the context of the RIB information model, is a
   collection of RIBs, interfaces, and routing protocol parameters.  A
   routing instance creates a logical slice of the router and can allow
   multiple different logical slices, across a set of routers, to
   communicate with each other.  The routing protocol parameters control
   the information available in the RIBs.  More detail about routing
   instance can be found in Section 2.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

   For a routing instance, there can be multiple RIBs.  Therefore, this
   model uses "list" to express the RIBs.  The structure tree is shown
   below:

   +--rw routing-instance
      +--rw name              string
      +--rw interface-list* [name]
      |  +--rw name if:interface-ref
      +--rw router-id?        yang:dotted-quad
      +--rw lookup-limit?     uint8

2.3.  Route

   A route is essentially a match condition and an action following that
   match.  The match condition specifies the kind of route (e.g., IPv4,
   MPLS, MAC, Interface etc.) and the set of fields to match on.

   According to the definition in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model], a
   route MUST associate with the following attributes:

   o  ROUTE_PREFERENCE: See Section 2.3 of
      [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model].

   o  ACTIVE: Indicates whether a route has at least one fully resolved
      nexthop and is therefore eligible for installation in the FIB.

   o  INSTALLED: Indicates whether the route got installed in the FIB.

   In addition, a route can be associated with one or more optional
   route attributes (e.g., route-vendor-attributes).

   A RIB will have a number of routes, so the routes are expressed as a
   list under a specific rib.  Each RIB has its own route list.

2.4.  Nexthop

   A nexthop represents an object resulting from a route lookup.  As
   illustrated in Section 2.4 of [I-D.ietf-i2rs-rib-info-model], to
   support various use cases (e.g., load balance, protection, multicast
   or a combination of them), the nexthop is modeled as a multi-level
   structure and supports recursion.  The first level of the nexthop
   includes the following four types:

   o  Base: The "base" nexthop is the foundation of all other nexthop
      types.  It includes the follow basic nexthops:

      *  nexthop-id

      *  IPv4 address

      *  IPv6 address

      *  egress-interface

      *  egress-interface with IPv4 address

      *  egress-interface with IPv6 address

      *  egress-interface with MAC address

      *  logical-tunnel

      *  tunnel-encap

      *  tunnel-decap

      *  rib-name

   o  Chain: Provide a way to perform multiple operations on a packet by
      logically combining them.

   o  Load-balance: Designed for load-balance case where it normally
      will have multiple weighted nexthops.

   o  Protection: Designed for protection scenario where it normally
      will have primary and standby nexthop.

   o  Replicate: Designed for multiple destinations forwarding.

   The structure tree of nexthop is shown in the following figures.

2.5.  RPC Operations

   This module defines the following RPC operations:

   o  rib-add: Add a RIB to a routing instance.  A name of the rib,
      address family of the RIB and (optionally) whether the RPF check
      is enabled are passed as the input parameters.  The output is the
      result of the add operation:

      *  true - success;

      *  false - failed; when failed, the i2rs agent may return the
         specific reason that causes the failure.

   o  rib-delete: Delete a RIB from a routing instance.  When a RIB is
      deleted, all routes installed in the RIB will be deleted.  A name
      of the RIB is passed as the input parameter.  The output is the
      result of the delete operation:

      *  true - success;

      *  false - failed; when failed, the i2rs agent may return the
         specific reason that causes the failure.

   o  route-add: Add a route or a set of routes to a rib.  A RIB name,
      the route prefix(es), route attributes, route vendor attributes,
      nexthop and whether return failure detail are passed as the input
      parameters.  Before calling the route-add rpc, it is required to
      call the nh-add rpc to create and/or return the nexthop
      identifier.  The output is a combination of the route operation
      states that include:

      *  success-count: the number of routes that were successfully
         added;

Internet-Draft                   RIB DM                     January 2017


      *  failed-count: the number of the routes that failed to be added;

      *  failure-detail: shows the specific routes that failed to be
         added.

   o  route-delete: Delete a route or a set of routes from a rib.  A
      name of the rib, the route prefix(es) and whether to return
      failure detail are passed as the input parameters.  The output is
      a combination of route operation states that include:

      *  success-count: the number of routes that were successfully
         deleted;

      *  failed-count: the number of the routes that failed to be
         deleted;

      *  failure-detail: shows the specific routes that failed to be
         deleted.

   o  route-update: Update a route or a set of routes.  A RIB name, the
      route prefix(es), or route attributes, or route vendor attributes,
      or nexthop are passed as the input parameters.  The match
      conditions can be either route prefix(es), or route attributes, or
      route vendor attributes, or nexthop.  The update actions include:
      update the nexthop, update the route attributes, update the route
      vendor attributes.  The output is combination of the route
      operation states that include:

   o  nh-add: Add a nexthop to a rib.  A name of the RIB and a nexthop
      are passed as the input parameters.  The network node is required
      to allocate a nexthop identifier to the nexthop.  The outputs
      include the result of the nexthop add operation.

      *  true - success; when success, a nexthop identifier will be
         returned to the i2rs client.

      *  false - failed; when failed, the i2rs agent may return the
         specific reason that causes the failure.

2.6.  Notifications

   Asynchronous notifications are sent by the RIB manager of a network
   device to an external entity when some event triggers on the network
   device.  An implementation of this RIB data model MUST support
   sending two kinds of asynchronous notifications.

   1.  Route change notification:

   o Installed (Indicates whether the route got installed in the FIB) ;

   o Active (Indicates whether a route has at least one fully resolved
   nexthop and is therefore eligible for installation in the FIB) ;

   o Reason - E.g.  Not authorized

   2.  Nexthop resolution status notification

   Nexthops can be fully resolved or an unresolved.

   A resolved nexthop has an adequate level of information to send the
   outgoing packet towards the destination by forwarding it on an
   interface to a directly connected neighbor.

   An unresolved nexthop is something that requires the RIB manager to
   determine the final resolved nexthop.  In one example, a nexthop
   could be an IP address.  The RIB manager would resolve how to reach
   that IP address, e.g. by checking if that particular IP address is
   reachable by regular IP forwarding or by a MPLS tunnel or by both.
   If the RIB manager cannot resolve the nexthop, then the nexthop
   remains in an unresolved state and is NOT a suitable candidate for
   installation in the FIB.

   An implementation of this RIB data model MUST support sending route-
   change notifications whenever a route transitions between the
   following states:

   o  from the active state to the inactive state

   o  from the inactive state to the active state

   o  from the installed state to the uninstalled state

   o  from the uninstalled state to the installed state

   A single notification MAY be used when a route transitions from
   inactive/uninstalled to active/installed or in the other direction.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests to register a URI in the "ns" registry with
   the "IETF XML registry" [RFC3688]:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2rs-rib
    Registrant Contact: The IESG.
    XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

   This document requests to register a YANG module in the "YANG Module
   Names registry" [RFC6020]:

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    name:         ietf-i2rs-rib
    namespace:    urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-i2rs-rib
    prefix:       iir
    reference:    RFC XXXX
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

5.  Security Considerations

   I2RS protocol provides read and write access to the information and
   state (e.g., RIB) within the routing process that exists inside the
   routing elements.  These information and state are normally
   considered sensitive or vulnerable.  Improper write operations to
   these information and state can have negative effects on the network.

   The I2RS protocol will provide security mechanisms as required in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-security-environment-reqs] and
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-protocol-security-requirements].

   The YANG data model defined in this document itself does not
   introduce extra security issues.
