1.  Introduction

   Dates and times are used in a very diverse set of internet
   applications, all the way from server-side logging to calendaring and
   scheduling.

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended             December 2021


   Each distinct instant in time can be represented in a descriptive
   text format using a timestamp, and [ISO8601] standardizes a widely-
   adopted timestamp format, which forms the basis of [RFC3339].
   However, this format only allows timestamps to contain very little
   additional relevant information, which means that, beyond that, any
   contextual information related to a given timestamp needs to be
   either handled separately or attached to it in a non-standard manner.

   This is already a pressing issue for applications that handle each
   instant with an associated time zone name, to take into account
   things like DST transitions.  Most of these applications attach the
   timezone to the timestamp in a non-standard format, at least one of
   which is fairly well-adopted [JAVAZDT].  Furthermore, applications
   might want to attach even more information to the timestamp,
   including but not limited to the calendar system it needs to be
   represented in.

1.1.  Scope

   This document defines an extension syntax for timestamps as specified
   in [RFC3339] that has the following properties:

   *  The extension suffix is completely optional, making existing
      [RFC3339] timestamps compatible with this format.

   *  The format is compatible with the pre-existing popular syntax for
      attaching time zone names to timestamps ([JAVAZDT]).

   *  The format provides a generalized way to attach any additional
      information to the timestamp.

   This document does not address extensions to the format where the
   semantic result no longer is a fixed timestamp that is referenced to
   a (past or future) UTC time.  For instance, it does not address:

   *  Future time given as a local time in some specified time zone,
      where changes to the definition of that time zone (e.g., a
      political decision to enact or rescind daylight savings time)
      changes the actual time in UTC time.

   *  Time given as a "floating time", i.e., a local time without
      information as to which time zone this local time refers to.

   *  The use of time scales different from UTC, such as TAI.

   However, the additional information provided that augments a fixed
   timestamp may be sufficient to detect an inconsistency between
   intention and the actual information given in the timestamp, e.g.,



Sharma & Bormann           Expires 6 June 2022                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended             December 2021


   between the additional timezone information given and the timezone
   offset recorded in the timestamp.  For instance, such an
   inconsistency might arise because of:

   *  Political decisions as discussed above, or

   *  errors in the applications producing and consuming such a
      timestamp.

   While the information available is not generally sufficient to
   resolve the inconsistency, it may be used to initiate some out of
   band processing to obtain sufficient information for such a
   resolution.

   In order to address some of the requirements implied here, future
   related specifications might define syntax and semantics of strings
   similar to [RFC3339].  Note that the extension syntax defined in the
   present document is designed in such a way that it can be useful for
   such specifications as well.

1.2.  Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   UTC:  Coordinated Universal Time, as maintained since 1988 by the
      Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) in conjunction
      with leap seconds as announced by the International Earth Rotation
      and Reference Frames Service [IERS].  From 1972 through 1987 UTC
      was maintained entirely by Bureau International de l'Heure (BIH).
      Before 1972 UTC was not generally recognized and civil time was
      determined by individual jurisdictions using different techniques
      for attempting to follow Universal Time based on measuring the
      rotation of the earth.

      UTC is often mistakenly referred to as GMT, an earlier timescale
      UTC was designed to be a useful successor for.

   ABNF:  Augmented Backus-Naur Form, a format used to represent
      permissible strings in a protocol or language, as defined in
      [RFC5234].  The rules defined in Appendix B of [RFC5234] are
      imported implicitly.

   Internet Date/Time Format:  The date/time format defined in section 3
      of this document.

   Timestamp:  This term is used in this document to refer to an
      unambiguous representation of some instant in time.

   Z:  A suffix which, when applied to a time, denotes a UTC offset of
      00:00; often spoken "Zulu" from the ICAO phonetic alphabet
      representation of the letter "Z".

   Time Zone:  A time zone that is included in the Time Zone Database
      (often called tz or zoneinfo) maintained by IANA.

   CLDR:  Common locale data repository [CLDR], a project of the Unicode
      Consortium to provide locale data to applications.

   For more information about time scales, see Appendix E of [RFC1305],
   Section 3 of [ISO8601], and the appropriate ITU documents
   [ITU-R-TF.460-6].

2.  Extended Date/Time format

   This section discusses desirable qualities of formats for the
   timestamp extension suffix and defines such a format that extends
   [RFC3339] for use in Internet protocols.

2.1.  Informative

   The format should allow implementations to specify additional
   important information in addition to the bare timestamp.  This is
   done by defining _tags_, each with a _key_ and a _value_ separated by
   an equals sign.  The key of a tag can be split into two parts by
   including a hyphen/minus sign "-"; the first part (including the "-")
   can then be used as a namespace.  The value of a tag can be a hyphen/
   minus delimited list of multiple values.

   Out of these tags, applications can build an informative _suffix_ at
   the end with as many tags as required.

   Keys are case-sensitive.  Values are case-sensitive unless otherwise
   specified.

   In case a suffix repeats a key or otherwise contains conflicting
   tags, implementations MUST give precedence to whichever value is
   positioned first.
   // I'd rather place a MUST NOT for this case, first.  This definitely
   // needs to be expanded into some general text about error handling.
   //
   // -- --- cabo

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended             December 2021


2.2.  Namespaced

   Suffix keys identify a _namespace_. By including a hyphen/minus sign
   "-", the namespace can be separated from the rest of the key; if no
   hyphen/minus sign is included, the whole key is the namespace.

   For example, if "u-" is a namespace for the Unicode consortium, a
   calendar as defined by that consortium could be included as
   u-ca=<value>.

   An IANA registry for namespaces can be used to allocate namespaces
   for specific applications, as defined in Section 4.  Two namespaces
   are allocated by the present document:

   *  "u-" for keys defined by the Unicode consortium.

   *  "x-" for keys used within experiments.  Such keys are not for
      general interchange and MUST be rejected by a recipient unless
      that is specifically enabled for an experiment.  See [RFC6648] for
      additional considerations about "x-" namespaces.

   *  In addition, for CLDR extensions:
      // I don't know how this would be used, so I can't edit this text.
      //
      // -- --- cabo

      -  There must be a namespace-key and it is restricted to 2
         alphanum characters.

      -  A suffix-value is limited to 3*8alphanum.

   Additional namespaces can be registered under an Expert review
   policy, providing a description for the intended use.  This may be a
   general concept, or a specific organization that is intended to
   register keys within this namespace.

2.3.  Registered

   Actual keys are registered by supplying the information in Figure 1:

                Figure 1: Registration record for a tag key

   'Identifier' contains the key name.

   'Description' contains the name and description of the namespace.

   'Comments' is an OPTIONAL field and MAY contain a broader description
   of the namespace.

   'Added' contains the date the key's definition was published in the
   "date-full" format specified in Figure 2.  For example: 2004-06-28
   represents June 28, 2004, in the Gregorian calendar.

   'RFC' contains the RFC number assigned to the namespace.

   'Authority' contains the name of the maintaining authority for the
   namespace.

   'Contact_Email' contains the email address used to contact the
   maintaining authority.

   'Mailing_List' contains the URL or subscription email address of the
   mailing list used by the maintaining authority.

   'URL' contains the URL of the registry for this namespace.

3.  Syntax Extensions to RFC 3339

3.1.  ABNF

   The following rules extend the ABNF syntax defined in [RFC3339] in
   order to allow the inclusion of an optional suffix.

   The extended date/time format is described by the rule date-time-ext.
   date-time is imported from Section 5.6 of [RFC3339], ALPHA and DIGIT
   from Appendix B.1 of [RFC5234].

Internet-Draft             Timestamps Extended             December 2021


   time-zone-initial = ALPHA / "." / "_"
   time-zone-char    = time-zone-initial / DIGIT / "-" / "+"
   time-zone-part    = time-zone-initial *13(time-zone-char)
                       ; but not "." or ".."
   time-zone-name    = time-zone-part *("/" time-zone-part)
   time-zone         = "[" time-zone-name "]"

   namespace         = 1*alphanum
   namespace-key     = 1*alphanum
   suffix-key        = namespace ["-" namespace-key]

   suffix-value      = 1*alphanum
   suffix-values     = suffix-value *("-" suffix-value)
   suffix-tag        = "[" suffix-key "=" suffix-values "]"
   suffix            = [time-zone] *suffix-tag

   date-time-ext     = date-time suffix

   alphanum          = ALPHA / DIGIT

              Figure 2: ABNF grammar of extensions to RFC 3339

   Note that a time-zone is syntactically similar to a suffix-tag, but
   does not use a suffix-key and an equals sign.  This special case is
   only available for timezone tags.

3.2.  Examples

   Here are some examples of Internet extended date/time format.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00

             Figure 3: RFC 3339 date-time with timezone offset

   Figure 3 represents 39 minutes and 57 seconds after the 16th hour of
   December 19th, 1996 with an offset of -08:00 from UTC.  Note that
   this is the same instant in time as 1996-12-20T00:39:57Z, expressed
   in UTC.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]

                      Figure 4: Adding a timezone name

   Figure 4 represents the exact same instant as the previous example
   but additionally specifies the human time zone associated with it
   ("Pacific Time") for time-zone-aware implementations to take into
   account.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[America/Los_Angeles][u-ca=hebrew]

                Figure 5: Projecting to the Hebrew calendar

   Figure 5 represents the exact same instant, but it informs calendar-
   aware implementations that they should project it to the Hebrew
   calendar.

   1996-12-19T16:39:57-08:00[x-foo=bar][x-baz=bat]

              Figure 6: Adding tags in private use namespaces

   Figure 6, based on Figure 3, utilizes the private use namespace to
   declare two additional pieces of information in the suffix that can
   be interpreted by any compatible implementations and ignored
   otherwise.

4.  IANA Considerations

   Define a registry that can contain both namespaces and keys.
   Namespaces can be recognized by ending with a hyphen/minus.  Actual
   keys do not.  See Section 2.3 for the detailed information (to be
   edited).

   The policy is "RFC required", "Specification Required", ???
   // We need to define the policy for both namespaces and full keys.
   //
   // -- --- cabo[RFC8126].
