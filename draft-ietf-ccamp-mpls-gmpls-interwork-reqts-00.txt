Abstract 
    
   This document describes a framework and Service Provider requirements 
   for operating Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) traffic 
   engineering (TE) networks over Generalized MPLS (GMPLS) networks. 
    
   Operation of an MPLS-TE network as a client network to a GMPLS 
   network has enhanced operational capabilities than provided by a co-
   existent protocol model (ships in the night). 
    
   The GMPLS network may be a packet or a non-packet network, and may 
   itself be a multi-layer network supporting both packet and non-packet 
   technologies. A MPLS-TE Label Switched Path (LSP) originates and 
   terminates on an MPLS Label Switching Router (LSR). The GMPLS network 
   provides transparent transport for the end-to-end MPLS-TE LSP. 
    
   Specification of solutions is out of scope for this document.

1. Introduction 
    
   Multiprotocol Label Switching traffic engineering (MPLS-TE) networks 
   are often deployed over transport networks such that the transport 
   networks provide connectivity between the Label Switching Routers 
   (LSRs) in the MPLS-TE network. Increasingly, these transport networks 
   are operated using a Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching 
   (GMPLS) control plane and label Switched Paths (LSPs) in the GMPLS 
   network provide connectivity in the MPLS-TE network. 
    
   Generalized Multiprotocol Label Switching (GMPLS) protocols were 
   developed as extensions to Multiprotocol Label Switching traffic 
   engineering (MPLS-TE) protocols. MPLS-TE is limited to the control of 
   packet switching networks, but GMPLS can also control sub-packet 
   technologies at layers one and two. 
    
   The GMPLS network may be managed by an operator as a separate network 
   (as it was when it was under management plane control before the use 
   of GMPLS as a control plane), but optimizations of management and 
   operation may be achieved by coordinating the use of the MPLS-TE and 
   GMPLS networks and operating the two networks with a close 
   client/server relationship. 
    
   GMPLS LSP setup may triggered by the signaling of MPLS-TE LSPs in the 
   MPLS-TE network so that the GMPLS network is reactive to the needs of 
   the MPLS-TE network. The triggering process can be under the control 
   of operator policies without needing direct intervention by an 
   operator. 
    
   The client/server configuration just described can also apply in 
   migration scenarios for MPLS-TE packet switching networks that are 
   being migrated to be under GMPLS control. [MIGRATE] describes a 
   migration scenario called the Island Model. In this scenario, groups 
   of nodes (islands) are migrated from the MPLS-TE protocols to the 
   GMPLS protocols and operate entirely surrounded by MPLS-TE nodes (the 
   sea). This scenario can be effectively managed as a client/server 
   network relationship using the framework described in this document. 
    
   In order to correctly manage the dynamic interaction between the MPLS 
   and GMPLS networks, it is necessary to understand the operational 
   requirements and the control that the operator can impose. Although 
   this problem is very similar to the multi-layer networks described in 
   [MLN], it must be noted that those networks operate GMPLS protocols 
   in both the client and server networks which facilitates smoother

   interworking. Where the client network uses MPLS-TE protocols over 
   the GMPLS server network there is a need to study the interworking of 
   the two protocol sets. 
    
   This document examines the protocol requirements for protocol 
   interworking to operate an MPLS-TE network as a client network over a 
   GMPLS server network, and provides a framework for such operations. 
    
2. Reference model 
    
   The reference model used in this document is shown in Figure 1. It 
   can easily be seen that the interworking between MPLS-TE and GMPLS 
   protocols must occur on a node and not on a link. Nodes on the 
   interface between the MPLS-TE and GMPLS networks must be responsible 
   for handling both protocol sets and for providing any protocol 
   interworking that is required. We call these nodes Border Routers.

   MPLS-TE network connectivity is provided through a GMPLS LSP which is 
   created between Border Routers. End-to-end connectivity between MPLS 
   LSRs in the client MPLS-TE networks is provided by an MPLS-TE LSP 
   that is carried across the MPLS-TE network by the GMPLS LSP using 
   hierarchical LSP techniques [RFC4206], LSP stitching segments 
   [STITCH] or a contiguous LSP. LSP stitching segments and contiguous

   LSPs are only available where the GMPLS network is a packet switching 
   network. 
3. Detailed Requirements 
    
   This section describes detailed requirements for MPLS-TE/GMPLS 
   interworking in support of the reference model shown in figure 1. 
    
3.1 End-to-End Signaling 
    
   The solution MUST be able to preserve MPLS signaling information 
   signaled within the MPLS-TE client network at the start of the MPLS-
   TE LSP, and deliver it on the other side of the GMPLS server network 
   for use within the MPLS-TE client network at the end of the MPLS-TE 
   LSP. This may require protocol mapping (and re-mapping), protocol 
   tunneling, or the use of remote protocol adjacencies.  
    
3.2 Triggered Establishment of GMPLS LSPs 
    
   The solution MUST provide the ability to establish end-to-end MPLS- 
   TE LSPs over a GMPLS server network. It SHOULD be possible for GMPLS 
   LSPs across the core network to be set up between Border Routers 
   triggered by the signaling of MPLS-TE LSPs in the client network. 
   GMPLS LSPs MAY also be pre-established as the result of management 
   plane control. 
    
3.3 Diverse Paths for End-to-End MPLS-TE LSPs 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to establish end-to-end 
   MPLS-TE LSPs having diverse paths for protection of the LSP traffic. 
   This means that MPLS-TE LSPs SHOULD be kept diverse both within the 
   client MPLS-TE network and as they cross the server GMPLS network. 
   This means that there SHOULD be a mechanism to request the provision 
   of diverse GMPLS LSPs between a pair of Border Routers to provide 
   protection of the GMPLS span, but also that there SHOULD be a way to 
   keep GMPLS LSPs between different Border Routers disjoint. 
    
3.4 Advertisement of MPLS-TE Information via the GMPLS Network 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to advertise of TE 
   information from MPLS-TE client networks across the GMPLS server 
   network. 
   The advertisement of TE information from within an MPLS-TE client 
   network to all LSRs in the client network enables a head end LSR to 
   compute an optimal path for an LSP to a tail end LSR that is reached 
   over the GMPLS server network. 
   Where there is more than one client MPLS-TE network, the TE 
   information from separate MPLS-TE networks MUST be kept private, 
   confidential and secure.

        draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-00 December 2006 
 
 
3.5 Selective Advertisement of MPLS-TE Information via a Border Node 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide the ability to distribute TE reachability 
   information from the GMPLS server network to MPLS-TE networks 
   selectively. This information is useful for the LSRs in the MPLS-TE 
   networks to compute paths that cross the GMPLS server network and to 
   select the correct Border Routers to provide connectivity. 
    
   The solution MUST NOT distribute TE information from within a non-PSC 
   GMPLS server network to any client MPLS-TE network as that 
   information may cause confusion and selection of inappropriate paths. 
    
3.6 Interworking of MPLS-TE and GMPLS protection 
    
   If an MPLS-TE LSPs is protected using MPLS Fast Reroute (FRR) 
   [RFC4090], then similar PROTECTION MUST be provided over the GMPLS 
   island. Operator and policy controls SHOULD be made available at the 
   Border Router to determine how suitable protection is provided in the 
   GMPLS island. 
    
3.7 Independent Failure Recovery and Reoptimization 
    
   The solution SHOULD provide failure recovery and reoptimization in 
   the GMPLS server network without impacting MPLS-TE client network and 
   vice versa. That is, it SHOULD be possible to recover from a fault 
   within the GMPLS island or to reoptimize the path across the GMPLS 
   island without requiring signaling activity within the MPLS-TE client 
   network. Similarly, it SHOULD be possible to perform recovery or 
   reoptimization within the MPLS-TE client network without requiring 
   signaling activity within the GMPLS server networks. 
    
   In case that failure in the GMPLS server network can not be repaired 
   transparently, some kind of notification of the failure SHOULD be 
   transmitted to MPLS-TE network.   
    
3.8 Complexity and Risks 
    
   The solution SHOULD NOT introduce unnecessary complexity to the 
   current operating network to such a degree that it would affect the 
   stability and diminish the benefits of deploying such a solution in 
   service provider networks. 
    
3.9 Scalability consideration 
    
   The solution MUST scale well with consideration to at least the 
   following considerations. 
    
   - The number of GMPLS-capable nodes (i.e., the size of the GMPLS 
   server network). 
 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.          Expires June, 2007                  [Page 6] 
        draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-00 December 2006 
 
 
   - The number of MPLS-TE-capable nodes (i.e., the size of the MPLS-TE 
   client network). 
   - The number of MPLS-TE client networks. 
   - The number of GMPLS LSPs. 
   - The number of MPLS-TE LSPs. 
    
3.10 Performance Consideration 
    
   The solution SHOULD be evaluated with regard to the following 
   criteria. 
    
   - Failure and restoration time. 
   - Impact and scalability of the control plane due to added 
     overheads. 
   - Impact and scalability of the data/forwarding plane due to added 
     overheads. 
    
3.11 Management Considerations 
    
   Manageability of deployment of an MPLS-TE client network over GMPLS 
   server network MUST addresses the following considerations. 
    
   - Need for coordination of MIB modules used for control plane 
   management and monitoring in the client and server networks. 
   - Need for diagnostic tools that can discover and isolate faults 
   across the border between the MPLS-TE client and GMPLS server 
   networks. 
    
4. Security Considerations   
    
   We will write security considerations in next version. 
    
5. Recommended Solution Architecture 
    
   The recommended solution architecture to meet the requirements set 
   out in the previous sections is known as the Border Peer Model. This 
   architecture is a variant of the Augmented Model described in 
   [RFC3945]. The remainder of this document presents an overview of 
   this architecture. Details of protocol solutions are described in 
   [BORDER-PEER]. 
    
   In the Augmented Model, routing information from the lower layer 
   (server) network is filtered at the interface to the higher layer 
   (client) network and is distributed within the higher layer network. 
   In the Border Peer Model, the interface between the client and server 
   networks is the Border Router. This router has visibility of the 
   routing information in the server network yet also participates as a 
   peer in the client network. However, the Border Router does not 
   distribute server routing information into the client network. 
 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.          Expires June, 2007                  [Page 7] 
        draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-00 December 2006 
 
 
    
   The Border Peer Model may also be contrasted with the Overlay Model 
   [RFC3945]. In this model there is a protocol request/response 
   interface (the user network interface - UNI) between the client and 
   server networks. [RFC4208] shows how this interface may be supported 
   by GMPLS protocols operated between client edge and server edge 
   routers while retaining the routing information within the server 
   network. The Border Peer Model can be viewed as placing the UNI 
   within the Border Router thus giving the Border Router peer 
   capabilities in both the client and server network. 
    
5.1 Use of Contiguous, Hierarchical, and Stitched LSPs 
    
   All three LSP types MAY be supported in the Border Peer Model, but 
   contiguous LSPs are the hardest to support because they require 
   protocol mapping between the MPLS-TE client network and the GMPLS 
   server network. Such protocol mapping can currently be achieved since 
   MPLS-TE signaling protocols are a subset of GMPLS, but this mechanism 
   is not future-proofed. 
    
   Contiguous and stitched LSPs can only be supported where the GMPLS 
   server network has the same switching type (that is, packet 
   switching) as the MPLS-TE network. Requirements for independent 
   failure recovery within the GMPLS island require the use of loose 
   path reoptimization techniques [LOOSE-REOPT] and end-to-end make-
   before-break [RFC3209] which will not provide rapid recovery. 
    
   For these reasons, the use of hierarchical LSPs across the server 
   network is RECOMMENDED for the Border Peer Model, but see the 
   discussion of Fast Reroute protection in section 5.3. 
    
5.2 MPLS-TE Control Plane Connectivity 
    
   Control plane connectivity between MPLS-TE LSRs connected by a GMPLS 
   island in the Border Peer Model MAY be provided by the control 
   channels of the GMPLS network. If this is done, a tunneling mechanism 
   (such as GRE [RFC2784]) SHOULD be used to ensure that MPLS-TE 
   information is not consumed by the GMPLS LSRs. But care is required 
   to avoid swamping the control plane of the GMPLS network with MPLS-TE 
   control plane (particularly routing) messages. 
    
   In order to ensure scalability, control plane messages for the MPLS-
   TE client network MAY be carried between Border Routers in a single 
   hop MPLS-TE LSP routed through the data plane of the GMPLS server 
   network. 
    
5.3 Fast Reroute Protection 
    

 
 
K.Kumaki, et al.          Expires June, 2007                  [Page 8] 
        draft-ietf-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-reqts-00 December 2006 
 
 
   If the GMPLS network is packet switching, Fast Reroute protection can 
   be offered on all hops of a contiguous LSP. If the GMPLS network is 
   packet switching then all hops of a hierarchical GMPLS LSP or GMPLS 
   stitching segment can be protected using Fast Reroute. If the end-to-
   end MPLS-TE LSP requests Fast Reroute protection, the GMPLS packet 
   switching network SHOULD provide such protection. 
    
   However, note that it is not possible to provide FRR node protection 
   of the upstream Border Router without careful consideration of 
   available paths, and protection of the downstream Border Router is 
   not possible where hierarchical LSPs or stitching segments are used. 
    
   Note further that Fast Reroute is not available in non-packet 
   technologies. However, other protection techniques are supported by 
   GMPLS for non-packet networks and are likely to provide similar 
   levels of protection. 
    
   The limitations of FRR need careful consideration by the operator and 
   may lead to the decision to provide end-to-end protection for the 
   MPLS-TE LSP.
