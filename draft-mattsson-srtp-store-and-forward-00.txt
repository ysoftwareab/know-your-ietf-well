Abstract

   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) transforms were
   designed to allow simple and efficient protection of RTP.  To provide
   this, encryption and authenticity of media and control signaling are
   tightly coupled to the RTP session, and to the information in the RTP
   header.  Hence, it is not possible to perform store and forward of
   protected media.

   This document gives, based on a use case analysis, requirements that

   new SRTP transforms need to satisfy in order to allow independent
   media and transport protection.  A first proposal on how to implement
   such transforms in SRTP is also presented.

1.  Introduction

   The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711] is a profile
   of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550], which provides
   confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection to
   both RTP and RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol).

   SRTP is designed with the assumption that each participant in the
   SRTP session is equally trusted.  This implies that all participants
   in the SRTP session have access to all keying material needed to
   encrypt/decrypt and authenticate the media.  It is well known that
   this model does not apply to all real-world use cases.  In particular
   the presence of middle boxes that are not trusted with access to
   cleartext media, but need to manipulate e.g. the RTP headers, poses a
   problem.

   This document describes a couple of use cases focused on streaming
   media where at least one of the participants does not have access to
   all the keying material.  The main use case used to derive
   requirements is an answering machine that is storing encrypted media
   and later forwarding it to clients.  This use case is selected as it
   seems to require the most from a functional point of view even though
   other media store and forward applications might be of greater
   practical importance.  One important use case is a non-trusted server
   streaming pre-encrypted media.  As the SRTP was not designed with
   such a use case in mind, SRTP cannot readily be used.  Other methods
   like the Packet-switched Streaming Service (PSS) [3GPP.26.234] exist,
   but are part of larger frameworks tailored for very specific
   situations.  It would however be desirable to be able to use SRTP as
   a general lightweight mechanism in many of these cases.  To achieve
   this, SRTP needs enhancements that support the use cases in an
   efficient and coherent way.  This draft lists a number of
   requirements for these use cases, and based on these requirements, a
   brief solution outline is given.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Definitions of terms and notation will, unless otherwise indicated,
   be as defined in [RFC3711].

   The term authentication will be used to denote message authentication
   and message integrity protection.

   By RTP transport protection or simply transport protection, we mean
   protection (confidentiality, authentication, etc.) of streamed RTP
   packets.  This is provided by SRTP according to [RFC3711].

   By media protection, we similarly mean protection of the application
   payloads carried in RTP.  SRTP provides media protection, but only
   during transport (see above).


3.  Use Cases

   The following use cases were chosen to illustrate media streaming
   scenarios where the current SRTP specification [RFC3711] does not
   provide sufficient functionality.  These use cases provide context
   and general rationale for the requirements presented in Section 4.

3.1.  Trust Model and Assumptions

   The trust model that is addressed in this document includes two
   parties who wish to communicate securely via one or more honest but
   curious middle-boxes.  This means that the communicating parties
   trust the middle-box to deliver the media as expected, but they do
   not trust it with cleartext data.  As can be seen from the use cases
   below there is no example of multiple middle-boxes, but it is a
   natural generalization and it seems warranted to cover this case as
   well.

3.2.  Use Case: Answering Machine

3.2.1.  Storing/Caching Encrypted Media

   Operators commonly provide an answering machine service to their
   customers.  In this case the communicating parties (the caller and
   the callee) may not wish to disclose the media to any other party,
   and hence want to apply encryption between each other.  This requires
   that they are able to establish a shared key; how that is
   accomplished is out of scope for this document.  The answering
   machine acts as a store and forward middle-box, which has to store
   encrypted data and re-transmit it to the callee.  The answering
   machine, acting as a streaming server when sending the data to the
   callee, will not use the exact same RTP headers on the outgoing SRTP
   traffic as was used on the incoming SRTP traffic.  SRTP as specified
   in [RFC3711] will not work in this case, since parts of the RTP
   header is input to the encryption/authentication transforms.

Internet-Draft           SRTP Store and Forward                July 2008


3.2.2.  Transport Protection

   To avoid that the answering machine is filled up with bogus data, it
   is still necessary for the answering machine to authenticate the
   sender of the traffic, and further, to verify the authenticity of the
   incoming traffic.  This poses a problem for SRTP as of [RFC3711] in
   that the message authentication requires a session key shared with
   the answering machine, but the encryption key shall as discussed
   above not be available to it.

   When the callee retrieves the media from the answering machine,
   message authentication is also beneficial.  There are two
   possibilities.  Since the answering machine is trusted not to
   actively behave maliciously, it may be sufficient to provide message
   authentication between the answering machine and the callee.  Also
   here it would be necessary to have a separation between the
   encryption key and authentication key.  The second option is that
   authentication is applied from the caller to the callee.  But if the
   authentication is applied in that way, the answering machine will not
   be able to verify the integrity of the incoming traffic from the
   caller.  It is of course also possible that message authentication is
   desired for any combination of endpoints, i.e. between the caller and
   the callee, between the caller and the answering machine, and between
   the answering machine and the callee.

   Again, how the key management is handled is out of scope for this
   document.

3.2.3.  Playback of Media Stream

   When a user listens to the messages stored on the answering machine,
   it is useful to be able to rewind and/or fast forward in the media
   stream.  For SRTP as of [RFC3711] this is not possible.  The reason
   for that is that even if the same payloads can be re-inserted in the
   stream by the answering machine, the RTP sequence number is steadily
   increasing on a per packet basis.  Since the synchronization of the
   encryption transforms is based on the RTP sequence number, the
   decryption will fail.  In addition, message authentication (no matter
   which option described in Section 3.2.2 is used), will fail since the
   authentication according to [RFC3711] shall cover the header of the
   RTP packet.

3.2.4.  Multiple Callers

   Several messages may be left on the answering machine, received in
   different sessions and possibly from different callers.  The result
   of this is that different keys were used to encrypt the media.
   Depending on how the callee retrieves the messages from the answering

Internet-Draft           SRTP Store and Forward                July 2008


   machine, different options are possible.  One option is to retrieve
   each message as a separate stream, and in this case a separate
   session is required per message.  Another option is to somehow switch
   security contexts midstream.

3.3.  Use Case: Centralized Conferencing

   Another use case is a conference bridge that is not to be trusted
   with the cleartext media.  In this case the conference bridge cannot
   act as a mixer, but in some cases this may be a reasonable
   assumption.  An example is Push-To-Talk solutions, where only one
   user at a time is allowed to talk.  In this setting, the media may be
   re-packaged by the conferencing server into RTP packets with
   different headers compared to the incoming traffic.  As described in
   Section 3.2, this causes authentication and decryption to fail in
   SRTP.


4.  Analysis and Requirements

   There are thus a number of issues with the current SRTP when it comes
   to its use in store and forward applications:

   o  All current SRTP transforms use the RTP header as input.  AES-CTR
      uses the SSRC and the packet index to calculate the IV
      (Initialization Vector), AES-f8 uses even more header parameters,
      and HMAC-SHA1 authenticates the full RTP header.  The SSRC is
      typically determined by the key management protocol and the packet
      index includes the RTP sequence number, which is randomly chosen
      by RTP [RFC3550].  This means that it is impossible to retransmit
      protected packets in a standard compliant way.

   o  Even if SSRC and the SRTP index could be determined beforehand,
      allowing a client to randomly seek in a stream without
      renegotiation would lead to misalignment between the packet index
      used when streaming and the one used during pre-encryption.  If
      the user jumps to a different part of the stream, it is impossible
      to continue increasing the RTP sequence number stepwise while at
      the same time keeping it equal to the sequence number needed for
      decryption.  Jumping backward (e.g. media rewind) would cause even
      more problems as the retransmitted packets would be discarded by
      the SRTP replay protection.

   o  Both the encryption key and the authentication key are derived
      from the same master key in SRTP, see Figure 1.  A client able to
      derive the authentication keys must have access to the master key,
      and can therefore also derive the decryption keys.

4.1.  Requirements

   Based on the use cases and the analysis above, the required
   enhancements needed to support the use cases in an efficient way are:

   o  Transport independent media protection

      To allow retransmission of received protected media, a transform
      that is independent of RTP transport parameters is needed.  The
      media protection MUST cover both message authentication and
      confidentiality protection.

   o  Support of playback of protected media streams

      A client SHALL be able to rewind, fast forward or jump to any
      point in a protected media stream.

      Note that as playback functions like retransmission and random
      seek capability is features in the described use cases; replay
      protection can not be required for transport independent media
      protection.  The option to simply disable authentication all
      together is not an attractive solution.  It SHOULD be possible
      provide (source) authentication of the media stream.

   o  Transport protection

      It SHALL be possible to provide transport protection which is
      independent of the media protection.  The transport protection
      MUST be able to provide confidentiality, authentication, and
      replay protection for RTP and at least authentication and replay
      protection for RTCP.  This requirement maps well against the SRTP
      as of [RFC3711].  Transport protection is also a means to provide
      replay protection of the media.

Internet-Draft           SRTP Store and Forward                July 2008


   o  Separation of security contexts

      It MUST be possible to have independent security contexts for the
      transport independent media protection and the transport
      protection.

   o  Change of transport independent media protection security context

      To allow multiplexing of protected media "clips" using different
      transport independent media protection security contexts into a
      single media stream, it MUST be possible to signal to the receiver
      the security context to use.


5.  Solution Proposal

   The stated requirements above seem possible to meet with two proposed
   additions to SRTP.  Both address the issue of the current SRTP
   transforms' dependence on the RTP packet header.

   As mentioned, in SRTP [RFC3711] the RTP header is used in IV
   formation for encryption/decryption and the authentication transform
   protects the entire packet from modification, creating a
   cryptographic "binding" between payload and RTP header; without the
   original RTP header, the payload itself cannot be authenticated.
   When SRTP transport protection is applied hop-by-hop (hbh), this
   implies problems to simultaneously protect the payload end-to-end
   (e2e), e.g. in the scenarios above, and to provide protection (e.g.
   authentication) for each hop.

   The first proposed addition is therefore a new encryption and
   authentication transform similar to the current AES-CTR/HMAC
   transforms, but with different IV formation and coverage.  As a side
   effect of this new transform, a new key derivation transform is also
   needed.  We also discuss how other components such as replay
   protection would work.

   Before discussing these transforms, however, we discuss how to
   implement the trust model above, which is very much about access to
   keys, i.e. a key management issue.

5.1.  SRTP Cryptographic Contexts

   SRTP maintains a cryptographic context, containing master key(s),
   cryptographic transforms, etc., for the associated SRTP session.
   Exactly how the parameters in the cryptographic context are agreed is
   out of scope of SRTP and is a key management issue.  SRTP assumes
   that a cryptographic context or rather the master key therein is



Blom, et al.             Expires January 8, 2009                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft           SRTP Store and Forward                July 2008


   shared only between mutually trusted parties.

   The SRTP cryptographic context concept is reusable for the use cases
   above.  Conceptually, two mutually trusted parties can share an "e2e
   context".  Between an endpoint and an intermediary (or between two
   intermediaries) a "hbh context" is similarly assumed.  The
   requirement to implement the trust model of the use cases above is
   that the master key(s) in any e2e context MUST be independent and
   MUST NOT be possible to deduce from the master key of any hbh
   context.  The key management protocol used MUST therefore be able to
   negotiate keys satisfying these requirements.

   This means that the sender will use two cryptographic contexts: an
   e2e context used for payload protection to the end-receiver, and, a
   hbh context used to secure the SRTP transport to the (first)
   intermediary.  Similarly, the end-receiver will use two contexts.  An
   intermediary node however, will only use one standard SRTP context.
   In other words, an e2e context is used to achieve media protection as
   required in Section 4, and a hbh context similarly is used to achieve
   transport protection.

   For both e2e and hbh contexts, it is assumed that SRTP cryptographic
   context parameters, such as master key and salt are included.  From
   these, SRTP session keys/salts are derived similarly to [RFC3711]
   (see also below).

   Note that it would be possible to avoid dual SRTP contexts by instead
   using distinct master keys for encryption and authentication; this
   would allow encryption e2e and authentication hbh in the above trust
   model.  However, since it may also be desirable to be able to encrypt
   hbh, it appears more flexible to use distinct contexts.  Other
   aspects such as replay protection (see below) also speak in favor of
   using "standard", but dual SRTP contexts, rather than extending the
   SRTP context definition itself.

                          ^                        ^
                          |                        |
                          +- transport protection -+

   If several senders' payloads are multiplexed within the same SRTP
   stream from a server to a receiver (as discussed in Section 3.2.4)
   there may be need for the receiver to switch between e2e contexts in
   "midstream".  This seems possible to implement using the SRTP MKI
   field which signals which key(s) to use.  The hbh context would,
   however, not be affected by the change in the MKI field.

5.2.  New Transforms

   We present the new transform as an authenticated encryption mode for
   transport independent media protection.  That is, both
   confidentiality and authenticity are provided by the same transform.
   If for some reason these security services are needed independently,
   it is easy to see how to separate the encryption part from the
   authentication part and handle them as separate transforms.

5.2.1.  Encryption Part

   The new encryption transform may for instance use AES in counter
   mode.  (This would enable reuse of parts of already existing SRTP
   implementations.)  However, the new transform derives the IV in a
   different way than the current AES-CTR transform [RFC3711].

   The 128-bit IV is proposed to be constructed from the session salt, a
   nonce (signaled out of band before the streaming begins), and an IV
   sequence number (IVSN), included in each SRTP packet.  The nonce is
   added to replace the SSRC that guaranteed stream-uniqueness of the
   IV, and the IVSN replace the packet index that guaranteed packet-
   uniqueness.

                    Figure 3: New encryption transform

   The IVSN increases by one for each encrypted packet and is
   concatenated to the encrypted payload and the SRTP payload would
   therefore be larger than the RTP payload.  See Figure 3.  The choice
   of the function f should be decided by futher study.

   Note that although the IVSN is not encrypted, it is conceptually
   considered part of the output of the new transform, i.e. part of the
   "Encrypted portion".

   On the receiver side, the IVSN is extracted from the received packet
   and is used to retrieve the original RTP Payload in the obvious way.

5.2.2.  Authentication Part

   The new authentication transform may for instance be based on HMAC-
   SHA1 just as the default authentication transform of [RFC3711] is.
   The main difference is that it only covers the "Encrypted portion"
   including the IVSN, see Figure 3, but not the RTP header.  Another
   difference is that no explicit replay protection is provided by this
   transform.  Figure 4 shows the format.

   The RTP header and optionally a MKI is then added before the packet
   is further processed and transmitted.

   The order (applying authentication after encryption) is proposed to
   agree with current SRTP and best common practice (limit of DoS

   effects etc).

   The processing on the receiving side is not discussed, but is
   straight forward.

   A new identifier for the above authenticated encryption transform is
   needed.  In the sequel we simply denote it T_e2e (end-to-end
   transform).

5.2.3.  Replay Protection

   When the RTP data is also hbh transport protected by SRTP between
   server and receiver, replay protection on the transport level is
   provided.  As mentioned, it is assumed that the server is trusted not
   to attempt replay of data on media level, unless the user requests it
   and thus, this is in line with the trust model.

5.3.  Key Derivation

   Session key derivation (and optional key refresh) for the hbh context
   is performed as in [RFC3711] and is based on SRTP 48-bit index.

   When deriving keys for the T_e2e transform, the IVSN SHALL be used
   instead of the SRTP index.  In practice, this means that we have
   defined a new key derivation transform to be used for the e2e
   context.


6.  Example Usage

   Suppose that a sender, S, wants to send information to a receiver, R,
   via an intermediary, M.

   1.  S agrees with R on an e2e context.  The context has a master key,
       k_e2e, and is configured to use the new transforms described in
       Section 5.  How this is done/signaled (which key management
       protocol to use etc.) is out of scope.  It could be done using
       e.g.  MIKEY [RFC3830].

   2.  S sets up an SRTP session with M to have data forwarded to R. A
       hbh context containing a key, k_hbh, is (somehow) agreed between
       S and M. The context is assumed configured to use HMAC (standard
       HMAC-SHA1 as in [RFC3711]) for transport authentication and, say,
       NULL encryption.

   3.  S starts to transmit SRTP towards M, in effect using T_e2e and
       k_e2e for encryption and k_hbh for authentication.  (The result
       of this is that the payload will be SRTP e2e protected both for

       authenticity and confidentiality, whereas the entire SRTP-packet
       will hbh transport protected for authenticity between S and M.)

   4.  M, recognizing that it is an intermediary for S<->R (i.e. due to
       out-of-band signaling or from the fact that it does not have
       access to the e2e context/key) verifies authenticity of each SRTP
       packet, but does not decrypt the payloads, and just stores them
       for later use.

   5.  At some later time, R sets up an session with M, using SRTP with
       NULL encryption and standard HMAC for transport protection.  A
       second context/key, k_hbh', is agreed/used.

   6.  M uses SRTP with HMAC and k_hbh' to transmit authenticated data
       to R.

   7.  When receiving SRTP packets, R verifies transport authenticity
       using HMAC and k_hbh'.  R then uses T_e2e with k_e2e to process
       the payload part.


7.  Implications on SRTP

   As the SRTP specification allows new transforms, the new transforms
   can be added without any implications.

   The handling of dual security contexts (in the end-points) is however
   a new feature.


8.  Security Considerations

8.1.  Encryption Transform

   Any fixed keystream output, generated from the same inputs (i.e. key
   and IV) MUST only be used to encrypt once.  Reusing such a keystream
   (commonly called a "two-time pad") would almost certainly compromise
   security.

   The new encryption transforms accomplish packet-uniqueness by
   including the IVSN and stream-uniqueness by inclusion of a nonce.
   Thus, the nonce MUST be unique between all the RTP streams within the
   same RTP session that share the same master key.  Master keys MAY be
   shared between streams belonging to the same RTP session, but it is
   RECOMMENDED that each stream have its own master key.

   With these conditions fulfilled the security level should be equal to
   that of [RFC3711].

8.2.  Replay Protection

   Replay protection is only provided on hbh basis, which means that a
   malicious server could "initiate" rewind without the user having
   requested it.  However, this threat falls outside the assumed trust
   model.

   Another case when retransmission on e2e level seems needed is for the
   "answering machine" type of applications where users often go back
   and listen to the same message several times, without re-initiating
   the connection.

10.  IANA Considerations

   To signal that the new transforms are used, each relevant key
   management protocol needs to register the new transforms including
   numbering scheme and syntax with IANA.
