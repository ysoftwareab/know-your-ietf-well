Internet Draft                SIP Conference                April 2004


1. Introduction

   This document builds upon the conferencing requirements specified in
   [4] and explains the mechanism to initiate, modify and teardown 
   conference. It also describes a mechanism to add,remove and modify 
   one or more participants To/From the SIP conference.
   
2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", 
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
   "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
   described in BCP 14, RFC 2119 [1] and indicate requirement levels
   for compliant implementations.

3. Overview of conference mechanism

   In a SIP based voice conference the SIP User Agent which intends to 
   initiate a conference becomes the Initiator of the conference.  The 
   initiator of the conference has some exclusive privileges over the 
   conference session.
   - Initiator can add participants to the conference session.
   - Initiator can modify the mode of the existing participants.
   - Initiator can remove the participants from the conference session.  
   - Initiator can close the conference session.

   Note: The Initiator maps to focus-owner as defined in [4].


4. Motivation for new Method and Header

  The INVITE method of SIP [2] protocol helps in establishing 
  voice calls between SIP user agents. Also the SIP INFO [3] helps 
  in carrying application level information along the SIP signaling
  path during a SIP Session and SIP Method MESSAGE [8]sends an 
  instant message to remote UA. Neither of these methods fulfill 
  the requirement of conveying SIP Client's intention of initiating 
  multiparty SIP session. Hence INITIATE method been introduced.

  Also there is no SIP header through which a list of URIs can be 
  provided to the server. So the Confer-To header is introduced.

  The INITIATE request does not establish any session nor carries 
  any media information.  It conveys the users intention to start
  the conference session with the list of participants mentioned 
  in the Confer-To header.

4.1 The INITIATE Method
  
    INITIATE is a SIP method as defined by RFC 3261 . The INITIATE 
    method indicates that the initiator (identified by From URL) intends
    to initiate a session (Conferencing) with the server. 
    INITIATE method follows the semantics of the Subscribe/Notify 
    mechanism as defined in [9].
   
4.2 ABNF Definition of INITIATE Method

    The semantics of the INITIATE method are described as follows. This
    extension adds another value to the Method BNF described in RFC3261.

	INITIATEm = %x49.4E.49.54.49.41.54.45; INITIATE in caps
	Method   = INVITEm / ACKm / OPTIONSm / BYEm
	          / CANCELm / REGISTERm / UPDATEm 
	         / INITIATEm / extension-method.

    Table 1 extends Table 2 of RFC 3261 for the INITIATE method.

    Table 2 extends Table 3 of RFC 3261 for the INITIATE method.

4.3 Confer-To Header

    This header indicates to the Proxy or Conference server the list 
    of participants, which need to be added to the conference. Only 
    a single Confer-To header field value SHOULD be present in the 
    INITIATE request. Along with the participants URI, this header
    contains an Action paramater which indicates the action to be 
    taken for the URI. The default action paramater will be "ADD".

        The Confer-To header follows the Route header syntax defined 
        in [2]. The Confer-To header specifies the set of users with 
        which the caller wants to initiate a session.

    Header field    where   proxy   INITIATE
    ------------    -----   -----   --------
    Confer-To          R               M

    The following syntax specification uses the augmented Backus-Naur
    Form (BNF) as described in RFC-2234.

     Confer-To = "Confer-To" HCOLON ConferTo-Param
                 * (COMMA ConferTo-Param)
     ConferTo-Param = name-addr *( SEMI confer-to-params )
     confer-to-params = action-param / generic-param
     action-param = "action" EQUAL ("add" / "hold" /  "remove")



      E,g  Confer-To: sip:sreeram@wipro.com;action=add, 
                      sip:nataraju@wipro.com;action=hold

4.4 Action Parameter in Refer-to

    This draft extends the Refer-to header field. In particular,
    it allows  the Refer-to header field parameters to include
    action-param. as defined in section 4.3.

5. Usage Examples
 
   The user who intends to initiate a conference becomes the initiator
   and sends INITIATE request to the conference server with the list of
   participants in Confer-To header. 
   The call flow for this scenario is depicted in Figure 5.1
 
   On receiving INITIATE request, the conference server sends INVITE 
   to all the users listed in the Confer-To header. The server sends 
   notifications as  described in section 3.6 of [7].
 
   On receiving INVITE the UAs (participants) send 200 OK to join the
   conference or a failure response to reject the conference 
   invitation. The server on receiving Responses from the participants
   sends notification using NOTIFY to the initiator.
 
   For more details on frequency of notifications and how they are sent
   refer sections 3.2 and 3.4 of [7].

 6. Actions In Conference
 
 6.1 Adding Users to Conference

     When the initiator wants to add a new user to the conference, he 
     sends a REFER to the Conference server with Refer-To header 
     containing the URI of the new participant and action parameter 
     with value as æaddÆ. The server then reads the Refer-To header and
     action parameter and if the value is æaddÆ sends INVITE with SDP
     [6] parameter a=sendrecv to indicate that the user to be added. 
     The participant upon receiving the INVITE sends 200 OK to join 
     the conference to send and receive the media. The server on 
     receiving the 200 OK, sends NOTIFY to the initiator indicating 
     the joining of new participant.

     In the call flow depicted below, the initiator (UA1) is adding 
     another participants' UA4 to conference.
