Abstract
   This document describes the management of the mobility events
   considered in SPIRITS protocol and the definition of their related
   parameters.

   The mobility events management will allow a SPIRITS server to
   subscribe to and to be notified of location changes of a mobile
   user. The events would only be applicable to mobile users reachable
   through a CS network. The sending of these events must be allowed by
   setting the related marks in the HLR. Besides, the SPIRITS protocol
   must be able to translate the CAMEL operations involving mobility
   information into events that can be transferred to the SPIRITS
   client.

1. INTRODUCTION
   The mobility events management will allow a SPIRITS server to
   subscribe to and to be notified of location changes of a mobile
   user. The events would only be applicable to mobile users reachable
   through a CS network. The sending of these events must be allowed by
   setting the related marks in the HLR. Besides, the SPIRITS protocol
   must be able to translate the CAMEL operations involving mobility
   information into events that can be transferred to the SPIRITS
   client.

   The inclusion of mobility events into SPIRITS protocol provides user
   location information and allows the smart use of mobile phones in
   services like Internet Call Waiting.


2. LIST OF MOBILITY EVENTS
   The events considered in this document are:

   - Location Update in the same VLR service area
   - Location Update in another VLR service area
   - IMSI attach
   - MS initiated IMSI detach
   - Network initiated IMSI detach

                Mobility Events Management in SPIRITS      April 2002


   Every time a mobility event occurs, the subscribed SPIRITS servers
   will be notified about it, and they will receive the following
   information elements:

   - Event type. This IE indicates the type of Mobility Management that
   lead to the notification
   - Basic MSISDN of the mobile user. This IE identifies the mobile
   subscriber to whom the Mobility Event applies.
   - Location information. This IE indicates the current location of
   the MS.

   The first two parameters will be mandatory, and the last one will be
   optional, depending on the network capabilities.


3. LOCATION INFORMATION DESCRIPTION
   The Location information provided to the SPIRITS client would be
   very different depending on the mobile network capabilities, as not
   all the networks are able to supply detailed location information
   about its users. Therefore all the possible information elements
   considered into the location information must be marked as optional,
   and each network will try to make available as much information as
   possible.

   The compound information element Location information consists of
   the following subordinate information elements, all of them
   optional:

   - Location number
   This parameter is used to convey the geographical area address for
   mobility services. It is used when the calling Party Number does not
   contain any information about the geographical location of the
   calling party (for example, origin dependent routing when the
   calling party is a mobile subscriber). It can be present if the
   wireless network VLR can derive it from the stored service area
   identity (for UMTS) or cell global identity (for GSM) or location
   area identity; otherwise shall be absent. The mapping from service
   area identity or cell ID and location area to location number is
   network-specific, and the format is left open to final
   implementations. For a definition of this information element, see
   [1].

   - Cell Id or Location Area ID
   Location area identity or Cell global identity of the cell in which
   the mobile user is currently in radio contact or in which the mobile
   user was last in radio contact. Will be present if the mobile user
   uses radio access and the subscriber record is marked as confirmed
   by radio contact; otherwise shall be absent.

                Mobility Events Management in SPIRITS      April 2002


   - Geographical information
   Will be present if the VLR can derive it from the stored cell global
   identity or location area identity; otherwise shall be absent (for a
   definition of this information element, see 3G TS 23.032).

   - Geodetic information
   Can be present if the VLR can derive it from the stored cell global
   identity or location area identity; otherwise shall be absent. (This
   information element corresponds to the Calling Geodetic Location
   defined in ITU-T Q.763).

   - Age of location information
   This parameter represents the elapsed time in minutes since the last
   network contact with the mobile user (i.e. the actuality of the
   location information). Will be present if available in the MSC/VLR;
   otherwise shall be absent.

   - Selected LSA Identity
   The IE shall only be sent, if SoLSA is supported. It indicates the
   LSA identity associated with the current position of the mobile
   user. Will be Sent if the LSA ID of subscription and LSA ID of the
   used cell matches. In the case of multiple matches the one with the
   highest priority is sent. See 3G TS 23.073.



3.1 CODING OF LOCATION INFORMATION ELEMENTS

3.1.1 Geographical Information
   The GeographicalInformation parameter refers to Geographical
   Information defined in GSM 03.32 Version 5.0.0. Only the description
   of an ellipsoid point with uncertainty circle as specified in GSM
   03.32 is allowed to be used.

   The GeographicalInformation parameter contains the following sub-
   parameters:

   - TypeofShape
   Type of shape can only have the value of an ellipsoid point with
   uncertainty circle.

   - SignLAT: Sign of latitude
      0 = North
      1 = South

   - LAT is the latitude expressed in degrees (0-90)

   - LONG is the longitude expressed in degrees (0-360)



Moreno                  Expires - October 2002                [Page 4]
                Mobility Events Management in SPIRITS      April 2002


   - UncertaintyCode: K (exponent), defines the numerical
   representation of the radius R expressed in meters, where:
                       K
      R = 10 ((1.1) - 1)   0 <= K <= 127


3.1.2 Age Of Location Information
   Usually coded as an integer (0..32767). The value represents the
   elapsed time in minutes since the last network contact of the mobile
   station.
   Some implementations define two special values:
   - value "0" indicates that the MS is currently in contact with the
   network
   - value "32767" indicates that the location information is at least
   32767 minutes old

3.1.3 CellId Or LAI
   It is usually coded as a string. The Cell Global Identification is
   defined in TS GSM 03.03. The internal structure is not described
   here (Octets are coded according to TS GSM 04.08).

3.1.4 location Number
   It is usually coded as a string (length : 2 - 10 octets). The
   internal structure is not described here.






4. WIRELESS-SPECIFIC SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS ON MOBILITY MANAGEMENT

   The inclusion of mobility events management in SPIRITS protocol
   allows locating a mobile user and using this information into new
   services which can provide several advantages for IP users. But this
   feature can become also a security problem if a mobile user's
   location information is provided to non-authenticated applications
   or users. The location information must be treated with maximum
   care, and it must be guaranteed that no external parties will be
   able to get it in any way.

   For example, if an enterprise has a set of mobile users and an
   application over SPIRITS, which periodically provides their location
   information, there must be a way to authenticate the subscribing IP
   users (enterprise), in order to provide the information only to the
   right ones. On the other hand, the enterprise (SPIRITS server) will
   only be able to access to the information related to their own
   phones, and not to any other one that is not included into a related
   list of accessible phones.


Moreno                  Expires - October 2002                [Page 5]
                Mobility Events Management in SPIRITS      April 2002



   It is better to consider authentication and securing as matters to
   be implemented in the final applications. The security requirements
   must ensure that an IP user will not be allowed to subscribe to any
   notifications on mobile phones that are out of its control. This can
   be carried out by managing access control lists, whose definition is
   out the scope of this document.

   Another difficulty appears in case of connections from users that
   employ non-fixed IP addresses (i.e. GPRS connections from a mobile
   user), because those IP addresses couldn't be checked against a list
   of profiles. A possible alternative could be the inclusion of secret
   key-codes into every subscription request. These key-codes would be
   checked by the SPIRITS application before enabling notifications of
   mobility events about a certain mobile phone. This case is not
   included into this document, and it would imply adding a new
   parameter (access-code) into the "Subscribe XML DTD". This point is
   left open for future discussing.







5. XML DTDS FOR MOBILITY EVENTS
   This section presents XML DTDs for managing the mobility events and
   their related parameters.

5.1 XML DTDS FOR NOTIFY
   The next lines comprehend the DTD's for notifying a mobility event.
   The Event_met parameter can be considered as a subset of the
   complete events list.
