Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values         June 2016


1.  Introduction

   Defining syntax for new HTTP header fields ([RFC7230], Section 3.2)
   is non-trivial.  Among the commonly encountered problems are:

   o  There is no common syntax for complex field values.  Several well-
      known header fields do use a similarly looking syntax, but it is
      hard to write generic parsing code that will both correctly handle
      valid field values but also reject invalid ones.

   o  The HTTP message format allows header fields to repeat, so field
      syntax needs to be designed in a way that these cases are either
      meaningful, or can be unambiguously detected and rejected.

   o  HTTP/1.1 does not define a character encoding scheme ([RFC6365],
      Section 2), so header fields are either stuck with US-ASCII
      ([RFC0020]), or need out-of-band information to decide what
      encoding scheme is used.  Furthermore, APIs usually assume a
      default encoding scheme in order to map from octet sequences to
      strings (for instance, [XMLHttpRequest] uses the IDL type
      "ByteString", effectively resulting in the ISO-8859-1 character
      encoding scheme [ISO-8859-1] being used).

   (See Section 8.3.1 of [RFC7231] for a summary of considerations for
   new header fields.)

   This specification addresses the issues listed above by defining both
   a generic JSON-based ([RFC7159]) data model and a concrete wire
   format that can be used in definitions of new header fields, where
   the goals were:

   o  to be compatible with header field recombination when fields occur
      multiple times in a single message (Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]),
      and

   o  not to use any problematic characters in the field value (non-
      ASCII characters and certain whitespace characters).

2.  Data Model and Format

   In HTTP, header fields with the same field name can occur multiple
   times within a single message (Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]).  When
   this happens, recipients are allowed to combine the field values
   using commas as delimiter.  This rule matches nicely JSON's array
   format (Section 5 of [RFC7159]).  Thus, the basic data model used
   here is the JSON array.

   Header field definitions that need only a single value can restrict



Reschke                 Expires December 25, 2016               [Page 3]

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values         June 2016


   themselves to arrays of length 1, and are encouraged to define error
   handling in case more values are received (such as "first wins",
   "last wins", or "abort with fatal error message").

   JSON arrays are mapped to field values by creating a sequence of
   serialized member elements, separated by commas and optionally
   whitespace.  This is equivalent to using the full JSON array format,
   while leaving out the "begin-array" ('[') and "end-array" (']')
   delimiters.

   The ABNF character names and classes below are used (copied from
   [RFC5234], Appendix B.1):

     CR               = %x0D    ; carriage return
     HTAB             = %x09    ; horizontal tab
     LF               = %x0A    ; line feed
     SP               = %x20    ; space
     VCHAR            = %x21-7E ; visible (printing) characters

   Characters in JSON strings that are not allowed or discouraged in
   HTTP header field values -- that is, not in the "VCHAR" definition --
   need to be represented using JSON's "backslash" escaping mechanism
   ([RFC7159], Section 7).

   The control characters CR, LF, and HTAB do not appear inside JSON
   strings, but can be used outside (line breaks, indentation etc).
   These characters need to be either stripped or replaced by space
   characters (ABNF "SP").

   Formally, using the HTTP specification's ABNF extensions defined in
   Section 7 of [RFC7230]:

     json-field-value = #json-field-item
     json-field-item  = JSON-Text
                      ; see [RFC7159], Section 2,
                      ; post-processed so that only VCHAR characters
                      ; are used

3.  Sender Requirements

   To map a JSON array to an HTTP header field value, process each array
   element separately by:

   1.  generating the JSON representation,

   2.  stripping all JSON control characters (CR, HTAB, LF), or
       replacing them by space ("SP") characters,

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values         June 2016


   3.  replacing all remaining non-VSPACE characters by the equivalent
       backslash-escape sequence ([RFC7159], Section 7).

   The resulting list of strings is transformed into an HTTP field value
   by combining them using comma (%x2C) plus optional SP as delimiter,
   and encoding the resulting string into an octet sequence using the
   US-ASCII character encoding scheme ([RFC0020]).

4.  Recipient Requirements

   To map a set of HTTP header field instances to a JSON array:

   1.  combine all header field instances into a single field as per
       Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230],

   2.  add a leading begin-array ("[") octet and a trailing end-array
       ("]") octet, then

   3.  run the resulting octet sequence through a JSON parser.

   The result of the parsing operation is either an error (in which case
   the header field values needs to be considered invalid), or a JSON
   array.

5.  Using this Format in Header Field Definitions

   [[anchor5: Explain what a definition of a new header field needs to
   do precisely to use this format, mention must-ignore extensibiliy]]

6.  Examples

   This section shows how some of the existing HTTP header fields would
   look like if they would use the format defined by this specification.

6.1.  Content-Length

   "Content-Length" is defined in Section 3.3.2 of [RFC7230], with the
   field value's ABNF being:

     Content-Length = 1*DIGIT

   So the field value is similar to a JSON number ([RFC7159], Section
   6).

   Content-Length is restricted to a single field instance, as it
   doesn't use the list production (as per Section 3.2.2 of [RFC7230]).
   However, in practice multiple instances do occur, and the definition
   of the header field does indeed discuss how to handle these cases.

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values         June 2016


   If Content-Length was defined using the JSON format discussed here,
   the ABNF would be something like:

     Content-Length = #number
                    ; number: [RFC7159], Section 6

   ...and the prose definition would:

   o  restrict all numbers to be non-negative integers without
      fractions, and

   o  require that the array of values is of length 1 (but allow the
      case where the array is longer, but all members represent the same
      value)

6.2.  Content-Disposition

   Content-Disposition field values, defined in [RFC6266], consist of a
   "disposition type" (a string), plus multiple parameters, of which at
   least one ("filename") sometime needs to carry non-ASCII characters.

   For instance, the first example in Section 5 of [RFC6266]:

     Attachment; filename=example.html

   has a disposition type of "Attachment", with filename parameter value
   "example.html".  A JSON representation of this information might be:

     {
       "Attachment": {
         "filename" : "example.html"
       }
     }

   which would translate to a header field value of:

     { "Attachment": { "filename" : "example.html" } }

   The third example in Section 5 of [RFC6266] uses a filename parameter
   containing non-US-ASCII characters:

     attachment; filename*=UTF-8''%e2%82%ac%20rates

   Note that in this case, the "filename*" parameter uses the encoding
   defined in [RFC5987], representing a filename starting with the
   Unicode character U+20AC (EURO SIGN), followed by " rates".  If the
   definition of Content-Disposition would have used the format proposed
   here, the workaround involving the "parameter*" syntax would not have

Internet-Draft     JSON Encoding for HTTP Field Values         June 2016


   been needed at all.

   The JSON representation of this value could then be:

     { "attachment": { "filename" : "\u20AC rates" } }

6.3.  WWW-Authenticate

   The WWW-Authenticate header field value is defined in Section 4.1 of
   [RFC7235] as a list of "challenges":

      WWW-Authenticate = 1#challenge

   ...where a challenge consists of a scheme with optional parameters:

     challenge   = auth-scheme [ 1*SP ( token68 / #auth-param ) ]

   An example for a complex header field value given in the definition
   of the header field is:

     Newauth realm="apps", type=1, title="Login to \"apps\"",
     Basic realm="simple"

   (line break added for readability)

   A possible JSON representation of this field value would be the array
   below:

     [
       {
         "Newauth" : {
           "realm": "apps",
           "type" : 1,
           "title" : "Login to \"apps\""
         }
       },
       {
         "Basic" : {
           "realm": "simple"
         }
       }
     ]

   ...which would translate to a header field value of:

     { "Newauth" : { "realm": "apps", "type" : 1,
                     "title": "Login to \"apps\"" }},
     { "Basic" : { "realm": "simple"}}

7.  Discussion

   This approach uses a default of "JSON array", using implicit array
   markers.  An alternative would be a default of "JSON object".  This
   would simplify the syntax for non-list-typed header fields, but all
   the benefits of having the same data model for both types of header
   fields would be gone.  A hybrid approach might make sense, as long as
   it doesn't require any heuristics on the recipient's side.

      Note: a concrete proposal was made by Kazuho Oku in <https://
      lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JanMar/0155.html>.

   [[anchor7: Use of generic libs vs compactness of field values..]]

   [[anchor8: Mention potential "Key" header field extension ([KEY]).]]

8.  Deployment Considerations

   This JSON-based syntax will only apply to newly introduced header
   fields, thus backwards compatibility is not a problem.  That being
   said, it is conceivable that there is existing code that might trip
   over double quotes not being used for HTTP's quoted-string syntax
   (Section 3.2.6 of [RFC7230]).

9.  Internationalization Considerations

   In HTTP/1.1, header field values are represented by octet sequences,
   usually used to transmit ASCII characters, with restrictions on the
   use of certain control characters, and no associated default
   character encoding, nor a way to describe it ([RFC7230], Section
   3.2).  HTTP/2 does not change this.

   This specification maps all characters which can cause problems to
   JSON escape sequences, thereby solving the HTTP header field
   internationalization problem.

   Future specifications of HTTP might change to allow non-ASCII
   characters natively.  In that case, header fields using the syntax
   defined by this specification would have a simple migration path (by
   just stopping to require escaping of non-ASCII characters).

10.  Security Considerations

   Using JSON-shaped field values is believed to not introduce any new
   threads beyond those described in Section 12 of [RFC7159], namely the
   risk of recipients using the wrong tools to parse them.

   Other than that, any syntax that makes extensions easy can be used to

   smuggle information through field values; however, this concern is
   shared with other widely used formats, such as those using parameters
   in the form of name/value pairs.
