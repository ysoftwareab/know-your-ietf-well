Abstract 
    
   This document presents a method to bootstrap IPSec authentication via 
   an "Authentication Server" (AS) and legacy user authentication (e.g., 
   RADIUS). The client machine communicates with the AS using a key 
   exchange protocol authenticated by the server only, and the derived 
   keys are used to protect the legacy user authentication. Once the 
   user is authenticated, the client machine obtains credentials from 
   the AS that can be later used to authenticate the client in a 
   standard IKE exchange with an IPSec-enabled security gateway. The 
   later stage does not require user intervention. The proposed server-
   authenticated key exchange uses an ISAKMP-based protocol, similar to 
   a simplified IKE exchange, and arbitrary legacy authentication is 
   supported via the use of the standard EAP protocol. 
    
1. Introduction 
    
   Despite the growing popularity of PKI, legacy user authentication is 
   not going away. There have been several proposals to integrate legacy 
   authentication directly into the IKE framework, such as [2] and [3]. 
   Recently Bellovin and Moskowitz proposed to offload this task into a 
   separate server, called an Authentication Server (AS). Some of the 
   advantages of a separate authentication server are:

   - The security gateway may implement IKE/IPSec only, without worrying 
     about legacy authentication. The same gateway can be deployed in 
     PKI-based and legacy-based organizations. 
   - A denial-of-service attack on the AS cannot compromise existing 
     connections at the gateway (thus alleviating the damage of such 
     attacks). This reduces the amount of work that needs to be done to 
     secure the AS against DoS attacks. 
   - The AS may or may not be co-located with a gateway, per the 
     organizationÆs policy. A separate AS off-loads the security gateway 
     but may involve extra cost. 
 
   This document adopts this separation of an Authentication Server. 
   However, in contrast to the mechanism proposed in [5] which uses 
   IPSec-unrelated protocols TLS and HTTP, the current solution is based 
   on simplified ISAKMP and IKE mechanisms. The protocol embeds 
   Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) messages [4] in ISAKMP 
   payloads to support multiple forms of legacy user authentication 
   (e.g. RADIUS). Following the proposal in [5], at the end of the 
   interaction with AS the client machine obtains credentials that can 
   be later used by the client to perform  regular IKE authentication 
   with an IPSec-enabled gateway.  The current draft defines several 
   forms of credentials and can be extended to support any or all of the 
   forms defined in [5]. Note that this document uses the term 
   "credentials" for both digital certificates and pre-shared secret 
   keys. 
    
   The PIC proposal overcomes some of the shortcomings in the solution 
   of [5]. In particular, it avoids the use of HTTP-based authentication 
   which is not general enough to support authentication schemes in 
   common use today, and avoids the need to support a full TLS 
   implementation (this is especially advantageous in the case where the 
   AS is co-located with an IPSec security gateway which does not 
   support TLS). The end result is also significantly more efficient. 
    
   It should be emphasized that this protocol requires no modification 
   to IKE. Instead it uses simplified elements of ISAKMP and IKE to 
   obtain a much less ambitious goal than general IKE, namely the secure 
   provisioning of credentials for successfully authenticated users. 
    
1.1. Protocol Entities 
    
   User: the human being at the client machine. 
   Client: a client machine which communicates with the authentication 
         server and the security gateway. 
   Authentication server (AS): a server at the organization which can 
         relay the user's authentication request to the legacy system. 
   Legacy authentication server (LAS): a RADIUS server, LDAP server and 
         the like, which the AS uses to authenticate the user. 
   Security gateway (GW): an IKE-enabled IPSec gateway. 
    
   The figure below presents the relations between the entities. Note 
   that any of the entities may be replicated for reliability. Such 
   redundancy mechanisms are outside the scope of this document.

   The PIC protocol is defined between the Client and the AS. All other 
   exchanges between the entities are implicit in the protocol and not 
   defined here. This applies in particular to legacy authentication 
   between AS and LAS, and certification between AS and the CA. 
    
1.2. PIC Protocol Overview 
    
   The three main stages of the proposed protocol are: 
    
   - The protocol establishes a one-way trust relationship between the 
     client and the AS. This means that only the server is 
     authenticated. A secure channel from the client to the AS is 
     created. 
   - Legacy user authentication is performed over this secured channel. 
     Legacy authentication information is transported using the standard 
     EAP [4] tunneled within ISAKMP. 
   - The AS sends the client a (typically short-term) credential which 
     can be used in subsequent IKE exchanges. This credential can be 
     thought of as a certificate, a private key generated or stored by 
     the AS and accompanied by a corresponding certificate, or it may 
     also be a symmetric secret key. 
    
   To minimize the number of messages exchanged, the second and third 
   stages share messages, and the protocol takes care to ensure security 
   of the third stage despite the fact that it is started while the 
   client is not yet authenticated. 
    
   We note that the protocol proposed here is architecturally very 
   similar to [5]. The difference is in the details: PIC uses EAP for a 
   more general legacy authentication, and eliminates the constraints of 
   TLS and HTTP. 
    
1.3. Conventions used in this document 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 [6].

1.4. Change Log 
    
   -00: Initial version, schematic. 
   -01: Much more detail, changed XAuth to EAP. 
    
2. Assumptions and Requirements 
    
   - User authentication involves interaction with the human user and 
     should be made as painless as possible. In particular, multiple 
     authentication sessions should be avoided if at all possible. 
   - Legacy authentication server software cannot be changed. Neither 
     can we modify the authentication database. The most we can do is 
     add external software on the same host. 
   - Defense against denial-of-service attacks should be maximized at 
     the gateway, more so than in the AS. In many cases traffic at the 
     gateway is more critical than remote access, e.g. when the gateway 
     implements VPN functions between distant sites. 
   - The protocol assumes that the Client is able to authenticate the 
     AS, i.e. it has been pre-configured with a public key (or a 
     certificate hash) for the server or for its CA. 
    
   See also Sec. @5.1 below for a list of lower-level requirements. 
    
3. PIC and ISAKMP 
    
   PIC is based on ISAKMP [13] and the ISAKMP IPSec DOI [7], with a few 
   minor additions. 
    
   The SA created during the first exchange of PIC MUST NOT be used for 
   any messages other than the PIC messages described here. The SA MUST 
   be destroyed when the PIC exchange is concluded. 
    
3.1. The PIC Exchange 
    
   PIC defines a new ISAKMP exchange. The ISAKMP Exchange Type for PIC 
   is 250. 
    
3.2. The PIC Transform 
    
   PIC defines a new Transform Identifier, KEY_PIC, for the Proposal 
   payload, since KEY_IKE implies mutual authentication while PIC only 
   provides unilateral authentication during the first exchange. 
    
   The value of KEY_PIC is 2. 
    
3.3. Protection of Payloads 
    
   The new ISAKMP payloads defined below are protected in two different 
   ways: 
    
   - In the second message of the protocol, only the body of the EAP 
     payload(s) is encrypted under the PIC SA. 
  
Sheffer, Krawczyk           Internet Draft                           4 

           PIC, A Pre-IKE Credential Provisioning Protocol  Sep. 2000 
 
 
   - In all the following messages, the entire message is encrypted. 
    
   In both cases, a MAC is computed over the plaintext payloads. This 
   special processing of the second message results from our desire to 
   stay within the current framework of ISAKMP processing, while 
   reducing the protocolÆs number of messages to the minimum. 
    
3.4. Informational Exchanges and Payloads 
    
   ISAKMP Informational exchanges are allowed at any point during PIC. 
    
   Notification and Vendor ID payloads may be inserted at any point 
   following the HASH payload in PIC messages. 
    
   There are no new Notify payloads defined in PIC. 
    
4. The PIC Protocol 
    
4.1. Transport 
    
   The PIC protocol is an ISAKMP exchange. It inherits the following 
   properties from ISAKMP: 
    
   - UDP transport. 
   - Use of port 500. 
   - Retransmission policy. 
    
   While EAP defines its own retransmission policy, where retransmission 
   is always performed by the server (the ôauthenticatorö, in EAP 
   terms), PIC does not employ that policy. In accordance with ISAKMP, 
   both peers MUST retransmit the last message, as long as a response 
   has not been received. 
    
   Implementation note: stage 2 of PIC involves manual password entry. 
   Retransmission timeouts should allow for human speeds. 
    
4.2. ISAKMP Payloads 
    
   PIC defines several new payloads: 
    
   - EAP û to embed EAP messages within ISAKMP. 
   - CREDENTIAL-REQUEST û allows the client to request a credential. 
   - CREDENTIAL û allows the AS to return a credential. 
    
   The following defines each of the payloads.

   The EAP Payload fields are defined as follows: 
    
   o Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of the 
     next payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last in 
     the message, then this field will be 0. 
    
   o RESERVED (1 octet) - Unused, set to 0. 
    
   o Payload Length (2 octets) - Length in octets of the current 
     payload, including the generic payload header, the transaction-
     specific header and the embedded message.  If the length does not 
     match the length of the payload headers plus the embedded message, 
     then the entire payload MUST be discarded. 
    
   o Sequence (1 octet) - a sequence number of EAP payloads in the 
     current exchange, starting at 1. The number is incremented for each 
     EAP payload when multiple payloads occur in a single message. Such 
     multiple payloads MUST be ordered within the ISAKMP message 
     according to their sequence number. A single payload sequence is 
     maintained between the Client and Server. 
    
   o RESERVED (3 octets) - Unused, set to 0. 
    
   o EAP Message - An EAP message as defined in [4], including any later 
     additions to the standard.

   o Type-Specific Information: this is a variable field, whose contents 
     depend on the Type and Subtype fields. This version of the protocol 
     defines the contents for 3 cases only. 
    
   For Type 1 with Subtype 1 (PKCS #7 wrapped X.509 certificate): this 
   field contains a certificate request in PKCS #10 [8] format 
   (CertificationRequest). The receiver MUST verify correctness of the 
   "signature" component, which proves possession of the private key 
   corresponding to the public key being certified. 
    
   For Type 1 with Subtype 4 (X.509 Certificate - Signature): this field 
   contains a certificate request in PKCS #10 [9] format 
   (CertificationRequest). The receiver MUST verify correctness of the 
   "signature" component, which proves possession of the private key 
   corresponding to the public key being certified. 
    
   For Type 2 with Subtype 4, this field is omitted. 
    
   All other Type-Subtype combinations are undefined. They MUST NOT be 
   sent, and MUST be rejected if received. 
 
4.2.3.      The CREDENTIAL Payload 
    
   The CREDENTIAL payload is defined to allow the AS to send various 
   types of credentials. Its payload type is 303. Its format is:

      The value None means that a credential according to the ClientÆs 
      request is not available. The entire PIC exchange is failed, and 
      any further behavior is outside the scope of this document. 
      Reserved values MUST be rejected by the receiver. 
       
   o Subtype (1 octet) - denotes a specific type of certificate. This is 
     only applicable when the Type field is 1 or 2. Otherwise, the value 
     is 0. Values are as defined in the ISAKMP CERTIFICATE payload (Sec. 
     3.9 of [13]).  
    
   o RESERVED (2 octets) - Unused, set to 0. 
    
   o Type-Specific Information: this is a variable field, whose contents 
     depend on the Type and Subtype fields. This version of the protocol 
     defines the contents for 3 cases only. 
    
   For Type 1 with Subtype 1 (PKCS #7 wrapped X.509 certificate): this 
   field contains a certificate or certificate chain in PKCS#7 [10] 
   format. 
    
   For Type 1 with Subtype 4 (X.509 Certificate - Signature): this field 
   contains an X.509 certificate. 
    
   For Type 2 with Subtype 4, the Information field contains a private 
   key and corresponding certificate, wrapped in a PKCS #12 [11] PFX 
   PDU. 
    
   All other Type-Subtype combinations are undefined. They MUST NOT be 
   sent, and MUST be rejected if received. 
    
   Note: for Type option 2, it is up to the serverÆs local policy to 
   decide whether a certificate is fetched from storage or generated 
   from new material. 
    
4.3. Protocol Notation 
    
   <PAYLOAD> denotes a single ISAKMP payload, constructed by 
   concatenating the generic ISAKMP payload header with the encrypted 
   body of the payload. The body is encrypted using the negotiated 
   encryption transform and keyed by material generated from SKEYID_e. 
   Such encryption may produce a longer payload, as a result of padding. 
    
   As in ISAKMP, '*' signifies payload encryption after the ISAKMP 
   header. This encryption MUST begin immediately after the ISAKMP 
   header and all payloads following the ISAKMP header MUST be 
   encrypted.

           PIC, A Pre-IKE Credential Provisioning Protocol  Sep. 2000 
 
 
    
4.4. Protocol Exchanges 
    
   The protocol consists of a variable number of messages, with a 
   minimum of 4 messages. 
    
   The first two messages are adopted from IKE Aggressive Mode with 
   Signature Authentication: 
    
        Client                               AS 
        ------                               -- 
    
   (1)  HDR, SA, KE, Ni            ==> 
    
   (2)                             <==   HDR, SA, KE, Nr, IDir,[ CERT, ] 
                                         SIG_R, HASH, <EAP> [, <EAP>...] 
    
   These two messages establish the PIC SA, used for the EAP payloads of 
   message (2) and for all the following messages. 
    
   Refer to Sec. 5.1 of [12] and Sec. 3 of [13] for a description of the 
   payloads. The value SKEYID and its derivatives SKEYID_a and SKEYID_e 
   are computed in the exact same way as defined in Sec. 5 of [12] for 
   the case of signature authentication. Similarly for the 
   Initialization Vector (IV), when applicable. SA encryption keying 
   material is derived as in [12], Appendix B. 
    
   The Transform Identifier in the SA payloads MUST be KEY_PIC. The 
   Authentication Method in the SA payload MUST be RSA Signatures or DSS 
   Signatures. Proposal negotiation takes place as in [12], for Phase 1. 
    
   Payloads are ordered as in Sec. 5 of [12], for Aggressive Mode with 
   Signatures. There are no additional constraints on the order of the 
   HASH and EAP payloads. 
    
   SIG_R is derived from HASH_R, as in [12]. HASH_R is computed 
   differently in PIC, to correct a typo in [12]. The responderÆs SA 
   payload is used in the calculation: 
    
   HASH_R = prf(SKEYID, g^xr | g^xi | CKY-R | CKY-I | SAr_b | IDir_b ) 
    
   The Client MUST validate the correctness of the SIG_R payload. If a 
   certificate is transmitted, the Client MUST verify that it is 
   trusted. 
    
   Message (2) MUST contain one or more EAP payloads. The EAP payload(s) 
   are encrypted under the PIC SA. The HASH payload is calculated over 
   the ISAKMP cookies, and the concatenated EAP payloads: 
    
   HASH = prf(SKEYID_a, CKY-I | CKY-R | EAP(1) | EAP(2)...) 
    
   The HASH may differ if any optional payloads, for example a Notify 
   payload, have been chained to the message.

   Messages (3) and (4) are: 
    
        Client                               AS 
        ------                               -- 
    
   (3)  HDR*, HASH, EAP, [EAP...,] ==> 
        [CREDENTIAL-REQUEST] 
    
   (4)                             <==   HDR*, HASH, EAP, [EAP...,] 
                                         [CREDENTIAL] 
    
        [Repeat of message (3)     ==> 
    
                                   <==   Repeat of message 4]... 
    
   Messages (3) and (4) may be repeated as required by the legacy 
   authentication method, alternating between the Client and the AS. 
    
   The last EAP payload sent by the AS MUST be a Success or a Failure 
   message, in the sense of [4]. A CREDENTIAL-REQUEST payload MUST be 
   sent exactly once, in the first message (3) sent by the Client. A 
   CREDENTIAL payload MUST be sent exactly once, in the last message 
   sent by the AS. 
    
   The Server SHOULD NOT process the CREDENTIAL-REQUEST before the 
   Client completes its authentication, i.e. just before the AS sends 
   the EAP Success message. This is to protect against denial of service 
   by a yet-unauthenticated client. 
    
   The protocol does not define how the AS produces the CREDENTIAL 
   payload, whether internally, in cooperation with a gateway or with a 
   CA. However, the Type/Subtype combination for the CREDENTIAL MUST be 
   the same as in the CREDENTIAL-REQUEST, unless the Type returned is 
   None (no credential is available). 
    
   The HASH payload is defined over the ISAKMP cookies and the 
   concatenated payloads: 
    
   HASH = prf(SKEYID_a, CKY-I | CKY-R | EAP(n) | EAP(n+1)... 
          [| CREDENTIAL-REQUEST] [| CREDENTIAL]) 
    
   The HASH may differ from the illustration above if the order of 
   payloads in the message differs from the illustrative example or if 
   any optional payloads, for example a notify payload, have been 
   chained to the message. 
    
   The HASH payload for each message MUST be checked by each recipient. 
    
   Each of messages 3 and 4 MUST NOT be repeated more than 10 times (not 
   counting retransmissions).

4.5. Protocol Security 
 
   The first two messages in the PIC protocol only provide server 
   authentication. Client authentication is provided during the second 
   stage of the protocol via the legacy user authentication mechanism in 
   use. Thus the resultant client authentication is no stronger than the 
   legacy user authentication mechanism. 
    
   The encryption key derived from SKEYID_e in the first stage protects 
   the secrecy of the user authentication and the credential exchange. 
   This results in perfect forward secrecy of the authentication 
   information even in the presence of an active man-in-the-middle 
   provided that the client and/or user verify the authenticity of the 
   server's public key. 
    
   The authentication (under SKEYID_a) of messages (3) and (4) binds the 
   identified user to the keys exchanged in messages (1) and (2) and is 
   necessary for the security of the protocol both for authentication 
   and confidentiality.  
    
   Recent research shows that the best way to combine the authentication 
   (MAC) and encryption of the legacy-authentication and credential 
   material is by first encrypting the information and then applying the 
   MAC on the ciphertext. Indeed, using results from [14] one can show 
   that under this order of operations PIC can be proved secure. 
   Unfortunately, the existing ISAKMP specifications and payload 
   processing support the other ordering, namely, first MAC the 
   plaintext then encrypt (i.e. compute a HASH payload on the plaintext, 
   then, if encryption is required, compute it over the plaintext and 
   HASH).  
    
   This is particularly troubling given recent work-in-progress [15] 
   that shows, for some class of secure ciphers, explicit attacks 
   against password protocols that are protected under the MAC-then-
   encrypt approach.  
    
   However, because of the preliminary character of the [15] results and 
   currently unknown weaknesses of the MAC-then-encrypt approach for 
   commonly used ciphers and modes of operation, we have chosen in this 
   specification to stick to the common ISAKMP processing in the 
   interest of facilitating PIC implementation with existing ISAKMP 
   code. 
    
5. Discussion 
    
5.1. Protocol Requirements 
    
   The PIC protocol was designed according to the IPSRA requirements and 
   constraints as defined in [16]. Among these are the following: 
    
   - Easy transition to certificate-based authentication. 
   - No change to IKE.

           PIC, A Pre-IKE Credential Provisioning Protocol  Sep. 2000 
 
 
   - No secret key assumed at the client beyond user authentication 
     material (password). 
   - Client is assumed to have the public key of AS or a way to validate 
     it. 
   - No support for machine authentication. 
    
5.2. Design Choices 
    
   Some of the design decisions that were made in developing this 
   protocol are: 
    
   - ISAKMP-based to reuse ISAKMP implementation. 
   - Transport of legacy authentication via an already standardized 
     protocol: EAP. 
   - Negotiation is kept to a minimum for simplicity. 
   - Reducing the number of messages via piggybacking. 
   - AS may or may not be decoupled from the gateway. 
   - Client is assumed to be pre-configured with the address of the AS, 
     as well as the security gateway. 
   - Full trust in AS. 
   - Short-term certificate avoids the need for human intervention if a 
     SA needs to be re-established ("single sign-on"). 
   - Server-side key generation and key storage have  been merged into a 
     single credential-request type. The choice of method is left to AS 
     policy. 
    
5.3. Legacy Authentication 
    
   Legacy authentication may be performed by the Authentication Server 
   or may be proxied by it to a legacy server. The protocol allows for 
   several types of authentication to be tried by the Server before it 
   decides that it cannot authenticate the Client. 
    
5.4. Credentials and Negotiation 
    
   The protocol as described requires the policies of Client and Server 
   to match regarding credentials. For example, an unrecoverable 
   protocol error results if the Client is unable to produce a private 
   key but the server requires this capability. 
    
   Several approaches for credential negotiation were considered and 
   rejected for this protocol, in the interest of simplicity. The 
   general case would require negotiation of multiple properties in 
   parallel, for example: 
    
   - Is the private key generated by the Client or the AS. 
   - What type of certificate is required, in particular which 
     algorithm. 
   - What length of keys is required, for each of the credentialÆs 
     components.

6. Security Considerations 
 

   This entire document discusses a protocol for the provisioning of 
   security-critical information. 
    
   The Authentication Server approach involves additional security 
   considerations which are beyond the scope of this document: they have 
   to do with secure storage of user credentials, and secure 
   communication with other (optional) entities, the CA, legacy 
   authentication server and gateway. 
    
   The Client is typically the less protected peer. Thus, when Type 1 
   credentials are used, the Client SHOULD generate a fresh key pair on 
   each PIC exchange. 
    
   The PIC protocol authenticates the human user. There is no attempt to 
   authenticate the machine from which the user is connecting. Thus the 
   AS is unable to make policy decisions according to the security of 
   the client machine. 
    
   Once the first exchange of the protocol is complete, the Client has 
   authenticated the AS and has full trust of the AS, for the purposes 
   of credential provisioning. Thus it is not required to validate the 
   credential it receives. Note that in some cases the Client cannot 
   validate the credential.
