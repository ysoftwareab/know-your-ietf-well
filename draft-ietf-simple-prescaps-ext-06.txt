Internet-Draft    User Agent Capability Presence Status     January 2006


1.  Introduction

   Interoperation of instant messaging and presence systems has been
   defined in IMPP Working Group (WG).The WG has defined "A model for
   Presence and Instant Messaging" in RFC2778 [2] and also requirements
   for protocols implementing such a system in RFC2779 [3].  Common
   presence (CPP) [5] and common profile for instant messaging (CPIM)
   [14] defines common operations and formats which all presence and
   instant messaging services must agree upon so that basic
   interoperability would be possible.  The actual base format for the
   presence is defined in the Presence Information Document Format
   (PIDF) [4].  The PIDF has been designed to reduce the need for
   gatewaying and to allow end-to-end security of presence data.  It has
   taken a very minimalistic approach to support such operations.  In
   order to make the PIDF usable by different presence applications,
   these applications usually must extend the basic PIDF by standard XML
   mechanisms as defined in PIDF [4].

   The aim of this memo is to introduce a SIP specific extension
   mechanism to the PIDF that conveys the same SIP media feature tags as
   described in RFC3840 [6].  With this extension presence applications
   based on SIP can have richer and more usable presence data compared
   to the baseline PIDF.

1.1.  Motivation

   The PIDF [4] defines a <contact> element which may appear once inside
   every <tuple> element.  The content of the <contact> element encodes
   the CONTACT ADDRESS and CONTACT MEANS as defined in RFC2778 [2].  The
   <contact> element is defined to be a URI of any scheme.  In some
   implementations the URI scheme can uniquely identify the service the
   tuple intends to describe (e.g. im: URI scheme usually represents
   Instant Messaging service).  However, this may not be the case in all
   implementations.  For example in SIP, a SIP URI scheme can represent
   different kinds of services.  A SIP URI scheme can be used to contact
   voice services, video services, or messaging services.  If it is not
   known by other means, it might be hard for applications processing
   the presence information document containing only a SIP URI contact
   addresses to know what particular service the tuple intends to
   describe.  Also watchers receiving presence information would
   probably benefit for getting more descriptive information about what
   particular communication means or services are supported by the
   presentity.

   RFC3840 [6] defines a set of extensions which allow callees to
   express preferences about request handling in SIP servers.  The same
   information can provide value also to presence watchers so that they
   can make more rational decisions on how a presentity should be

   contacted if a presence document contained similar information.

1.2.  Scope

   This document defines extensions to the PIDF which enables presence
   implementations based on SIP to utilize similar information in a
   presence information document as what RFC3840 [6] defines.

   This extension does not replace media negotiation mechanisms defined
   for SIP (e.g.  SDP [18]).  This extension is only aimed for
   presentities to give watchers hints about the presentity's
   preferences, willingness and capabilities to communicate before
   watchers initiate a communication with the presentity.


2.  Conventions

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1] and
   indicate requirement levels for compliant implementations.

   This memo makes use of the vocabulary defined in RFC2778 [2], and in
   RFC3863 [4].


3.  Extension for "Indicating User Agent Capabilities in the Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP)" in PIDF documents

   This section presents all extension documents, their elements, their
   values, and semantics.  This section also describes how this
   extension can be further extended.

   This extension is intended to be used within a PIDF [4] and that
   particular usage is described here.  This extension may also be used
   with other XML documents if appropriate.

3.1.  Overview of operation

   This document defines how the features presented in RFC3840 [6] can
   be provided as a part of presence data.  Additionally, this memo
   includes the "type" feature tag [7], "message" media type feature tag
   [19] and the "language" feature tag [8] definitions.  Bringing these
   features in the PIDF means mapping them to an XML formatted
   structure.

   The presence data model [11] defines presence data consisting of
   three types of data elements: person, service, and device.  This memo

   follows this model so that one XML document is defined to describe
   device capabilities and another one to describe service capabilities.

   The namespace URIs for elements defined by this document are URNs
   using the namespace identifier 'ietf' defined by RFC2648 [9] and
   extended by RFC3688 [10].

   When these extension namespaces are congregated with the PIDF
   document, the combined document MUST follow the same general
   formatting rules as specified in Section 4.1 of the RFC3863 [4].

3.2.  Service capability element

   Elements belonging to service capabilities are used to describe
   characteristics of a service.  All elements defined in this section
   describe dynamic data about the service.  This element SHOULD be
   located in PIDF document as a child element of
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf namespace <tuple> [4] element.

   Namespace identifier for this element is:

   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:caps

3.2.1.  <servcaps> element

   (i.e. that appears in a 'Content-type:' header of the corresponding
   MIME-formatted data) as defined in RFC2913 [7].

   The <type> element is a string type and does not have any attributes.
   It MUST be a string of the form "type/subtype", where 'type' and
   'subtype' are defined by the MIME specification [12].  Only lower-
   case letters SHOULD be used.

3.2.10.  <automata> element

   The <automata> element indicates whether the service represents an
   automata (such as a voicemail server, conference server, IVR, or
   recording device) or a human as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <automata> element is a boolean type and does not have any
   attributes.  The value 'true' indicates that the service represents
   an automata and the value 'false' indicates that it represents a
   human.

   listed under <supported> element and all classes that are not
   supported by the service are listed under <notsupported> element.

   <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain <business> and
   <personal> elements followed by any number of optional extension
   elements from other namespaces.  The semantics of business and
   personal are defined in RFC3840 [6] as:

   o  <business>: The service is used for business communications.

   o  <personal>: The service is used for personal communications.

   Any value that is registered with IANA for the SIP Media Feature Tag
   Registration Tree as a sip.class media feature tag can be used as a
   value of an extension element.  If the appropriate value is not
   registered it SHOULD be registed as defined in RFC3840 [6].

3.2.12.  <duplex> element

   The <duplex> element lists whether a communications service can
   simultaneously send and receive media ("full"), alternate between
   sending and receiving ("half"), only receive ("receive-only") or only
   send ("send-only") as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <duplex> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All duplex modes that are supported by the service
   are listed under <supported> element and all duplex modes that are
   not supported by the service are listed under <notsupported> element.

   <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain <full>, <half>,
   <receive-only> and <send-only> elements followed by any number of
   optional extension elements from other namespaces.  The semantics of
   these elements are defined in RFC3840 [6] as:

   o  <full>: The service can simultaneously send and receive media.

   o  <half>: The service can alternate between sending and receiving
      media.

   o  <receive-only>: The service can only receive media.

   o  <send-only>: The service can only send media.

   Any value that is registered with IANA for the SIP Media Feature Tag
   Registration Tree as a sip.class media feature tag can be used as a
   value of an extension element.  If the appropriate value is not
   registered it SHOULD be registed as defined in RFC3840 [6].

3.2.13.  <description> element

   The <description> element provides a textual description of the
   service as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <description> element is of string type and does not have any
   attributes.

3.2.14.  <event-packages> element

   The <event-packages> element lists the event packages supported by a
   service.

   The <event-packages> element can contain two elements: <supported>
   and <notsupported>.  All event packages that are supported by the
   service are listed under <supported> element and all event packages
   that are not supported by the service are listed under <notsupported>
   element.

   <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain <presence>,
   <message-summary>, <reg>, <refer>, <winfo>, <spirits-user-prof>,
   <spirits-user-prof>, <spirits-INDPs>, and <Siemens-RTP-Stats>
   followed by any number of optional extension elements from other
   namespaces.

   Any value that is registered with IANA for the SIP Event types
   namespace registry can be used as a value of an extension element.

3.2.15.  <priority> element

   The <priority> element indicates the call priorities the service is
   willing to handle.

   The <priority> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All priority values that are supported by the
   service are listed under <supported> element and all priority values
   that are not supported by the service are listed under <notsupported>
   element.

   The <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain any number of
   <lowerthan>, <higherthan>, <equals> and <range> elements followed by
   any number of optional extension elements from other namespaces.

3.2.15.1.  <lowerthan> element

   The <lowerthan> element has a single attribute called "maxvalue".
   The "maxvalue" attribute is used to give the highest priority value
   that the service is willing to support.  All values equal and below
   that value are supported.

3.2.15.2.  <higherthan> element

   The <higherthan> element has a single attribute called "minvalue".
   The "minvalue" attribute is used to give the lowest priority value
   that the service is willing to support.  All values equal and above
   that value are supported.

3.2.15.3.  <equals> element

   The <equals> element is used to indicate the exact priority value
   that the service is willing to handle.  The <equals> element has a
   single attribute called "value".  The "value" attribute is used to
   indicate the exact supported priority value.

3.2.15.4.  <range> element

   The <range> element is used to indicate the priority range that the
   service is willing to handle.  The <range> element has two attributes
   called "min" and "max".  Value of the "min" attribute indicates
   lowest priority value supported by the service and the value of the
   "max" attribute indicates the highest priority value supported by the
   service.

3.2.16.  <methods> element

   The <methods> element indicates the SIP methods supported by a
   service.  In this case, "supported" means that the service can
   receive requests with this method.  In that sense, it has the same
   connotation as the Allow header field as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <methods> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All methods that are supported by the service are
   listed under <supported> element and all methods that are not
   supported by the service are listed under <notsupported> element.

   The <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain <ACK>, <BYE>,
   <CANCEL>, <INFO>, <INVITE>, <MESSAGE>, <NOTIFY>, <OPTIONS>, <PRACK>,
   <PUBLISH>, <REFER>, <REGISTER>, <SUBSCRIBE>, and <UPDATE> elements
   followed by any number of optional extension elements from other
   namespaces.

   Any value that is registered with IANA for the SIP methods namespace
   registry can be used as a value of an extension element.

3.2.17.  <extensions> element

   The <extensions> element is a list of SIP extensions (each of which
   is defined by an option-tag registered with IANA) that are understood
   by the service.  Understood, in this context, means that the option
   tag would be included in a Supported header field in a request as
   defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <extensions> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All extensions that are supported by the service are
   listed under <supported> element and all extensions that are not

   supported by the service are listed under <notsupported> element.

   The <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain <rel100>,
   <join>, <path>, <precondition>, <pref>, <privacy>, <replaces>,
   <histinfo> and <sec-agree> elements followed by any number of
   optional extension elements from other namespaces.

   Any value that is defined in IANA SIP parameters registry option tags
   table can be used as a value of an extension element.

3.2.18.  <schemes> element

   The <schemes> element provides the set of URI schemes that are
   supported by a service.  Supported implies, for example, that the
   service would know how to handle a URI of that scheme in the Contact
   header field of a redirect response as defined in [6].

   The <schemes> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All schemes that are supported by the service are
   listed under <supported> element and all schemes that are not
   supported by the service are listed under <notsupported> element.

   <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain any number of <s>
   elements which can be used to describe individual schemes supported
   by the service.

3.2.18.1.  <s> element

   The <s> element is of string type and it is used to describe
   individual scheme supported by the service.  Values that can be used
   here are scheme names that are registered to IANA URI scheme
   registry.

3.2.19.  <actor> element

   The <actor> element indicates the type of entity that is available at
   this URI as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <actor> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All actor types that are supported by the service
   are listed under <supported> element and all actor types that are not
   supported by the service are listed under <notsupported> element.

   The <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain <principal>,
   <attendant>, <msg-taker>, and <information> elements followed by any
   number of optional extension elements from other namespaces.

   The semantics of these elements are defined in RFC3840 [6] as:

   o  <principal>: The service provides communication with the principal
      that is associated with the service.  Often this will be a
      specific human being, but it can be an automata (for example, when
      calling a voice portal).

   o  <attendant>: The service provides communication with an automata
      or person that will act as an intermediary in contacting the
      principal associated with the service, or a substitute.

   o  <msg-taker>: The service provides communication with an automata
      or person that will take messages and deliver them to the
      principal.

   o  <information>: The service provides communication with an automata
      or person that will provide information about the principal.

   Any value that is registered with IANA for the SIP Media Feature Tag
   Registration Tree as a sip.class media feature tag can be used as a
   value of an extension element.  If the appropriate value is not
   registered it SHOULD be registed as defined in RFC3840 [6].

3.2.20.  <isfocus> element

   The <isfocus> element indicates that the service is a conference
   server, also known as a focus as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <isfocus> element is of boolean type and does not have any
   attributes.

3.2.21.  <languages> element

   The <languages> element indicates the ability to display particular
   human languages as defined in RFC2987 [8].

   The <languages> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All languages that are supported by the service are
   listed under <supported> element and all languages that are not
   supported by the service are listed under <notsupported> element.

   <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain any number of <l>
   elements which can be used to describe individual languages supported
   by the service.

3.2.21.1.  <l> element

   The <l> element is of string type and it is used to describe
   individual language supported by the service.  Values that can be
   used here are language names that are registered to IANA as per

   RFC2987 [8].

3.3.  Device capability element

   Elements belonging to device capabilities are used to describe the
   dynamic status of a device [11].  This element SHOULD be located in
   the PIDF document as a child element of
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:data-model namespace <device> element
   [11].

   Namespace identifier for this element is urn:

   ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:caps.

3.3.1.  <devcaps> element

   The root element of device capabilities is <devcaps>.  The root
   element has to be always present.  This element can contain following
   elements: <mobility>, <priority>, and <description> followed by any
   number of optional extension elements from other namespaces.

   A <devcaps> element does not have any attributes.

3.3.2.  <mobility> element

   The <mobility> element indicates whether the device is fixed (meaning
   that it is associated with a fixed point of contact with the
   network), or mobile (meaning that it is not associated with a fixed
   point of contact).  Note that cordless phones are fixed, not mobile,
   based on this definition as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <mobility> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All mobility modes that are supported by the device
   are listed under <supported> element and all mobility modes that are
   not supported by the device are listed under <notsupported> element.

   The <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain <fixed> and
   <mobile> elements followed by any number of optional extension
   elements from other namespaces.

   The semantics of these elements are defined in RFC3840 [6] as:

   o  <fixed>: The device is stationary.

   o  <mobile>: The device can move around with the user.

   Any value that is register to IANA to SIP Media Feature Tag
   Registration Tree as sip.mobility media feature tag can be used as a

   value of an extension element.  If the appropriate value is not
   registered it SHOULD be registed as defined in RFC3840 [6].

3.3.3.  <priority> element

   The <priority> element indicates the call priorities the device is
   willing to handle.

   The <priority> element can contain two elements: <supported> and
   <notsupported>.  All priority values that are supported by the device
   are listed under <supported> element and all priority values that are
   not supported by the device are listed under <notsupported> element.

   The <supported> and <notsupported> elements can contain any number of
   <lowerthan>, <higherthan>, <equals> and <range> elements followed by
   any number of optional extension elements from other namespaces.

3.3.3.1.  <lowerthan> element

   The <lowerthan> element has a single attribute called "maxvalue".
   The "maxvalue" attribute is used to give the highest priority value
   that the device is willing to support.  All values equal and below
   that value are supported.

3.3.3.2.  <higherthan> element

   The <higherthan> element has a single attribute called "minvalue".
   The "minvalue" attribute is used to give the lowest priority value
   that the device is willing to support.  All values equal and above
   that value are supported.

3.3.3.3.  <equals> element

   The <equals> element is used to indicate the exact priority value
   that the device is willing to handle.  The <equals> element has a
   single attribute called "value".  Value of the "value" attribute is
   used to indicate the exact supported priority value.

3.3.3.4.  <range> element

   The <range> element is used to indicate the priority range that the
   device is willing to handle.  The <range> element has two attributes
   called "min" and "max".  Value of the "min" attribute indicates
   lowest priority value supported by the device and the value of the
   "max" attribute indicates the highest priority value supported by the
   device.

3.3.4.  <description> element

   The <description> element provides a textual description of the
   device as defined in RFC3840 [6].

   The <description> element is of string type and does not have any
   attributes.


4.  Usage guidelines

   In RFC3840 [6] it is recommended that a UA provides complete
   information in its contact predicate.  However, it may be that
   presentity is not willing to publish presence information which would
   be consistent with actual device or service capabilities (e.g.
   presentity may not want to indicate that he/she supports voice when
   the service actually is able to support it).  Also authorization
   rules or policies in presence server may limit or modify the
   published presence information in a way that all published presence
   information may not end up to all possible watchers.

   It is RECOMMENTED that Presence User Agents (PUAs) using this
   extension provide as complete presence information as they can.  If
   the PUA is publishing sensitive information using this extension, it
   SHOULD obtain a permission from a user.  PUAs can indicate all the
   explicitly supported capabilities using the <supported> element and
   all the explicitly not supported capabilities using the
   <notsupported> element, where appropriate.

   However, it is not mandated that this presence information should be
   consistent with actual device capabilities.  Also, watchers should
   not expect that the presence information represented by this
   extension fully represents the actual presentity's device
   capabilities.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo calls for IANA to register one new XML namespace URNs as
   defined in RFC3688 [10].

7.1.   URN sub-namespace registration for
      'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:caps'

   URI:
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:caps

   Description:
   This is the XML namespace for XML elements defined by [[[RFCXXXX]]]
   to describe service and device capabilities in application/pidf+xml
   content type.

   Registrant Contact:

8.  Security Considerations

   All security considerations specified in RFC3859 [5] and in RFC3863
   [4] apply to this document.  Compared to PIDF [4] this presence
   document format may reveal additional information about user's
   service and device capabilities.  Thus, the PUA SHOULD always obtain
   permission from the user when publishing sensitive information using
   this extension.

   Because presence is very privacy-sensitive information, the transport
   protocol for the presence information SHOULD have capabilities to
   protect protocol messages from possible threats, such as
   eavesdropping, corruption, tamper and replay attacks.  If such
   security measures are not used, eavesdroppers can learn sensitive
   information about the user.  It may be possible for a third party to
   modify the user's presence information.  This can lead to a situation
   that users receiving presentity's presence information can take
   incorrect actions based on false information.  The protocols SHOULD
   be able to use security mechanisms which are standardized or being
   standardized in IETF.  However, it depends on the actual transport
   protocols which security mechanisms should be used, and it is beyond
   the scope of this memo.
