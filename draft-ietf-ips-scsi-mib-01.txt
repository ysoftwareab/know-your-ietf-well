       1.  The SNMP Management Framework 
        
       The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
       components:

          o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1]. 
        
          o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for 
              the purpose of management.  The first version of this 
              Structure of Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and 
              described in STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and 
              RFC 1215 [4].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described 
              in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and STD 58, RFC 
              2580 [7]. 
        
          o  Message protocols for transferring management information. The 
              first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 
              and described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of 
              the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards 
              track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 
              [9] and RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the message 
              protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 
              2572 [11] and RFC2574[12]. 
        
          o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
              first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
              described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of protocol 
              operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
              [13]. 
        
          o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [14] 
              and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 
              2575[15]. 
        
       A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
       Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [16]. 
        
       Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
       the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are 
       defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
        
       This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
       MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
       translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
       equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
       translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable 
       information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
       SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of 
       machine-readable information is not considered to change the 
       semantics of the MIB.

       RFC 2119 [23]. 
        
       3.  Overview 
        
       This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) 
       for use with network management protocols in the Internet community. 
       In particular, it describes a set of managed objects to configure 
       and monitor Small Computer System Interface entities (SCSI 
       entities), i.e. SCSI devices, SCSI targets and Initiators and SCSI 
       Ports. The MIB is based on documents issued by the T-10 Technical 
       Committee and specially on SAM-2 (SCSI Architecture Model - 2) 
       document [17]. 
        
        
       The SCSI protocol is a client-server protocol allowing an 
       application layer client to transmit commands to a device server and 
       to a task manager using an interconnect subsystem. 
       The client side is referred as the initiator side and the server 
       side is referred as the target side. 
       A target includes a collection of logical units; each logical unit 
       has a task manager allowing an initiator to execute commands. 
        
       3.1 Introduction 
       In the late 1970s a firm called Shugart Associates started to have 
       some considerable success with a peripheral interface definition in 
       what became the PC marketplace, and this interface was adopted 
       and extended by an open standards committee to form the Small 
       Computer Systems Interface (SCSI).  
       SCSI defined an 8 bit wide multi-drop ææbusÆÆ structure which could 
       interconnect a total of eight peripherals and computer systems. 
     
       ItÆs important to realize that all SCSI initially standardized was 
       the ææphysical connectionÆÆ i.e. the connectors, cables and interface 
       signals. Thus even though a peripheral could be connected to 
       multiple systems, the information that flowed across the interface 
       was different in each case.  
       This was addressed some five years later by the definition of a 
       Common Command Set, and with this definition in place it was 
       possible for the first time to develop a peripheral with both a 
       common interface and common operating firmware for connection to 
       multiple systems. 
        
       The physical interface of SCSI continued to be developed throughout 
       the 1980s with the addition of fast (up to 10 megabytes/s) and wide 
       (16 bits) variants, but the distance supported remained a maximum of 
       25 meters (from one end of the bus to another), and indeed some of 
       the faster variants supported much less than that distance. The 
       command set development continued, with special commands for tapes, 
       printers, and even processors being added to the original disk-
       oriented set.

       So successful was SCSI in the 1980s that the majority of the 
       available Operating Systems incorporated support for the SCSI 
       command set as standard. 
        
       However at the end of the 1980s the distance, speed and number of 
       devices supported by SCSI were starting to become significant 
       impediments to systems design, and while the "information explosion" 
       had not yet started in earnest, it was already being anticipated. At 
       the same time, the serial interface technologies developed for Local 
       Area Networks such as Ethernet, and the fibre optics technologies 
       that were first deployed in telecommunications applications, were 
       starting to appear sufficiently rugged & low-cost for use in 
       peripheral interface applications.  
       Thus a standards project was begun in 1988 to develop a new serial, 
       fibre-optic interface to carry the SCSI command sets and other 
       peripheral protocols. This interface eventually became known as 
       Fibre Channel (FC), and it is based on an architecture centered 
       around an abstractly defined "fabric", which may be a switch or a 
       loop connection. MIBs for various FC equipments are already in 
       existence. 
        
       In order to support the new interfaces, it was necessary to 
       completely reorganize the SCSI standards and definitions. The 
       command sets were separated from the physical interface definitions, 
       and a SCSI Architectural Model (SAM) was created to define the 
       interaction between the various standards. It is a key to 
       understanding SAM to realize that it was first created approximately 
       10 years AFTER the first SCSI products were shipped!! 
        
       The most recent development in this saga occurred in 2000 when an 
       IETF Working Group was formed to address, amongst other things, a 
       definition for transporting the SCSI command sets directly over a 
       TCP/IP infrastructure. This effort is know as iSCSI, and an iSCSI 
       MIB is already under development.

       All projects are in T10, except Fibre Channel is in T11 and 1394 is 
       in IEEE. 
     
        
       3.2 SCSI Terminology 
       The definitions below are part of T.10 Proposal for SAM-2 [17]. They 
       are copied from [17]. 
        
       3.2.1 SCSI application layer 
       The protocols and procedures that implement or invoke SCSI commands 
       and task management functions by using services provided by a SCSI 
       protocol layer. 
        
       3.2.2 SCSI Device 
       A SCSI device is an entity that contains one or more SCSI ports that 
       are connected to a service delivery subsystem and supports a SCSI 
       application protocol. 
        
       3.2.3 SCSI Port 
       A device-resident object that connects the application client, 
       device server or task manager to the service delivery subsystem 
       through which requests and responses are routed. SCSI port is 
       synonymous with port and either a SCSI initiator port or a SCSI 
       target port. 
     
       3.2.4 SCSI Initiator Device 
       A SCSI initiator device contains application clients and SCSI 
       initiator ports that originate device service and task management 
       requests to be processed by a target SCSI device. When used this 
       term refers to SCSI initiator devices or SCSI target/initiator 
       devices that are using the SCSI target/initiator port as a SCSI 
       initiator port. 
        
       3.2.5 SCSI Initiator Port 
       A SCSI initiator device object acts as the connection between 
       application clients and the service delivery subsystem through which 
       requests and responses are routed. In all cases when this term is 
       used it refers to an initiator port or a SCSI target/initiator port 
       operating as a SCSI initiator port. 
        
       3.2.6 SCSI Target Device 
       A SCSI device containing logical units and SCSI target ports that 
       receives device service and task management requests for processing. 
       When used this term refers to SCSI target devices or SCSI 
       target/initiator devices that are using the SCSI target/initiator 
       port as a SCSI target port. 
        
       3.2.7 SCSI Target Port 
       A SCSI target device object contains a task router and acts as the 
       connection between device servers and task managers and the service 
       delivery subsystem through which requests and responses are routed.

       When this term is used it refers to a SCSI target port or a SCSI 
       target/initiator port operating as a SCSI target port. 
        
       3.2.8 Logical Units 
       A entity residing in the target that implements a device model and 
       processes SCSI commands sent by an application client. 
        
       3.2.9 Logical Unit Number 
       Logical Unit Number or LUN is a 64-bit identifier for a logical 
       unit. 
        
       3.2.10 Nexus 
       A nexus is a relationship between two SCSI devices and the initiator 
       and target objects within those SCSI devices. 
              I_T Nexus:     A nexus between an initiator and a target 
              I_T_L Nexus:   A nexus between an initiator, a target and a 
                             logical unit. 
              I_T_L_Q Nexus: A nexus between an initiator, a target, a 
                             logical unit and a tagged task. 
              I_T_L_x Nexus: Either am I_T_L nexus or an I_T_L_Q nexus. 
               
       3.2.11 Interconnect subsystem 
       One or more physical interconnects that appear as a single path for 
       the transfer of information between SCSI devices. 
        
       3.2.12 Device Server 
       A device server is an object within the logical unit that processes 
       SCSI tasks according to the rules for task management. 
        
       3.2.13 Task Manager 
       A task manager is a server within the target that processes task 
       management functions. 
        
        
            
       3.3  SCSI MIB implementations 
            
       The SCSI MIB is a basic building block to use in the various SCSI 
       management scenarios. 
       The SCSI MIB will be implemented in every SCSI entity in the system. 
       A SCSI entity can be a SCSI Initiator device, SCSI Target device or 
       SCSI Initiator and Target device. As SCSI devices may contain more 
       than one SCSI entity, it is possible that more than one SCSI MIB 
       instance, and its respective agent, will reside in a single device. 
        
       Along this chapter figures have been provided to describe the 
       location of the SCSI MIB implementation in the various SCSI 
       management scenarios.  
       The location of the SCSI SNMP agent implementing the SCSI MIB are 
       denoted with '*'.

       Figure 1: Single SCSI Initiator device and Single SCSI Target device  
        
            
       Figure 1 describes a simple SCSI management scenario of a SCSI 
       Initiator device, a SCSI Target device and a Management station. 
       In this scenario there are two SNMP agents, each containing its SCSI 
       instance and its respective objects. 
       As the SCSI Target and SCSI Initiator device are interconnected, 
       their Target and Initiator port objects will be complementary.  
          'TBD AttachedObjects description' 
       In addition to the SCSI transport (e.g. parallel SCSI, FCP, iSCSI), 
       a management interface and transport (e.g. UDP),is provided in both 
       the Target and the Initiator.

       Figure 3: Multiple Hosts, Virtualization device and multiple Targets 
            
            
       Figure 3 adds an in-band virtualization device, which encapsulates, 
       and possibly modifies, the SCSI Target devices representation to the 
       SCSI Initiator devices. It is common practice for an in-band 
       virtualization device, to include both SCSI Target and Initiator 
       device functionality. Therefore, its SCSI MIB implementation 
       includes both the SCSI Target and Initiator device objects. It 
       should be noted that the Virtualization device might implement 
       additional proprietary MIBs, as the SCSI MIB does not provide this 
       kind of functionality. 
        
     
       3.4 Bridging and Virtualization 
        
       Storage virtualization is a concept that abstracts storage resources 
       in such a way that, storage entities are provided as pool of logical 
       entities. 
       Usually the virtualization process is transparent the storage users 
       (i.e. Hosts). Virtualization normally affects the SCSI entities 
       represented to SCSI Initiators. However, the SCSI MIB should enable

       SCSI MIB                                  January 2002 
     
       the representation of SCSI entities and their respective status, 
       including error and performance-monitoring statistics. It should be 
       possible to perform a limited number of configuration modification 
       and diagnostic actions.  
       The SCSI entities embodied in the bridging and virtualization 
       devices should be represented by the SCSI MIB. However, Bridging and 
       Virtualization devices configuration is beyond the above-described 
       scope and therefore should be provided through enterprise MIBs. 
        
       4.Structure of the MIB 
         This MIB is composed as traditionally with three main groups: 
              . scsiObjects 
              . scsiNotifications 
              . scsiConformance 
        
         The scsiObjects group is composed itself of four groups: 
          
       4.1 General Group 
         The scsiGeneral group contains the parameters general to the 
       managed scsi entity. It contains also the generic device and port 
       tables. 
        
       Note that a SCSI entity may contain more than one SCSI device and 
       more than one SCSI port.  
        
        
       4.2 Initiator Group 
         The scsiInitiator group contains all the managed information 
       related to an initiator device and port. In addition, it contains 
       the scsiIntrDiscoveredTarget group that will allow a manager to 
       check the targets and LUNs devices discovered by an initiator device 
       or port. 
        
       4.3 Target Group 
         The scsiTarget group contains all the managed information related 
       to a target device and port. In addition, it contains the 
       scsiLogicalUnit group that summarizes all the managed information 
       concerning logical units, LUN hierarchy and logical unit 
       identifiers. 
        
       4.4 The Transport Group 
         This group is a collection of transports that can be used by SCSI. 
       The transport fixes the format of SCSI Names and Identifiers. 
     
       5.Relationship to Other MIBs 
          
       5.1 Host Resource MIB 
         This portion of MIB extends those managed objects to SCSI specific 
       entities but doesn't contain reference to software like device 
       driver. If MIB objects are required for installed packages of SCSI 
       software, then the hrSWInstalledGroup of the host resource MIB (RFC 
       2790 [22]) are the standard MIB objects to use.

       6. MIBS Specific Issues 
     
       6.1 Names and Identifiers 
         The names and the identifiers of the SCSI devices, ports and 
         logical units depend on the underlying transport protocols; their 
         format and length vary accordingly. Please refer to [20] in order 
         to get more details. 
          
       6.2 Logical Unit Number 
         The logical unit number is a 64-bit integer. This type does not 
         exist in SMI and therefore, we need to define it as a textual 
         convention for this MIB. 
        
       6.3 State and status 
     
       Definitions: 
        - Protected: Protected objects are objects that are able to 
       tolerate one or more objects failing without any loss of data or 
       loss of data availability. 
        
       Reference:  
       For more information on the logical unit states see the SCSI 
       Controller Commands-2 (SCC-2) standard (NCITS.318-1998) 
        
       Notification: 
       Separate SNMP traps may be enabled/disabled to notify of a change in 
       any of the SCSI device status variables. A notification will be 
       generated for each occurrence of the abnormal status (e.g., if the 
       SCSI deviceÆs current status is abnormal and another logical unit 
       changes its status to from available another notification will 
       occur). Other restrictions as to the frequency of the notifications 
       are TBD. 
        
     
       6.4 SCSI Domains 
     
       SAM-2 specifies that devices belong to a domain. However, it is not 
       usually possible to determine this from within a system, so domains 
       are not represented within this MIB.

       In this case, the HBA will act as the scsi initiator and a scsi disk 
       attached to the bus acts as the scsi target. Here we consider a 
       simple case of a single logical unit with a single LUN. 
        
        
       Considerations for including this topology: 
       ----------------------------------------- 
       This is a simple case, which can be used to validate the basic 
       soundness of the model from a parallel SCSI point of view. 
        
        
        
       Population of the objects:

       ScsiDevice: 
       ----------- 
        
       For each device in the scsi bus, there is a corresponding row in the 
       table. 
       In this scenario we have two scsi devices hence we will have two 
       rows created.

                             target. In our current scenario we have only 
                             one logical unit associated with the target

       This object will give a list of active SCSI Ports for each SCSI 
       device in the instance. Hence the table will get populated with 
       number of rows equivalent to the total number of active ports of all 
       the scsi devices in the scsi instance. Here, we have two active 
       ports one is an initiator port and one is a target port.

       scsiLUIndex      -> Administrative index in the Logical Unit table. 
       scsiDefaultLun  -> This attribute represents a simple case in which

                        case LU_IPort_Info will not be populated. 
                        As this is a simple case of one LU having one LU 
                        we will have this value as 0.which is the default

       -------------- 
        
       This object is populated when there is more than one LUN to a single 
       logical unit. Also this will have the persistent information about 
       an initiator on a LU a basis. In our current we have one initiator 
       and one target with single LUN. 
       As this is a simple case with one LU having one LUN, this object 
       will not be populated in this scenario.

       This object will be populated with the state information of 
       initiators currently active. So this object will have the state info 
       of the initiators currently attached to every target port. In our 
       scenario we have a target device with one target port .So this table 
       will populate, for each target port, all the attached initiator 
       ports attached dynamically. 
       In our scenario we will get one row populated for one initiator

       LUNs for certain initiators, the information is persistent. The 
       agent will collect this info into this object.

  SCSI MIB                                  January 2002 

 There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have       
 a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such objects 
 may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
 environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
 environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
 network operations. 
   
 Some managed objects in this MIB may contain sensitive information. 
   
 SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
 itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no 
 control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
 GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
   
 It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features 
 as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the 
 User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the View-based Access 
 Control Model RFC 2575 [15] are recommended. 
   
 It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
 entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
