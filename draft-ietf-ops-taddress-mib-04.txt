Abstract

   This document introduces a MIB module which defines textual
   conventions to represent commonly used transport-layer addressing
   information.  The definitions are compatible with the concept of
   TAddress/TDomain pairs introduced by the SMIv2 and support the
   Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.

Internet-Draft        TCs for Transport Addresses         September 2002


1. Introduction

   Several MIB modules need to represent transport-layer addresses in a
   generic way.  Typical examples are MIBs for application protocols
   that can operate over several different transports or application
   management MIBs that need to model generic communication endpoints.

   The SMIv2 defines in RFC 2579 [4] the textual conventions TDomain and
   TAddress to represent generic transports layer endpoints.  A generic
   TAddress value is interpreted in a given transport domain which is
   identified by a TDomain value.  The TDomain is an object identifier
   which allows MIB authors to extend the set of supported transport
   domains by providing suitable definitions in standardized or
   enterprise specific MIB modules.

   An initial set of TDomain values and concrete TAddress formats has
   been standardized in RFC 1906 [6].  These definitions are however
   mixed up with SNMP semantics.  Furthermore, definitions for Internet
   transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6 are missing.

   The purpose of this memo is to introduce a set of well-known textual
   conventions to represent commonly used transport-layer addressing
   information which is compatible with the original TDomain and
   TAddress approach and which includes definitions for additional
   Internet transport protocols over IPv4 and IPv6.  This memo also
   introduces a new textual convention which enumerates the well-known
   transport domains since such an enumeration provides in many cases
   sufficient flexibility and is more efficient compared to object
   identifiers.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT" and "MAY" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].

2. SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   o  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [2].

   o  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD
      16, RFC 1155 [12], STD 16, RFC 1212 [13] and RFC 1215 [14].  The
      second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 58, RFC 2578
      [3], STD 58, RFC 2579 [4] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [5].

   o  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The

      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [15].  A second version of the SNMP
      message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
      protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [16] and RFC
      1906 [6].  The third version of the message protocol is called
      SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [6], RFC 2572 [7] and RFC 2574
      [8].

   o  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [15].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [9].

   o  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [10] and
      the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575
      [11].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [17].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.

3. Overview

   This MIB module contains definitions for commonly used transport
   layer addressing information.  In particular, it provides the
   following definitions:

   1.  Textual conventions for generic transport addresses
       (TransportAddress) and generic transport domains
       (TransportDomain).

   2.  Object identifier registrations for well-known transport domains.

   3.  An enumeration of the well-known transport domains, called a

Internet-Draft        TCs for Transport Addresses         September 2002


       transport address type (TransportAddressType).

   4.  A set of textual conventions for the address formats used by
       well-known transport domains.  The DISPLAY-HINTs are aligned with
       the formats used in URIs [19], [20].

   The textual conventions for well-known transport domains support
   scoped Internet addresses.  The scope of an Internet address is a
   topological span within which the address may be used as a unique
   identifier for an interface or set of interfaces.  A scope zone, or a
   simply a zone, is a concrete connected region of topology of a given
   scope.  Note that a zone is a particular instance of a topological
   region, whereas a scope is the size of a topological region [18].
   Since Internet addresses on devices that connect multiple zones are
   not necessarily unique, an additional zone index is needed on these
   devices to select an interface.  The textual conventions
   TransportAddressIPv4z and TransportAddressIPv6z are provided to
   support Internet transport addresses which include a zone index.  In
   order to support arbitrary combinations of scoped Internet transport
   addresses, MIB authors SHOULD use a separate TransportDomain or
   TransportAddressType objects for each TransportAddress object.

   There are two different ways how new transport domains and textual
   conventions for the address formats used by those new transport
   domains can be defined.

   1.  The MIB module contained in this memo can be updated and new
       constants for the TransportDomain and the TransportAddressType
       enumeration can be assigned.

   2.  Other MIB modules may define additional transport domains and
       associated textual conventions.  Such an extension can not update
       the TransportAddressType enumeration.

   It is therefore a MIB designers choice whether he uses (a) a more
   compact TransportAddressType object with limited extensibility or (b)
   a more verbose TransportDomain object which allows arbitrary
   extensions in other MIB modules.

   The MIB module contained in this memo does NOT define the transport
   mappings of any particular protocol.  Rather, it defines a set of
   common identifiers and textual conventions that are intended to be
   used within various transport mappings documents.

3.1 Relationship to Other MIBs

   This section discusses how the definitions provided by the MIB module
   contained in this memo relate to definitions in other MIB modules.

3.1.1 SNMPv2-TC (TAddress, TDomain)

   The SNMPv2-TC MIB module [4] defines the textual conventions TAddress
   and TDomain to represent generic transport addresses.

   A TAddress is an octet string with a size between 1 and 255 octets.
   Experience has shown that there is sometimes a need to represent
   unknown transport addresses.  The MIB module contained in this memo
   therefore introduces a new textual convention TransportAddress which
   is an octet string with a size between 0 and 255 octets and otherwise
   identical semantics.  In other words, the sub-type TransportAddress
   (SIZE (1..255)) is identical with the TAddress defined in the SNMPv2-
   TC MIB module [4].

   This MIB module also introduces a new textual convention
   TransportDomain which is compatible with the TDomain definition so
   that a complete set of definitions is contained in a single MIB
   module.  New MIB modules SHOULD use the generic TransportDomain,
   TransportAddressType and TransportAddress definitions defined in this
   memo.  Existing MIB modules may be updated to use the definitions
   provided in this memo by replacing TDomain with TransportDomain and
   TAddress with TransportAddress (SIZE (1..255)).

3.1.2 SNMPv2-TM

   The transport domain values defined in the SNMPv2-TM MIB module [6]
   all contain "snmp" as the prefix in their name and are registered
   under `snmpDomains' (from RFC 2578 [3]).  They were originally
   intended to describe SNMP transport domains only - but they were
   later also used for non-SNMP transport endpoints.  These definitions
   are also incomplete since new transport address domains are needed to
   support (at least) SNMP over UDP over IPv6.

   The transport domain values defined in this memo are independent of
   the protocol running over the transport-layer and SHOULD be used for
   all transport endpoints not carrying SNMP traffic.  Programs that
   interpret transport domain values should in addition accept the
   transport domain values defined in the SNMPv2-TM MIB module in order
   to provide interoperability with existing implementations that use
   the SNMP specific transport domain values.

   Transport endpoints which carry SNMP traffic SHOULD continue to use
   the definitions from the SNMPv2-TM MIB module where applicable.  They
   SHOULD use the transport domain values defined in this memo for SNMP
   transports not defined in the SNMPv2-TM MIB module, such as SNMP over
   UDP over IPv6.  Programs that interpret transport domain values
   should in addition accept all the transport domain values defined in
   this memo in order to provide interoperability in cases where it is

   not possible or desirable to distinguish the protocols running over a
   transport endpoint.

3.1.3 INET-ADDRESS-MIB (InetAddressType, InetAddress)

   The INET-ADDRESS-MIB MIB module [21] defines the textual conventions
   InetAddressType and InetAddress to represent Internet network layer
   endpoints.  Some MIB modules use these textual conventions in
   conjunction with the InetPortNumber textual convention to represent
   Internet transport-layer endpoints.  This approach is fine as long as
   a MIB models protocols or applications that are specific to the
   Internet suite of transport protocols.  For protocols or applications
   that can potentially use other transport protocols, the use of the
   definitions contained in this memo is more appropriate.

            unwieldy (for example, when used as an index).

            The usage of this textual convention implies that additional
            transport domains can only be supported by updating this MIB
            module. This extensibility restriction does not apply for the
            TransportDomain textual convention which allows MIB authors
            to define additional transport domains independently in
            other MIB modules."

   TransportAddress ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
       STATUS      current
       DESCRIPTION
           "Denotes a generic transport address.

            A TransportAddress value is always interpreted within the
            context of a TransportAddressType or TransportDomain value.
            Every usage of the TransportAddress textual convention MUST
            specify the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain object
            which provides the context. Furthermore, MIB authors SHOULD
            define a separate TransportAddressType or TransportDomain
            object for each TransportAddress object. It is suggested that
            the TransportAddressType or TransportDomain is logically
            registered before the object(s) which use the
            TransportAddress textual convention if they appear in the
            same logical row.

            The value of a TransportAddress object must always be
            consistent with the value of the associated
            TransportAddressType or TransportDomain object. Attempts
            to set a TransportAddress object to a value which is
            inconsistent with the associated TransportAddressType or
            TransportDomain must fail with an inconsistentValue error.

            When this textual convention is used as a syntax of an
            index object, there may be issues with the limit of 128
            sub-identifiers specified in SMIv2, STD 58. In this case,
            the OBJECT-TYPE declaration MUST include a 'SIZE' clause
            to limit the number of potential instance sub-identifiers."

6. Security Considerations

   The MIB module contained in this memo does not define any management
   objects.  Instead, it defines a set of textual conventions which may
   be used by other MIB modules to define management objects.

   Meaningful security considerations can only be written for MIB
   modules that define concrete management objects.  This document has
   therefore no impact on the security of the Internet.
