1.  Introduction

   Ethernet MPLS VPN (EVPN) [RFC7432] is an emerging technology that is
   gaining prominence in Internet Service Provider IP/MPLS networks.  In
   EVPN, mac addresses are disseminated as routes across the
   geographical area via the Border Gateway Protocol, BGP [RFC4271]
   using the familiar L3VPN model [RFC4364].  An EVPN instance that
   spans across PEs is defined as an EVI.  Constrained Route
   Distribution [RFC4684] can be used in conjunction to selectively
   advertise the routes to where they are needed.  One of the major
   advantages of EVPN over VPLS [RFC4761],[RFC6624] is that it provides
   a solution for minimizing flooding of unknown traffic and also
   provides all Active mode of operation so that the traffic can truly
   be multi-homed.  In technologies such as EVPN or VPLS, managing
   Broadcast, Unknown Unicast and multicast traffic (BUM) is a key
   requirement.  In the case where the customer edge (CE) router is
   multi-homed to one or more Provider Edge (PE) Routers, it is
   necessary that one and only one of the PE routers should forward BUM
   traffic into the core or towards the CE as and when appropriate.

   Specifically, quoting Section 8.5, [RFC7432], Consider a CE that is a
   host or a router that is multi-homed directly to more than one PE in

   an EVPN instance on a given Ethernet segment.  One or more Ethernet
   Tags may be configured on the Ethernet segment.  In this scenario
   only one of the PEs, referred to as the Designated Forwarder (DF), is
   responsible for certain actions:

   a.  Sending multicast and broadcast traffic, on a given Ethernet Tag
       on a particular Ethernet segment, to the CE.

   b.  Flooding unknown unicast traffic (i.e. traffic for which an PE
       does not know the destination MAC address), on a given Ethernet
       Tag on a particular Ethernet segment to the CE, if the
       environment requires flooding of unknown unicast traffic.

                                 Figure 1

   Figure 1 illustrates a case where there are two Ethernet Segments,
   ES1 and ES2.  PE1 is attached to CE1 via Ethernet Segment ES1 whereas
   PE2, PE3 and PE4 are attached to CE2 via ES2 i.e. PE2, PE3 and PE4
   form a redundancy group.  Since CE2 is multi-homed to different PEs
   on the same Ethernet Segment, it is necessary for PE2, PE3 and PE4 to
   agree on a DF to satisfy the above mentioned requirements.

   Layer2 devices are particularly susceptible to forwarding loops
   because of the broadcast nature of the Ethernet traffic.  Therefore

Internet-Draft   An Improved EVPN DF Election Algorithm     October 2015


   it is very important that in case of multi-homing, only one of the
   links be used to direct traffic to/from the core.

   One of the pre-requisites for this support is that participating PEs
   must agree amongst themselves as to who would act as the Designated
   Forwarder.  This needs to be achieved through a distributed algorithm
   in which each participating PE independently and unambiguously
   selects one of the participating PEs as the DF, and the result should
   be unanimously in agreement.

   The DF election algorithm as described in [RFC7432] has some
   undesirable properties and in some cases can be somewhat disruptive
   and unfair.  This document describes those issues and proposes a
   mechanism for dealing with those issues.  These mechanisms do involve
   changes to the DF Election algorithm , but do not require any
   protocol changes to the EVPN Route exchange and have minimal changes
   to their content per se.

1.1.  Finite State Machine

   Since the specification in EVPN RFC [RFC7432] does leave several
   questions open as to the precise final state machine behavior of the
   DF election, the document also includes a section describing
   precisely the intended behavior.  The finite state machine is
   presented in Section 7.1

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  The modulus based DF Election Algorithm

   The default procedure for DF election at the granularity of (ESI,EVI)
   is referred to as "service carving".  With service carving, it is
   possible to elect multiple DFs per Ethernet Segment (one per EVI) in
   order to perform load-balancing of multi-destination traffic destined
   to a given Segment.  The objective is that the load-balancing
   procedures should carve up the EVI space among the redundant PE nodes
   evenly, in such a way that every PE is the DF for a disjoint set of
   EVIs.

   The existing DF algorithm as described in the EVPN RFC(Section 8.5
   [RFC7432]) is based on a modulus operation.  The PEs to which the ES
   (for which DF election is to be carried out per vlan) is multi-homed
   from an ordered (ordinal) list in ascending order of the PE ip
   address values.  Say, there are N PEs, P0, P1, ... PN-1 ranked as per



Mohanty, et al.          Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft   An Improved EVPN DF Election Algorithm     October 2015


   increasing IP addresses in the ordinal list; then for each vlan with
   ethernet tag v, configured on the ethernet segment ES1, PEx is the DF
   for vlan v on ES ES1 when x equals (v mod N).  In the case of VLAN
   bundle only the lowest VLAN is used.  In the case when the vlan
   density is high meaning there are significant number of vlans and the
   vlan-id or ethernet-tag is uniformly distributed, the thinking is
   that the DF election will be spread across the PEs hosting that
   ethernet segment and good service carving can be achieved.

3.  Problems with the modulus based DF Election Algorithm

   There are three fundamental problems with the current DF Election.

      First, the algorithm will not perform well when the ethernet tag
      follows a non-uniform distribution, for instance when the ethernet
      tags are all even or all odd.  In such a case let us assume that
      the ES is multi-homed to two PEs; all the vlans will only pick one
      of the PEs as the DF.  This is very sub-optimal.  It defeats the
      purpose of service carving as the DFs are not really evenly spread
      across.  In this particular case, in fact one of the PEs does not
      get elected all as the DF, so it does not participate in the DF
      responsibilities at all.  Consider another example where referring
      to Figure 1, lets assume that PE2, PE3, PE4 are in ascending order
      of the IP address; and each vlan configured on ES2 is associated
      with an Ethernet Tag of of the form (3x+1), where x is an integer.
      This will result in PE3 always be selected as the DF.

      Even in the case when the ethernet tag distribution is uniform the
      instance of a PE being up or down results in re-computation ((v
      mod N-1) or (v mod N+1) as is the case); The resulting modulus
      value need not be uniformly distributed but subject to the
      primality of N-1 or N+1 as may be the case.

      The third problem is one of disruption.  Consider a case when the
      same Ethernet Segment is multi homed to a set of PEs.  When the ES
      is down in one of the PEs, say PE1, or PE1 itself reboots, or the
      BGP process goes down or the connectivity between PE1 and an RR
      goes down, the effective number of PEs in the system now becomes
      N-1 and DFs are computed for all the vlans that are configured on
      that ethernet segment.  In general, if the DF for a vlan v happens
      not to be PE1, but some other PE, say PE2, it is likely that some
      other PE will become the new DF.  This is not desirable.
      Similarly when a new PE hosts the same Ethernet segment, the
      mapping again changes because of the mod operation.  This results
      in needless churn.  Again referring to Figure 1, say v1, v2 and v3
      are vlans configured on ES2 with associated ethernet tags of value
      999, 1000 and 10001 respectively.  So PE1, PE2 and PE3 are also




Mohanty, et al.          Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft   An Improved EVPN DF Election Algorithm     October 2015


      the DFs for v1, v2 and v3 respectively.  Now when PE3 goes down,
      PE2 will become the DF for v1 and PE1 will become the DF for v2.

   One point to note is that the current DF election algorithm assumes
   that all the PEs who are multi-homed to the same Ethernet Segment and
   interested in the DF Election by exchanging EVPN routes have a V4
   peering with each other or via a Route Reflector.  This need not be
   the case as there can be a v6 peering and supporting the EVPN
   address-family.

   Mathematically, a conventional hash function maps a key k to a number
   i representing one of m hash buckets through a function h(k) i.e.
   i=h(k).  In the EVPN case, h is simply a modulo-m hash function viz.
   h(v) = v mod N, where N is the number of PEs that are multi-homed to
   the Ethernet Segment in discussion.  It is well-known that for good
   hash distribution using the modulus operation, the modulus N should
   be a prime-number not too close to a power of 2 [CLRS2009].  When the
   effective number of PEs changes from N to N-1 (or vice versa); all
   the objects (vlan v) will be remapped except those for which v mod N
   and v mod (N-1) refer to the same PE in the previous and subsequent
   ordinal rankings respectively.

   From a forwarding perspective, this is a churn, as it results in
   programming the CE and PE side ports as blocking or non-blocking at
   potentially all PEs when the DF changes either because (i) a new PE
   is added or (ii) another one goes down or loses connectivity or else
   cannot take part in the DF election process for whatever reason.
   This draft addresses this problem and furnishes a solution to this
   undesirable behavior.

4.  Highest Random Weight

   Highest Random Weight (HRW) as defined in [HRW1999] is originally
   proposed in the context of Internet Caching and proxy Server load
   balancing.  Given an object name and a set of servers, HRW maps a
   request to a server using the object-name (object-id) and server-name
   (server-id) rather than the state of the server states.  HRW forms a
   hash out of the server-id and the object-id and forms an ordered list
   of the servers for the particular object-id.  The server for which
   the hash value is highest, serves as the primary responsible for that
   particular object, and the server with the next highest value in that
   hash serves as the backup server.  HRW always maps a given object
   object name to the same server within a given cluster; consequently
   it can be used at client sites to achieve global consensus on object-
   server mappings.  When that server goes down, the backup server
   becomes the responsible designate.





Mohanty, et al.          Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   An Improved EVPN DF Election Algorithm     October 2015


   Choosing an appropriate hash function that is statistically oblivious
   to the key distribution and imparts a good uniform distribution of
   the hash output is an important aspect of the algorithm,. Fortunately
   many such hash functions exist.  [HRW1999] provides pseudorandom
   functions based on Unix utilities rand and srand and easily
   constructed XOR functions that perform considerably well.  This
   imparts very good properties in the load balancing context.  Also
   each server independently and unambiguously arrives at the primary
   server selection.  HRW already finds use in multicast and ECMP
   [RFC2991],[RFC2992].

   In the existing DF algorithm Section 2, whenever a new PE comes up or
   an existing PE goes down, there is a significant interval before the
   change is noticed by all peer PEs as it has to be conveyed by the BGP
   update message involving the type-4 route.  There is a timer to batch
   all the messages before triggering the service carving procedures.
   When the timer expires, each PE will build the ordered list and
   follow the procedures for DF Election.  In the proposed method which
   we will describe shortly this "jittered" behavior is retained.

5.  HRW and Consistent Hashing

   HRW is not the only algorithm that addresses the object to server
   mapping problem with goals of fair load distribution, redundancy and
   fast access.  There is another family of algorithms that also
   addresses this problem; these fall under the umbrella of the
   Consistent Hashing Algorithms [CHASH].  These will not be considered
   here.

6.  HRW Algorithm for EVPN DF Election

   The applicability of HRW to DF Election can be described here.  Let
   DF(v) denote the Designated Forwarder and BDF(v) the Backup
   Designated forwarder for the ethernet tag V, where v is the vlan, Si
   is the IP address of server i and weight is a pseudorandom function
   of v and Si.  In case of a vlan bundle service, v denotes the lowest
   vlan similar to the 'lowest vlan in bundle' logic of [RFC7432].

   1.  DF(v) = Si: Weight(v, Si) >= Weight(V, Sj) , for all j.  In case
       of a tie, choose the PE whose IP address is numerically the
       least.

   2.  BDF(v) = Sk: Weight(v, Si) >= Weight(V, Sk) and Weight(v, Sk) >=
       Weight(v, Sj). in case of tie choose the PE whose IP address is
       numerically the least.

   Since the Weight is a Pseudorandom function with domain as a
   concatenation of (v, S), it is an efficient deterministic algorithm



Mohanty, et al.          Expires April 21, 2016                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft   An Improved EVPN DF Election Algorithm     October 2015


   which is independent of the Ethernet Tag V sample space distribution.
   Choosing a good hash function for the pseudorandom function is an
   important consideration for this algorithm to perform provably better
   than the existing algorithm.  As mentioned previously, such functions
   are described in the HRW paper.  We take as candidate hash functions
   two of the ones that are preferred in [HRW1999].

   1.  Wrand(v, Si) = (1103515245((1103515245.Si+12345)XOR
       D(v))+12345)(mod 2^31) and

   2.  Wrand2(v, Si) = (1103515245((1103515245.D(v)+12345)XOR
       Si)+12345)(mod 2^31)

   Here D(v) is the 31-bit digest of the ethernet-tag v and Si is
   address of the ith server.  The server's IP address length does not
   matter as only the low-order 31 bits are modulo significant.
   Eventually we plan to choose one of the two candidate hash functions
   as the preferred one.

   A point to note is that the the domain of the Weight function is a
   concatenation of the ethernet-tag and the PE IP-address, and the
   actual length of the server IP address (whether V4 or V6) is not
   really relevant, so long as the actual hash algorithm takes into
   consideration the concatenated string.  The existing algorithm in
   [RFC7432] as is cannot employ both V4 and V6 neighbor peering
   address.

   HRW solves the disadvantage pointed out in Section 3 and ensures

   o  with very high probability that the task of DF election for
      respective vlans is more or less equally distributed among the PEs
      even for the 2 PE case

   o  If a PE, hosting some vlans on given ES, but is neither the DF nor
      the BDF for that vlan, goes down or its connection to the ES goes
      down, it does not result in a DF and BDF reassignment the other
      PEs.  This saves computation, especially in the case when the
      connection flaps.

   o  More importantly it avoids the needless disruption case (c) that
      are inherent in the existing modulus based algorithm

   o  In addition to the DF, the algorithm also furnishes the BDF, which
      would be the DF if the current DF fails.

7.  Protocol Considerations

   Note that for the DF election procedures to be globally convergent
   and unanimous, it is necessary that all the participating PEs agree
   on the DF Election algorithm to be used.  It is not possible that
   some PEs continue to use the existing modulus based DF election and
   some newer PEs use the HRW.  For brownfield deployments and for
   interoperability with legacy boxes, its is important that all PEs
   need to have the capability to fall back on the modulus algorithm.  A
   PE (one with a newer version of the software) can indicate its
   willingness to support HRW by signaling a new extended community
   along with the Ethernet-Segment Route (Type-4).  This extended
   community is explained in the next paragraph.  When a PE receives the
   Ethernet-Segment Routes from all the other PEs for the ethernet
   segment in question, it checks to see if all the advertisements have
   the extended community attached; in the case that they do, this
   particular PE, and by induction all the other PEs proceed to do DF
   Election as per the HRW Algorithm.  Otherwise if even a single
   advertisement for the type-4 route is not received with the extended
   community or the received DF types (including locally configured
   type) do not ALL match a single value, the default modulus algorithm
   is used as before.  Also, the HRW algorithm needs to be executed
   after the "batching" time.

   A new BGP extended community attribute [RFC4360] needs to be defined
   to identify the DF election procedure to be used for the Ethernet
   Segment.  We propose to name this extended community as the DF
   Election Extended Community.  It is a new transitive extended
   community where the Type field is 0x06, and the Sub-Type is to be
   defined.  It may be advertised along with Ethernet Segment routes.

7.1.  Finite State Machine

   Per [RFC7432], the FSM described in Figure 3 is executed per ESI/VLAN
   in case of VLAN aware service or ESI/[VLANs in VLAN Bundle] in case
   of VLAN Bundle on each participating PE.

   Observe that currently the VLANs are derived from local configuration
   and the FSM does not provide any protection against misconfiguration
   where same EVI,ESI combination has different set of VLANs on
   different participating PEs or one of the PEs elects to consider
   VLANs as VLAN bundle and another as separate VLANs for election
   purposes (service type mismatch).

   The FSM is normative in the sense that any design or implementation
   MUST behave towards external peers and as observable external
   behavior (DF) in a manner equivalent to this FSM.

   States:

   1.  INIT: Initial State

   2.  DF WAIT: State in which the participants waits for enough
       information to perform the DF election for the EVI/ESI/VLAN
       combination.

   3.  DF CALC: State in which the new DF is recomputed.

   4.  DF DONE: State in which the according DF for the EVI/ESI/VLAN
       combination has been elected.



   Events:

   1.  ES_UP: The ESI has been locally configured as 'up'.

   2.  ES_DOWN: The ESI has been locally configured as 'down'.

   3.  VLAN_CHANGE: The VLANs configured in a bundle that uses the ESI
       changed.  This event is necessary for VLAN bundles only.

   4.  DF_TIMER: DF Wait timer has expired.

   5.  RCVD_ES: A new or changed Ethernet Segment Route is received in a
       BGP REACH UPDATE.  Receiving an unchanged UPDATE MUST NOT trigger
       this event.

   6.  LOST_ES: A BGP UNREACH UPDATE for a previously received Ethernet
       Segment route has been received.  If an UNREACH is seen for a
       route that has not been advertised previously, the event MUST NOT
       be triggered.

   7.  CALCULATED: DF has been succesfully calculated.



   According actions when transitions are performed or states entered/
   exited:

   1.   ANY STATE on ES_DOWN: (i)stop DF timer (ii) assume non-DF for
        local PE

   2.   INIT on ES_UP: (i)do nothing

   3.   INIT on RCVD_ES, LOST_ES: (i)do nothing

Internet-Draft   An Improved EVPN DF Election Algorithm     October 2015


   4.   DF_WAIT on entering the state: (i) start DF timer if not started
        already or expired (ii) assume non-DF for local PE

   5.   DF_WAIT on RCVD_ES, LOST_ES: do nothing

   6.   DF_WAIT on DF_TIMER: do nothing

   7.   DF_CALC on entering or re-entering the state: (i) rebuild
        according list and hashes and perform election (ii) FSM
        generates CALCULATED event against itself

   8.   DF_CALC on LOST_ES or VLAN_CHANGE: do nothing

   9.   DF_CALC on RCVD_ES: do nothing

   10.  DF_CALC on CALCULATED: (i) mark election result for VLAN or
        bundle

   11.  DF_DONE on exiting the state: (i)if RFC7432 election or new
        election and lost primary DF then assume non-DF for local PE for
        VLAN or VLAN bundle.

   12.  DF_DONE on VLAN_CHANGE or LOST_ES: do nothing



8.  Auto-Derivation of ES-Import Route Target

   Section 7.6 of RFC7432 describes how the value of the ES-Import Route
   Target for ESI types 1, 2, and 3 can be auto-derived by using the
   high-order six bytes of the nine byte ESI value.  This document
   extends the same auto-derivation procedure to ESI types 0, 4, and 5.

9.  Operational Considerations

   TBD.

10.  Security Considerations

   This document raises no new security issues for EVPN.

11.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank Tamas Mondal, Sami Boutros, Jakob
   Heitz, Jorge Rabadan and Patrice Brissette for useful feedback and
   discussions.
