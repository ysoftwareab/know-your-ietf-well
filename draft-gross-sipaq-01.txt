Abstract 
    
   This document specifies the architecture, protocols and messages for 
   SIP based IP communications between Internet domains in support of 
   QoS and AAA. Detailed message flows and message contents are 
   discussed and specified. AAA requirements including inter-domain and 
   user authorization in mobile and non-mobile environments are 
   addressed. A solution is proposed where session setup and teardown 
   are linked with QoS and AAA signaling using AAA policy servers and 
   clearinghouses.

Internet Draft    QoS AAA SIP Based IP Communication        April 2001 
 
 
1. Introduction 
    
   Commercial grade IP communications may require voice and other media 
   transport of equal or higher quality than present 3.1 kHz circuit 
   switched voice. Conversely, lower media quality may be acceptable in 
   cases where other service advantages exist, similar to wireless 
   audio/video streaming. 
    
   We focus here on those circumstances where voice and other media 
   quality are important and require end-to-end network resources for 
   QoS with larger bandwidth and/or lower delay. Dynamic setup of end-
   to-end network resources for QoS requires highly scalable mechanisms 
   to authenticate, authorize and account (AAA) for network resources 
   across the Internet. This must be able to happen between a very 
   large number of independent and various access domains that may have 
   no business or trust relationship with each other, or may not even 
   know of each other's existence before initiating end-to-end 
   communications. 
    
   The term IP communications is used here for a large class of new 
   communications enabled by IP and the Internet such as presence, 
   instant text, voice or multimedia conferences, the integration of 
   messaging and real time communications, the integration of 
   communications in productivity software, with transactions, games, 
   entertainment and other. Not all IP communication services can be 
   extended to other networks, such as PSTN, ISDN, H.323, BICC or the 
   so-called "softswitch" networks that use MEGACO or similar master-
   slave signaling protocols. 
    
   AAA services are important because QoS and IP to PLMN and PSTN 
   termination through gateways are services that are billable. 
   Unauthorized users should be prevented from using these services and 
   service providers should be able to appropriately bill authorized 
   users. 
    
   This document specifies the architecture, protocols and messages for 
   SIP based IP communications between Internet domains in support of 
   QoS and AAA [1]. It builds on information presented in [2] and [3] 
   and is inline with the AAA framework and architecture of [4] and 
   [5]. This document discusses AAA requirements including inter-domain 
   and user authorization in mobile and non-mobile environments. One 
   AAA solution is proposed. The developments in this document assume 2 
   party call control only. The term originator implies a user who 
   initiates and participates in the IP communication session. 
    
2. Terminology 
    
   This section defines terms used throughout this document. Some of 
   these terms may have other meanings outside the context of this 
   work. Their outside meanings are not guaranteed to coincide with the 
   definitions given here.

   APS: AAA and Policy Server. The APS acts as a policy decision point, 
        PDP, for network usage related policies, including IP telephony 
        and QoS requests such as bandwidth reservation. The APS acts on 
        service requests, such as SIP INVITEs for calls requiring QoS 
        and possibly outsources requests to other PDPs, such as a DIR, 
        ADB, or CH. The APS renders a decision and may then apply 
        policy to network elements. 
    
   CH:  Clearinghouse. The CH authorizes inter-domain calls with QoS 
        and collects usage reports for settlement between service 
        providers. 
    
   DIR: Directory. The DIR is the source for end user names and their 
        services. A DIR has the list of all individual users and some 
        attributes that the APS may use as criteria for policy 
        decisions on an individual basis. 
    
   ADB: Accounts Database. The ADB is part of the "back office" of the 
        service provider. The ADB contains a list of all corporate 
        accounts and the respective service level specifications that 
        apply at the edges of their networks. It may have classes of 
        policies or customized policies for various corporate accounts. 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [6]. 
    
3. Overview 
    
   The components involved in AAA and QoS enabled IP communication 
   sessions are shown in Figure 1. SP represents a SIP Proxy. The 
   clearinghouse (CH) exists outside the access domains and is 
   responsible for providing inter-domain AAA services. In some cases a 
   customer APS may exist outside the access domain. One such case may 
   be where the customer has his or her own corporate domain with a 
   corresponding corporate APS. 
    
   Routers internal to the domain are labeled "R" and the edge router 
   is labeled "ER". The media agent, "MA", is the application that 
   sends/receives telephony/multimedia session data. The ER may be 
   responsible for aggregating RSVP flows into appropriate Diffserv 
   classes. 
    
   All developments discussed in this document apply using SIP for 
   setting up IP communications. Other signaling means such as H.323, 
   MEGACO or related protocols, may have a different structure in the 
   dependency between signaling, QoS setup and AAA and are therefore 
   not the object of this draft. 
    
   The SIP User Agent, SIP UA, acts as client and server on behalf of 
   the user. If an IP phone originated the session, the SIP UA resides 
   on the IP phone. If the signal entering the access domain came 
   directly from a gateway, the SIP UA may reside in the access domain,

   as shown in the figure. In any case, the specific details of this 
   configuration are not relevant to the development in this document. 
    
   The large box in Figure 1 is labeled as an ISP. In general, it may 
   be an enterprise domain. Additionally, an enterprise domain may 
   outsource SIP services to an ISP. In that case, both domains may be 
   shown in the figure. For simplicity, Figure 1 is shown with a single 
   domain.

   Figure 1: Components to Support Inter-domain AAA QoS Services 
    
   The SIP proxy acts as a policy enforcement point, PEP, for IP 
   communication sessions that use SIP. An extension to COPS has been 
   defined that outlines the syntax and semantics of COPS messages and 
   COPS objects for use with SIP [7]. The APS is the corresponding 
   policy decision point, PDP, for SIP sessions. The APS may also 
   interact with the DIR, ADB, customer APS, an APS from other domains 
   and/or one or more clearinghouses for information on which to base a 
   service usage decision. If QoS is requested and granted, the APS may 
   also interact with applicable network device(s) to aid in QoS setup. 
    
   Clearinghouses are used to provide scalable, inter-domain AAA 
   services. One or more clearinghouses may be involved in an IP 
   communications session. Network devices along the session data path 
   use one or more QoS mechanisms to provide a user specified level of 
   service. RSVP [8] may be one such QoS mechanism in access networks 
   and Diffserv [9] may be a QoS mechanism in the transit network.

   Internal routers may or may not participate in bandwidth 
   reservation. If it can be assumed that internal routers are not 
   bottlenecks and will always have sufficient resources to handle 
   requests without reservations, message exchanges with the APS may be 
   eliminated. In this case, the slanted line connecting the APS with R 
   in Figure 1 may be ignored. 
    
4. Authorization and Authentication 
    
   Proper authorization and authentication may be accomplished in a 
   variety of ways. In pursuit of the most suitable technique, various 
   factors must be considered. These factors include: 
    
   1) minimizing call setup time 
   2) minimizing the time and occurrences that authorization 
      tokens/messages are placed on the wire 
   3) minimizing implementation complexity 
   4) optimization of business relationship models (use of 
      clearinghouses as opposed to many bi-lateral agreements). 
    
   With these factors in mind, this document discusses some of the 
   requirements of authorization and authentication and suggests one 
   technique as a solution. 
    
   Requirements of authorization and authentication include: 
    
   1) user authorization 
   2) inter-domain authorization 
    
   In this document, user authorization is taken for granted when the 
   session originator is in his/her home domain. This scenario is 
   discussed in the first sub-section below. When the session 
   originator roams into a foreign domain, or another session 
   participant roams into a foreign domain, user authorization is 
   necessary. Foreign domains are referred to as visited domains in 
   this document. This scenario is considered in the second sub-section 
   below. 
    
   While roaming, user registration is assumed to occur before an IP 
   communication session is initiated [10]. During the user 
   registration process, relevant information is exchanged between the 
   roaming user and the visited domain. This information includes the 
   roaming users home domain. The registration process may use the AAA 
   infrastructure described in this document. Further details 
   concerning user registration are out of the scope of this document. 
    
   The solution suggested within this document to handle AAA 
   requirements in QoS enabled IP communication sessions includes the 
   use of one or more authorization tokens and clearinghouses. This 
   solution makes every attempt to address the factors listed 
   previously to provide the most suitable solution.

Internet Draft    QoS AAA SIP Based IP Communication        April 2001 
 
 
   The methods described in this document use the IP communication 
   session setup protocol, such as SIP, to transport authorization 
   tokens. An alternative approach is to pass authorization tokens 
   between the AAA/Policy servers directly. The second approach may 
   have operational advantages but would require substantially more 
   development before an implementation could be realized. Development 
   along these lines has begun and is discussed in [4] and [5]. 
    
   Although accounting is not discussed in this section, it is an 
   implied necessity. IP communication sessions must trigger the 
   submission of usage indications or reports after session completion. 
   This facilitates correct accounting. 
    
4.1. Inter-domain 
    
   Assume Domain 1, D1, and Domain 2, D2, register with Clearinghouse x 
   (CHx). The necessary security infrastructure is put in place between 
   CHx and D1 and CHx and D2. The security infrastructure must support 
   authentication and authorization services. In some situations it may 
   also be important to support a non-repudiation service to prevent 
   the false denial of IP communication services/resources. 
    
   Such an infrastructure can be supplied in the form of a public key 
   infrastructure, PKI, based system or a symmetric key based system 
   such as Kerberos. This infrastructure must be operational before the 
   services of CHx are available. If a PKI based system is used D1 may 
   register with CHx, and in the process exchange public key 
   certificates with CHx. CHx may then use the certificate from D1 to 
   authenticate that any message received from D1 actually came from 
   D1. Analogously, D1 may use the certificate from CHx to authenticate 
   that any message received from CHx actually came from CHx. This can 
   be facilitated by the built in security functionality of OSP [11]. 
    
   Authentication of the SIP proxy and all end users within a domain is 
   the responsibility of the domain administrator. Maintenance of 
   intra-domain security is required because CHx only authenticates D1 
   as a whole through the APS. Intra-domain authentication of users 
   requires another level of authentication not discussed in this 
   section. This level of authentication is an especially important 
   consideration for roaming users. 
    
   When an end host caller from D1, EH1, calls an end host callee in 
   D2, EH2, the APS in D1, APS1, requests an authorization token from 
   CHx to verify that an appropriate business relationship exists with 
   D2. This development is illustrated in Figure 2. The figure only 
   illustrates messaging that includes the authorization token. 
    
   If authorization is granted, CHx replies with an authorization token 
   to APS1. This token carries sufficient authentication information so 
   that D2 (and possibly CHx) can later verify that it was created by 
   CHx (or possibly another trusted CH) and not by a fraudulent source. 
   This is in addition to the digital signatures contained in the

   messages exchanged between CHx and APS1 used to authenticate 
   individual messages. 
    
   The APS1 may now authorize the call to the SIP proxy of D1, SP1. 
   APS1 may store the session source, destination, and media 
   information to aid in QoS setup. SP1 embeds the authorization token 
   in the SIP INVITE messages and forwards it to the SIP proxy of D2, 
   SP2. 
    
   Upon reception of the INVITE message, SP2 contacts APS2, passing it 
   the authorization token, to request local and inter-domain 
   authorization to complete session setup. Because the authorization 
   token contains self-authentication information, APS2 can 
   authenticate that CHx has actually authorized the incoming call. 
   This removes the requirement for APS2 to contact CHx.

     1) APS1 requests an auth token from CH, triggered by session 
        setup request from EH1 
     2) APS1 returns auth token to SP1 (SP1 embeds token in 
        session signaling message) 
     3) SP1 signals SP2 with embedded token 
     4) SP2 sends auth token to APS2 for authorization and 
        authentication 
     5) auth token no longer used, may be destroyed

   After EH1 and EH2 have been notified that the IP communication 
   session has been authorized, they may now proceed to reserve 
   bandwidth using a mechanism such as RSVP (mapped to Diffserv at the 
   domain egress routers). Bandwidth management services determine if 
   the requested bandwidth is available over the specified path.

   The originating and terminating domains have now completed proper 
   inter-domain authorization. If authorization was granted call setup 
   can complete and data may be exchanged over the reserved path. In 
   some models, pre-session establishment of QoS may be a requirement. 
   In such cases, completion of session setup may only transpire if QoS 
   has been established in the required direction(s) [2], [12]. In 
   other models, establishment of QoS and the IP communication session 
   may be decoupled, where each proceeds independently [2].

   Mobility of an end user demands additional infrastructure to 
   authenticate and authorize the user while roaming. Three or more 
   domains may be involved in the AAA and call setup process. The 
   visited domain may be defined as the domain that the user has roamed 
   into. The home domain may be defined as the domain where the user 
   maintains a user profile that contains, among other things, a list 
   of services for that user. The called domain is the domain in which 
   the called party is present. Note that in the general case, this may 
   not be the called party's home domain. That is, the called party may 
   also be roaming. An additional level of authorization and 
   authentication would be necessary in this case. For simplicity, this 
   document addresses the case where the called party is reached at his 
   or her home domain. 
    
   In general, authorization and authentication between domains is 
   necessary because billable QoS services may be requested along a 
   path between them. All service providers included in this path who 
   transmit the session data and provide the requested QoS services 
   will expect accounting and/or payment. 
    
   However, there is a distinction between the end domains where per 
   call accounting may be required and the transit networks that need 
   not be burdened with the knowledge or understanding of each 
   individual qos flow. For scalability, the transit networks will 
   group all qos flows in some Diffserv class of traffic. The 
   discussion that follows applies only to end domains where calls 
   originate and terminate. 
    
   Accounting agreements can be encompassed in a business relationship 
   with a clearinghouse. An authorization token can be used to verify 
   the business relationship between the visited domain and the 
   clearinghouse and the called domain and the clearinghouse. 
    
   A business relationship may also include roaming allowances and 
   services. This implies that a user who roams into a foreign domain 
   may proceed to use the IP communication services that he/she pays 
   for and normally receives from his/her home domain. An authorization 
   token can be used between the visited and home domains to verify 
   such a business relationship with a clearinghouse. Accounting, and 
   ultimately charging, is facilitated with the use of authorization 
   tokens to verify business agreements.

   In most cases, SIP signaling sessions which involve mobile SIP 
   terminals will be directed through the home domain of the mobile 
   user in order to maintain home control. Home control is important 
   for the execution of signaled services because the user then sees 
   the same services irrespective of the network capabilities of the 
   visited domain he/she has roamed into. These services are contained 
   in a user profile at the user's home domain. 
    
   The authorization tokens obtained from one or more clearinghouses 
   may be embedded in the SIP signaling during session establishment. 
   The order in which tokens are obtained is not clear at this time. 
   Also, the domain(s) that contact the clearinghouse(s) for 
   authorization token requests is not clear at this time. Two possible 
   scenarios are illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. We note that in each, 
   options exist concerning clearinghouse contacts and messaging order. 
    
   In Figure 3, session signaling (SIP INVITE message) arrives at the 
   SIP proxy of the visited domain (1). The SP, acting as a SIP PEP, 
   makes a request to the APS, acting as a SIP PDP (2). The APS of the 
   visited domain contacts one or more clearinghouses seeking 
   appropriate business relationships with the home and called domains 
   (3, 4). If all three domains are registered with the same 
   clearinghouse, only that clearinghouse need be contacted. The 
   clearinghouses return one or more authorization tokens to the APS, 
   which passes them back to the SP. The SP embeds the tokens within 
   the SIP INVITE message and forwards it to the home domain of the 
   caller (5).

   that the requested services are allowed. The APS verifies the 
   applicable authorization token and may make additional policy-based 
   admission decisions. The decision is passed back to the SP. The 
   INVITE message is then forwarded to the SP of the called domain (7). 
   The SP contacts the APS using a PEP/PDP relationship (8). The APS 
   verifies the applicable authorization token and may make additional 
   policy-based admission decisions. The decision is passed back to the 
   SP. The SP finally forwards the INVITE message to the called user, 
   SIP UA2 (9). 
    
   In Figure 4, the messaging is different only in one way. The APS of 
   the visited domain contacts the APS of the home domain before any 
   authorization tokens are obtained (3). The APS of the home domain 
   checks the user's profile to authorize the use of services. If the 
   home domain authorizes the session, the APS in the visited domain 
   receives a success reply and proceeds to obtain necessary 
   authorization tokens as described for Figure 3.

   The advantage of the scenario in Figure 4 is that the user's profile 
   is checked before any authorization tokens are obtained. In this 
   way, valuable airtime in the wireless case would not be wasted 
   transporting authorization tokens if the user's profile did not 
   allow the session to proceed. A disadvantage is that call setup time 
   may be lengthened somewhat due to an extra inter-domain message 
   exchange. Another disadvantage may be that a messaging protocol 
   between APSs would have to be defined. COPS is one protocol that may 
   be used for this interaction [13].

   The authorization tokens ensure that authentic, billable parties 
   exist and that account, billing and charge settlement may be 
   achieved in a previously agreed upon manner. To achieve scalability, 
   business relationships with a clearinghouse can be used to remove 
   the necessity for bi-lateral business agreements. 
    
5. Message Contents 
    
   This section defines the data content of messages passed between the 
   SIP proxies, APS, and clearinghouse to provide QoS and AAA linkage 
   with SIP for inter-domain IP communication sessions. The messaging 
   discussed does not consider mobility. It considers an originating 
   domain and a terminating domain, each containing a SIP UA, a SIP 
   proxy, and an APS, similar to the illustration in Figure 2. If 
   inter-domain authorization and gateway location services are not 
   required, interaction with a CH and inclusion of an authorization 
   token in all exchanges listed in this section can be ignored. 
    
   A companion document defines a COPS extension for SIP that details 
   the messaging and message contents between the SP and APS [7]. The 
   current document merely discusses this messaging in general terms. 
   Please refer to the referenced document for full details. 
    
5.1. SIP Proxy to APS (Originating Domain) 
    
   When a SIP proxy receives an INVITE, it sends source, destination, 
   and possibly media information to the APS. The source and 
   destination information may be used by the APS for intra-domain 
   policy-based admission authorization. Some or all of the information 
   must be sent to the CH for inter-domain authorization. 
    
   The SIP call identifier (callID) can be used by the APS for intra-
   domain accounting. The callID must be sent to the CH in the 
   authorization request message. The CH may use this identifier when 
   generating an authorization token. 
    
   If the INVITE contains a SDP attribute specifying bandwidth 
   reservation [12], the APS may need to know the amount of bandwidth 
   requested. The bandwidth is implied by the media description [14], 
   [15]. Bandwidth information is necessary if the APS is charged with 
   the responsibility of managing bandwidth allocation based on user 
   and application information. For example, the APS may have a policy 
   that allows user X to reserve 300 Kbps for multimedia sessions with 
   users A through E and only 50 Kbps multimedia sessions with other 
   users. 
    
5.2. APS to CH (from Originating Domain) 
    
   The information required by the CH for accurate AAA support may be 
   CH dependent. It is expected that all CHs require knowledge of the 
   source and destination domains for basic AAA purposes. The call 
   identifier may be useful for authorization token generation. 
   Bandwidth reservation amount may be required by a CH dependent on 
 
Gross et al.             Expires October 2001                [Page 12] 
Internet Draft    QoS AAA SIP Based IP Communication        April 2001 
 
 
   the specific business agreement with the domains. This quantity may 
   be used as a basis for granting or denying authorization. If 
   bandwidth reservation amount is required, it must be put into a form 
   agreed upon by the parties involved, such as bits per second. 
    
5.3. CH to APS (to Originating Domain) 
    
   The clearinghouse has the responsibility of making an authorization 
   decision concerning IP communication between the specified source 
   and destination domains. If gateway services are also requested, the 
   decision may also be based upon available gateways and subsequent 
   QoS or cost characteristics corresponding with that gateway. For 
   example, the business relationship of the end domains with the 
   clearinghouse may exclude IP communication sessions that incur costs 
   above a specific limit. Costs may result from long distance charges 
   over the PSTN or from bandwidth reservation over the IP network. The 
   location of a gateway will likely affect one or both of these costs. 
    
   The CH must return to the APS an authorization decision. If the 
   request is granted, the CH must also return to the APS an 
   authorization token. The authorization token is expected to contain 
   authentication information so that both end point domains recognize 
   it as coming from a trusted CH, as described in a previous section. 
   A unique transaction identifier may be returned by the CH and 
   subsequently used to correlate original authorization requests with 
   usage indication reports generated after the session has completed. 
    
5.4. APS to SIP Proxy (Originating Domain) 
    
   The APS finally responds to the SIP proxy INVITE message with a 
   status, indicating if the user is allowed to send the INVITE further 
   along the SIP signaling chain. If the authorization is granted, the 
   APS passes the authorization token it received from the CH to the 
   SIP proxy. The SIP proxy includes this token inside the 
   authorization token header field of the INVITE message [16]. 
    
5.5. SIP Proxy to SIP Proxy (Originating to Terminating Domain) 
    
   The SIP proxy forwards the INVITE message containing the 
   authorization token from the originating domain to the terminating 
   domain in the manner defined by SIP. 
    
5.6. SIP Proxy to APS (Terminating Domain) 
    
   The APS in the terminating domain requires the same information as 
   the APS in the originating domain on which to base an intra-domain 
   authorization decision. Additionally, if the APS receives an 
   authorization token, it performs an authentication check on it using 
   the security infrastructure previously established with the CH. This 
   action verifies that the authorization token is authentic and that 
   the requested service has been authorized by a trusted source. 
    
6. Protocol Support

   The exchange of information between the APS and the SIP proxy may be 
   handled using COPS. As mentioned previously, a new COPS extension 
   for SIP is being developed concurrently with this work [7]. 
   Exchanges between the APS and the CH can be handled using OSP [11]. 
   OSP defines all messaging and message data field specifications that 
   are outlined in this document. No additional protocol work is 
   required for this exchange. Also, OSP has been embraced and is in 
   use by a number of large industry participants. 
    
7. Messaging Overview 
    
   This section details the message exchange and message contents to 
   initiate and terminate a SIP-based IP multimedia session. Mobility 
   is not considered in this section. The caller and callee are both 
   present and active at their respective home domains. 
    
   It is assumed that the media will be transmitted and received from 
   both ends and that bandwidth reservation requests are made in both 
   directions using the SDP attributes discussed in [12]. In the first 
   subsection the inter-domain authorization occurs at the originating 
   domain. In the second subsection the inter-domain authorization 
   occurs at the terminating domain. 
    
   Descriptions of SIP messages, including requests and responses, are 
   not discussed in this document. They are discussed in detail in [1]. 
   Descriptions of RSVP messages are not discussed in this document but 
   are discussed in detail in [8]. It is assumed that edge routers are 
   RSVP enabled PEPs. Furthermore, it is assumed that the edge routers 
   interact with the APS as PDPs of their respective domains for
   policy-based management decisions concerning RSVP. Message exchanges 
   of this nature are assumed implicit in this section and are not 
   included in the messaging overview. Details concerning this message 
   exchange are in [17]. 
    
   As discussed in [2], two QoS models may be defined for IP 
   communication sessions. The QoS assured model is one in which the 
   session and QoS signaling are coupled. In this case the session does 
   not proceed until/unless QoS has been successfully established. The 
   QoS enabled model decouples session and QoS signaling. In this case, 
   the session setup may complete and session data may be exchanged 
   even if QoS has not yet been, or never gets, established. The 
   messaging discussed in this document only considers the QoS enabled 
   model. The development in this section may be extended to work with 
   the QoS enabled model with the inclusion of messages defined in [12] 
   and [18]. 
    
   Since QoS assured is assumed in the session flow examples, the RSVP 
   and SIP messaging are decoupled and may occur asynchronously. The 
   SIP, COPS and OSP messages outlined in the call flow examples may 
   therefore not necessarily be in chronological order with the RSVP 
   messages. 
    
 
Gross et al.             Expires October 2001                [Page 14]

   In the following call flows, the APS of the respective domain may be 
   contacted for a policy based decision whenever new session data 
   arrives. The SIP protocol defines whether session data may be 
   transmitted in INVITE, ACK and/or response messages. For simplicity, 
   the call flows in this document assume that session data is 
   transmitted in INVITE and 200 OK responses. 
    
   All components involved in message passing are illustrated in Figure 
   1. Those in the originating domain are subscripted with "o" and 
   components in the terminating domain are subscripted with "t". The 
   protocol used for each exchange is indicated at each step. Each step 
   also contains notes concerning the contents or special attributes of 
   the message. 
    
7.1. Originating Domain Contacts Clearinghouse 
    
   The following discussion refers to Figures 5 and 6. The step numbers 
   of Figure 5 are indicated as message labels in Figure 6. In step 1, 
   the caller picks up the phone, requests a bandwidth reserved 
   connection and dials a number. This causes the UAo to include 
   appropriate SDP attributes in the SIP INVITE message indicating that 
   QoS is being requested in both directions. The necessary information 
   is passed from the SPo to APSo in step 2. APSo checks if local 
   policy allows the call. This may include interaction with an 
   external policy database, a DIR, an ADB, and/or another APS. 
    
   If local policy authorizes the call, APSo sends the CH an 
   authorization request for inter-domain authorization in step 3. The 
   CH considers the source and destination information to determine if 
   appropriate business relationships exist with the originating and 
   terminating domains. Bandwidth and/or media information may also be 
   used on which to base a decision. If authorization is granted, the 
   CH generates an authorization token using the call identifier as 
   well as other data. The CH sends the token to the APSo in step 4 
   along with a status value indicating if authorization has been 
   granted or not. The APSo passes this information on to the SPo in 
   step 5. 
    
   The SPo forwards the INVITE with the embedded authorization token 
   down the SIP signaling chain in step 6 to SPt in the terminating 
   domain. The SPt sends the necessary information to APSt in step 7, 
   which includes the authorization token. The APSt requests local 
   authorization in a similar fashion as that described for the 
   originating domain. The APSt then uses the authorization token and 
   other message data to authenticate the token and determine if inter-
   domain authorization has been granted. In step 8 the APSt passes a 
   status to the SPt indicating if the session has been authorized. If 
   the call and all requested services are granted, the SPt forwards 
   the INVITE on to the UAt in step 9. 
    
   The UAt may then send the RSVP Path message to UAo in step 10 since 
   it knows the source and destination addresses and ports and the 
   traffic specifications. Note that in some cases, the SDP sent from 
 
Gross et al.             Expires October 2001                [Page 15] 
Internet Draft    QoS AAA SIP Based IP Communication        April 2001 
 
 
   UAt to UAo may contain multiple media formats, each having different 
   bandwidth requirements. In this case, the UAo must make a final 
   decision considering the choice(s) of media formats. If the traffic 
   specifications change, additional RSVP messages may be sent to 
   update the network devices along the session data path. 
    
   In step 11 the UAt sends back a 180 (ringing) SIP response to UAo 
   via SPo and SPt. In some cases, the UAt may send a 183 (session 
   progress) SIP response followed by a 180 response. The 183 response 
   would follow the same path as the 180 response. For simplicity, only 
   the 180 response is shown in the figures.

   UAo may now send a RSVP Path message to UAt in step 12 since it 
   knows the source and destination addresses and ports and the traffic 
   specifications. When RSVP Path messages arrive at UAo and UAt, they 
   may send a RSVP Resv message as shown in steps 13 and 14. 
    
   In step 15, UAt sends a final 200 (OK) response to SPo via SPt. If 
   the source, destination or media information are different from what 
   was specified previously, SPo sends a message to APSo in step 16. 
   APSo checks local policy and returns a status to SPo in step 17 
   indicating if the session is still allowed. If so, SPo sends the 200 
   response to UAo in step 18. 
    
   The UAo confirms reception of the 200 response and establishment of 
   the session by sending a SIP ACK message to SPo in step 19. The 
   session data is now exchanged via RTP, or some similar protocol, in 
   step 20. The session ends for UAo when, for example, a SIP BYE 
   message is sent to SPo in step 21. SPo sends a COPS report and 
   deletes the COPS request state in APSo in step 22. The BYE message 
   is simultaneously forwarded to SPt in step 23. SPt sends a COPS 
   report and deletes the COPS request state in APSt in step 24. The 
   BYE message is sent to UAt in step 25. 
    
   PathTear and ResvTear messages are sent from UAo and UAt upon call 
   completion (from UAt when it receives the BYE message) in steps 26 
   and 27. This triggers a COPS DRQ from ERo and ERt to APSo and APSt, 
   respectively. These messages are not shown but implicitly implied. 
   APSo and APSt may then perform necessary accounting/bookkeeping 
   chores. Alternately, ResvErr messages may be sent by an APS under 
   cancellation circumstances by APSo or APSt. 
    
   The APSo and APSt send usage reports to the CH in steps 28 and 29 to 
   indicate session duration, QoS services consumed such as bandwidth, 
   and possibly other session details necessary for inter-domain 
   accounting and settlement. 
    
   Other circumstances may cause the reservation in one or both 
   directions to fail. In this case, ResvErr messages may be injected 
   into the session data path. Upon reception of a PathErr or ResvErr 
   message, an ERo/t would remove the corresponding state and notify 
   APSo/t. 
    
7.2. Terminating Domain Contacts Clearinghouse 
    
   The caller may have a reason to allow the terminating domain to 
   contact the CH for inter-domain authorization. For example, the 
   caller may require that the callee make an unusually large bandwidth 
   reservation for a critical IP communication exchange. The caller 
   does not know the limits of services the callee is entitled to. In 
   this case the caller may forego inter-domain authorization during 
   call setup. Instead, the APSt, on behalf of the callee, receives the 
   INVITE without a token, negotiates for an allowable level of 
   service, then contacts the CH for an authorization request. The 
   resulting authorization token is then placed inside the 200 response

   sent back to the caller. Such a scenario may only make sense if the 
   CH requires bandwidth information (or other QOS service information 
   such as latency or jitter) to make an authorization decision. 
    
   The benefits of this are debatable. One advantage is that if 
   successful negotiation is not possible, the call may be cancelled 
   without contacting the CH, saving a message exchange. The message 
   exchange scenario is similar to that of Figure 5 with minor changes. 
    
8. Accounting, Charging and Billing 
    
   We make a clear distinction between accounting, charging and billing 
   and provide a summary, possibly incomplete description. 
    
   Accounting: The process of logging the usage of network resources, 
   such as QoS or PSTN gateway services. The accounting data may or may 
   not be used for usage charging, depending on the service model. This 
   draft addresses accounting only and does not address charging and 
   billing. 
    
   Charging: Allocating the cost to various parties according to some 
   business policies. Cost allocation may depend on such parameters as 
   class of service, geographic locations, time of day, promotions, 
   incentives for resellers and others. Examples of different business 
   policies and classes of service are usage based charging and flat 
   rate subscription rates. 
    
   Billing: Informing various users of the charges and expected 
   payments. 
    
9. Security Considerations 
    
   This document addresses some security issues concerning 
   authentication of inter-domain business relationships. The protocols 
   discussed in this work, SIP, COPS and OSP contain their own security 
   mechanisms. Any security issues not addressed by SIP, COPS or OSP 
   have not been considered in this work and are left as open issues.
