1.  Introduction

   It can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a BGP-4 [RFC4271]
   session teardown in the network with a notice that was transmitted
   via off-line methods such email or telephone calls.  This document
   specifies a mechanism to transmit a short freeform UTF-8 [RFC3629]
   message as part of a Cease NOTIFICATION message [RFC4486] to inform
   the peer why the BGP session is being shutdown.

2.  Shutdown Communication

   If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its session with a BGP
   neighbor, then the BGP speaker MAY send to the neighbor a
   NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code "Cease" and the Error
   Subcode "Administrative Shutdown" followed by a freeform UTF-8
   encoded string with a REQUIRED maximum length of 128 octets.  The
   contents of the string are at the operator's discretion.

   The Shutdown Communication Cease NOTIFICATION message is encoded as
   below:

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Length value can range from 0 to 128 and indicates how many
   octets of Shutdown Communication follow.

   To support international characters, the Shutdown Communication field
   MUST be encoded using UTF-8.

   The sending BGP speaker SHOULD avoid octet values below 32 (control
   characters), however these values are legal.  Following UNICODE TR36
   [UTR36], Sec 3.1, the sending BGP speaker MUST encode messages in the
   "shortest form" and MUST NOT interpret messages in the "non-shortest
   form".  A receiving BGP speaker MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8
   sequences.

   Mechanisms concerning the reporting of information contained in the
   Shutdown Communication are implementation specific but SHOULD include
   methods such as SYSLOG [RFC5424].

3.  Operational Considerations

   Operators are encouraged to use the Shutdown Communication to inform
   their peers of the reason for the shutdown of the BGP session and
   include out-of-band reference materials.  An example of a useful
   Shutdown Communication would be:

   "[TICKET-1-1438367390] software upgrade, back in 2 hours"

   "[TICKET-1-1438367390]" is a ticket reference with significance to
   both the sender and receiver, followed by a brief human readable
   message regarding the reason for the BGP session shutdown followed by
   an indication about the length of the maintenance.  The receiver can
   now use the string 'TICKET-1-1438367390' to search in their email
   archive to find more details.

4.  Error Handling

   Any erroneous or malformed Shutdown Communication received SHOULD be
   logged for the attention of the operator and then MAY be discarded.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA is requested to reference this document at
   subcode "Administrative Shutdown" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message
   subcodes" registry under the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   Parameters" group.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown Communication.
   There are a number of security issues with UNICODE.  Implementers and
   operator are advised to review UNICODE TR36 [UTR36] to learn about
   these issues.  This document guards against the technical issues
   outlined in UTR36 by REQUIRING "shortest form" encoding.  However,
   the visual spoofing due to character confusion still persists.  This
   document tries to minimize the effects of visual spoofing by allowing
   UNICODE only where local script is expected and needed, and by
   limiting the length of the Shutdown Communication.

7.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
   Shutdown Communication:
