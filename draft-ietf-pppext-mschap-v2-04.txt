Abstract

     The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) [1] provides a standard method
     for transporting multi-protocol datagrams over point-to-point
     links.  PPP defines an extensible Link Control Protocol and a
     family of Network Control Protocols (NCPs) for establishing and
     configuring different network-layer protocols.

     This document describes version two of Microsoft's PPP CHAP dialect

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

     (MS-CHAP-V2).  MS-CHAP-V2 is similar to, but incompatible with, MS-
     CHAP version one (MS-CHAP-V1, described in [9]).  In particular,
     certain protocol fields have been deleted or reused but with
     different semantics.  In addition, MS-CHAP-V2 features mutual
     authentication.

     The algorithms used in the generation of various MS-CHAP-V2
     protocol fields are described in section 8.  Negotiation and hash
     generation examples are provided in section 9.

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

1.  Introduction

Where possible, MS-CHAP-V2 is consistent with both MS-CHAP-V1 and
standard CHAP.  Briefly, the differences between MS-CHAP-V2 and MS-CHAP-
V1 are:

   * MS-CHAP-V2 is enabled by negotiating CHAP Algorithm 0x81 in LCP
     option 3, Authentication Protocol.

   * MS-CHAP-V2 provides mutual authentication between peers by
     piggybacking a peer challenge on the Response packet and an
     authenticator reponse on the Success packet.

   * The calculation of the "Windows NT compatible challenge
     response" sub-field in the Response packet has been changed
     to include the peer challenge and the user name.

   * In MS-CHAP-V1, the "LAN Manager compatible challenge response"
     sub-field was always sent in the Response packet.  This field
     has been replaced in MS-CHAP-V2 by the Peer-Challenge field.

   * The format of the Message field in the Failure packet has
     been changed.

   * The Change Password (version 1) and Change Password (version 2)
     packets are no longer supported. They have been replaced with a
     single Change-Password packet.

2.  LCP Configuration

The LCP configuration for MS-CHAP-V2 is identical to that for standard
CHAP, except that the Algorithm field has value 0x81, rather than the
MD5 value 0x05.  PPP implementations which do not support MS-CHAP-V2,
but correctly implement LCP Config-Rej, should have no problem dealing
with this non-standard option.

3.  Challenge Packet

The MS-CHAP-V2 Challenge packet is identical in format to the standard
CHAP Challenge packet.

MS-CHAP-V2 authenticators send an 16-octet challenge Value field.  Peers
need not duplicate Microsoft's algorithm for selecting the 16-octet
value, but the standard guidelines on randomness [1,2,7] SHOULD be
observed.

Zorn                                                            [Page 5]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

Microsoft authenticators do not currently provide information in the
Name field.  This may change in the future.

4.  Response Packet

The MS-CHAP-V2 Response packet is identical in format to the standard
CHAP Response packet.  However, the Value field is sub-formatted
differently as follows:

   16 octets: Peer-Challenge
    8 octets: Reserved, must be zero
   24 octets: NT-Response
    1 octet : Flags

The Peer-Challenge field is a 16-octet random number.  As the name
implies, it is generated by the peer and is used in the calculation of
the NT-Response field, below.  Peers need not duplicate Microsoft's
algorithm for selecting the 16-octet value, but the standard guidelines
on randomness [1,2,7] SHOULD be observed.

The NT-Response field is an encoded function of the password, the user
name, the contents of the Peer-Challenge field and the received
challenge as output by the routine GenerateNTResponse() (see section
8.1, below).  The Windows NT password is a string of 0 to
(theoretically) 256 case-sensitive Unicode [8] characters.  Current
versions of Windows NT limit passwords to 14 characters, mainly for
compatibility reasons; this may change in the future.  When computing
the NT-Response field contents, only the user name is used, without any
associated Windows NT domain name.  This is true regardless of whether a
Windows NT domain name is present in the Name field (see below).

The Flag field is reserved for future use and MUST be zero.

The Name field is a string of 0 to (theoretically) 256 case-sensitive
ASCII characters which identifies the peer's user account name.  The
Windows NT domain name may prefix the user's account name (e.g.
"BIGCO\johndoe" where "BIGCO" is a Windows NT domain containing the user
account "johndoe").  If a domain is not provided, the backslash should
also be omitted, (e.g. "johndoe").

5.  Success Packet

The Success packet is identical in format to the standard CHAP Success
packet.  However, the Message field contains a 42-octet authenticator
response string and a printable message.  The format of the message
field is illustrated below.

Zorn                                                            [Page 6]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

   "S=<auth_string> M=<message>"

The <auth_string> quantity is a 20 octet number encoded in ASCII as 40
hexadecimal digits.  The hexadecimal digits A-F (if present) MUST be
uppercase.  This number is derived from the challenge from the Challenge
packet, the Peer-Challenge and NT-Response fields from the Response
packet, and the peer password as output by the routine
GenerateAuthenticatorResponse() (see section 8.7, below).  The
authenticating peer MUST verify the authenticator response when a
Success packet is received.  The method for verifying the authenticator
is described in section 8.8, below.  If the authenticator response is
either missing or incorrect, the peer MUST end the session.

The <message> quantity is human-readable text in the appropriate charset
and language [12].

6.  Failure Packet

The Failure packet is identical in format to the standard CHAP Failure
packet.  There is, however, formatted text stored in the Message field
which, contrary to the standard CHAP rules, does affect the operation of
the protocol.  The Message field format is:

      "E=eeeeeeeeee R=r C=cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc V=vvvvvvvvvv
M=<msg>"

   where

      The "eeeeeeeeee" is the ASCII representation of a decimal error
      code (need not be 10 digits) corresponding to one of those listed
      below, though implementations should deal with codes not on this
      list gracefully.

         646 ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS
         647 ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED
         648 ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED
         649 ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION
         691 ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
         709 ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD

      The "r" is an ASCII flag set to '1' if a retry is allowed, and '0'
      if not.  When the authenticator sets this flag to '1' it disables
      short timeouts, expecting the peer to prompt the user for new
      credentials and resubmit the response.

      The "cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc" is the ASCII representation
      of a hexadecimal challenge value.  This field MUST be exactly 32
      octets long and MUST be present.

Zorn                                                            [Page 7]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

      The "vvvvvvvvvv" is the ASCII representation of a decimal version
      code (need not be 10 digits) indicating the password changing
      protocol version supported on the server.  For MS-CHAP-V2, this
      value SHOULD always be 3.

      <msg> is human-readable text in the appropriate charset and
      language [12].

7.  Change-Password Packet

The Change-Password packet does not appear in either standard CHAP or
MS-CHAP-V1.  It allows the peer to change the password on the account
specified in the preceding Response packet.  The Change-Password packet
should be sent only if the authenticator reports ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED
(E=648) in the Message field of the Failure packet.

This packet type is supported by recent versions of Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 95 and Windows 98.  It is not supported by Windows NT 3.5,
Windows NT 3.51, or early versions of Windows NT 4.0, Windows 95 and
Windows 98.

   The format of this packet is as follows:

        1 octet  : Code
        1 octet  : Identifier
        2 octets : Length
      516 octets : Encrypted-Password
       16 octets : Encrypted-Hash
       16 octets : Peer-Challenge
        8 octets : Reserved
       24 octets : NT-Response
        2-octet  : Flags

   Code
      7

   Identifier
      The Identifier field is one octet and aids in matching requests
      and replies.  The value is the Identifier of the received Failure
      packet to which this packet responds plus 1.

   Length
      586

   Encrypted-Password
      This field contains the PWBLOCK form of the new Windows NT
      password encrypted with the old Windows NT password hash, as

Zorn                                                            [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

      output by the NewPasswordEncryptedWithOldNtPasswordHash() routine
      (see section 8.9, below).

   Encrypted-Hash
      This field contains the old Windows NT password hash encrypted
      with the new Windows NT password hash, as output by the
      OldNtPasswordHashEncryptedWithNewNtPasswordHash() routine (see
      section 8.12, below).

   Peer-Challenge
      A 16-octet random quantity, as described in the Response packet
      description.

   Reserved
      8 octets, must be zero.

   NT-Response
      The NT-Response field (as described in the Response packet
      description), but calculated on the new password and the challenge
      received in the Failure packet.

   Flags
      This field is two octets in length.  It is a bit field of option
      flags where 0 is the least significant bit of the 16-bit quantity.
      The format of this field is illustrated in the following diagram:

                    1
          5 4 3 2 1 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
         |                               |
         +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

         Bits 0-15
            Reserved, always clear (0).

9.  Examples

The following sections include protocol negotiation and hash generation
examples.

9.1.  Negotiation Examples

Here are some examples of typical negotiations.  The peer is on the left
and the authenticator is on the right.

The packet sequence ID is incremented on each authentication retry
response and on the change password response.  All cases where the
packet sequence ID is updated are noted below.

Response retry is never allowed after Change Password.  Change Password
may occur after response retry.

9.1.1.  Successful authentication

                      <- Authenticator Challenge
    Peer Response/Challenge ->
                      <- Success/Authenticator Response

(Authenticator Response verification succeeds, call continues)

9.1.2.  Authenticator authentication failure

                      <- Authenticator Challenge
    Peer Response/Challenge ->

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

                      <- Success/Authenticator Response

(Authenticator Response verification fails, peer disconnects)

9.1.3.  Failed authentication with no retry allowed

                      <- Authenticator Challenge
    Peer Response/Challenge ->
                      <- Failure (E=691 R=0)

(Authenticator disconnects)

9.1.4.  Successful authentication after retry

                      <- Authenticator Challenge
    Peer Response/Challenge ->
                      <- Failure (E=691 R=1), disable short timeout
    Response (++ID) to challenge in failure message ->
                      <- Success/Authenticator Response

(Authenticator Response verification succeeds, call continues)

9.1.5.  Failed hack attack with 3 attempts allowed

                      <- Authenticator Challenge
    Peer Response/Challenge ->
                      <- Failure (E=691 R=1), disable short timeout
    Response (++ID) to challenge in Failure message ->
                      <- Failure (E=691 R=1), disable short timeout
    Response (++ID) to challenge in Failure message ->
                      <- Failure (E=691 R=0)

9.1.6.  Successful authentication with password change

                      <- Authenticator Challenge
    Peer Response/Challenge ->
                      <- Failure (E=648 R=0 V=3), disable short timeout
    ChangePassword (++ID) to challenge in Failure message ->
                      <- Success/Authenticator Response

(Authenticator Response verification succeeds, call continues)

9.1.7.  Successful authentication with retry and password change

                      <- Authenticator Challenge
    Peer Response/Challenge ->
                      <- Failure (E=691 R=1), disable short timeout

(Authenticator Response verification succeeds, call continues)

Intermediate values for user name "User" and password "clientPass".  All
numeric values are hexadecimal.

   0-to-256-char UserName:

   0-to-256-unicode-char Password:
   63 00 6C 00 69 00 65 00 6E 00 74 00 50 00 61 00 73 00 73 00

   16-octet PeerChallenge:
   21 40 23 24 25 5E 26 2A 28 29 5F 2B 3A 33 7C 7E

   8-octet Challenge:

   16-octet PasswordHash:
   44 EB BA 8D 53 12 B8 D6 11 47 44 11 F5 69 89 AE

   16-octet PasswordHashHash:
   41 C0 0C 58 4B D2 D9 1C 40 17 A2 A1 2F A5 9F 3F

   42-octet AuthenticatorResponse:
   "S=407A5589115FD0D6209F510FE9C04566932CDA56"

Zorn                                                           [Page 18]

INTERNET-DRAFT                 MS-CHAP-V2                   October 1999

9.3.  Example of DES Key Generation

DES uses 56-bit keys, expanded to 64 bits by the insertion of parity
bits.  After the parity of the key has been fixed, every eighth bit is a
parity bit and the number of bits that are set (1) in each octet is odd;
i.e., odd parity.  Note that many DES engines do not check parity,
however, simply stripping the parity bits.  The following example
illustrates the values resulting from the use of the password "MyPw" to
generate a pair of DES keys (e.g., for use in the
NtPasswordHashEncryptedWithBlock() described in section 8.13).

   0-to-256-unicode-char Password:
   4D 79 50 77

   16-octet PasswordHash:
   FC 15 6A F7 ED CD 6C 0E DD E3 33 7D 42 7F 4E AC

   First "raw" DES key (initial 7 octets of password hash):
   FC 15 6A F7 ED CD 6C

   First parity-corrected DES key (eight octets):
   FD 0B 5B 5E 7F 6E 34 D9

   Second "raw" DES key (second 7 octets of password hash)
   0E DD E3 33 7D 42 7F

   Second parity-corrected DES key (eight octets):
   0E 6E 79 67 37 EA 08 FE

10.  Security Considerations

As an implementation detail, the authenticator SHOULD limit the number
of password retries allowed to make brute-force password guessing
attacks more difficult.
