Abstract

   The flexible authentication via secure tunneling EAP method (EAP-
   FAST) enables secure communication between a peer and a server by
   using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to establish a mutually
   authenticated tunnel.  Within this tunnel a basic password exchange,
   based on the generic token card method (EAP-GTC), may be executed to
   authenticate the peer.

Internet-Draft              EAP-FAST with GTC                  July 2008


1.  Introduction

   EAP-FAST [RFC4851] is an EAP method that can be used to mutually
   authenticate peer and server.  This document describes the EAP-FAST
   inner EAP method, EAP-GTC, which is used to authenticate the peer
   through a basic password exchange.  EAP-GTC, described in [RFC3748],
   was chosen due to its versatility and simplicity.  Message exchanges,
   including user credentials, are clear text strings transferred within
   the encrypted TLS tunnel and thus are considered secure.  All EAP-GTC
   packets sent within the TLS tunnel must be encapsulated in EAP
   Payload TLVs, described in [RFC4851].  Note that EAP-GTC payloads
   used in EAP-FAST require specific formatting and therefore will not
   necessarily be compatible with EAP-GTC mechanisms used outside of
   EAP-FAST.  GTC in EAP-FAST was developed to support using clear text
   passwords to authenticate to legacy user databases, to facilitate
   password change and to support one time password features such as new
   pin mode.

   It is assumed that reader of this document is familiar with EAP-FAST
   [RFC4851].

1.1.  Specification Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  EAP-FAST GTC Authentication

   All EAP-GTC packets inside EAP-FAST other than the empty
   acknowledgment packet MUST follow the "LABEL=Value" format.
   Currently, three Labels are defined:

   o  "CHALLENGE", the server request packet MUST be in the form of
      "CHALLENGE=Value", where Value is the server challenge, such as
      "please enter your password."

   o  "RESPONSE", the peer response packet MUST be in the form of
      "RESPONSE=Value", where Value is the peer response.

   o  "E", the server failure packet MUST be in the form of "E=Value",
      where Value is the error message generated by the server.

   If the peer or the server receives an EAP-GTC request or response
   that is not in the format specified above, it SHOULD fail the
   authentication by sending a Result TLV with a failure.

   After the TLS encryption tunnel is established and EAP-FAST
   Authentication Phase 2 starts, the EAP Server sends an EAP-GTC
   Request, which contains a server challenge.  This EAP-GTC Request
   will often be accompanied with a displayable message for use as the
   user prompt.

   A peer MAY prompt the user for the user credentials, or decide to use
   the user credentials gained through some other means without
   prompting the user.  The peer sends the user credentials back in the
   EAP-GTC Response using the following format:

   "RESPONSE=user@example.com\0secret"

   where "user@example.com" is the actual user name and "secret" is the
   actual password.  The NULL character "\0" is used to separate the
   user name and password.

   The username and password are included in a single message in the
   first response packet as an optimization by eliminating the inner
   method EAP-Identity exchange to save an extra round trip.

   Once the EAP-FAST server receives the user credentials, it SHOULD
   first validate the user identity with the I-ID in the PAC-Opaque and
   if it matches, it will continue to authenticate the user with
   internal or external user databases.

   Additional exchanges MAY occur between the EAP-FAST server and peer
   to facilitate various user authentications.  The EAP-FAST server

Internet-Draft              EAP-FAST with GTC                  July 2008


   might send additional challenges to the peer for additional
   information, such as password change or new pin mode in the OTP
   [RFC2289] case.  The peer MAY prompt the user again and send back the
   needed information in an EAP-GTC Response.

   An EAP-GTC server implementation within EAP-FAST uses the following
   format to indicate error if an authentication fails:

       "E=eeeeeeeeee R=r M=<msg>"

   where

   The "eeeeeeeeee" is the ASCII representation of a decimal error code
   corresponding to one of those listed below, though peer
   implementations SHOULD deal with codes not on this list gracefully.
   The error code need not be 10 digits long.

   Below is a complete list of predefined error codes:

   o  646 ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS

      Indicates that access is attempted outside the allowed hours

   o  647 ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED

      Indicates the requested account is disabled

   o  648 ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED

      Indicates the password has expired and password change is required

   o  649 ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION

      Indicates that access has been denied due to lack of dial in
      permission

   o  691 ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE

      Indicates authentication failure due to incorrect username or
      password

   o  709 ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD

      Indicates password change failed

   o  755 ERROR_PAC_I-ID-NO_MATCH

      Indicates that the PAC used to establish the EAP-FAST session

      cannot be used to authenticate to this user account

   The "r" is a single character ASCII flag set to '1' if a retry is
   allowed, and '0' if not.  When the server sets this flag to '1' it
   disables short timeouts, expecting the peer to prompt the user for
   new credentials and resubmit the response.  When the server sets this
   flag to '0' the peer SHOULD NOT prompt the user for new credentials
   to try again without restarting the EAP-FAST authentication from the
   beginning.

   The <msg> is human-readable text in the appropriate character set and
   language [RFC2484].

   Peer SHOULD ignore any unknown label in the failure packet.

   The error format described above is similar to what are defined in
   MSCHAPv2 [RFC2759], except for the omission of server challenge.  So
   if the EAP-FAST Server is distributing MSCHAPV2 exchanges to the
   backend inner method server, it can simply just return what the
   backend inner method server returns less the server challenge.  In
   the case of connecting to an OTP or LDAP [RFC4511] server, the EAP-
   FAST Server can format the error message into this format.  With the
   addition of the retry count, peer can potentially prompt the user for
   new credentials to try again without restarting the EAP-FAST
   authentication from the beginning.  Peer will respond to the error
   code with another EAP-GTC Response packet with both the new user name
   and password or in case of other unrecoverable failures, an empty
   EAP-GTC packet for acknowledgement.  Peer uses empty EAP-GTC payload
   as an acknowledgment to the unrecoverable failure.

   If the EAP-FAST server finishes authentication for EAP-GTC inner
   method, it will proceed to Protected Termination as described in
   [RFC4851].  In the case of an unrecoverable EAP-GTC authentication
   failure, the EAP server can send a GTC error code as described above,
   along with the Result TLV for protected termination.  This way, no
   extra round trips will occur.  The peer can acknowledge the GTC
   failure as well as the Result TLV within the same EAP-FAST packet.
   Once server receives the acknowledgement, the TLS tunnel will be torn
   down and a clear text EAP-Failure will be sent.

   The user name and password, as well as server challenges MAY support
   non-ASCII characters.  In this case, international user name,
   password, and messages are based on the use of Unicode characters,
   encoded as UTF-8 [RFC3629] and processed with a certain algorithm to
   ensure a canonical representation.  The input should be processed
   according to [RFC4282] Section 2.4.

   Since EAP-GTC does not generate session keys, the ISK used for

3.  Security Considerations

   The EAP-GTC method sends password information in the clear and MUST
   NOT be used outside of a protected tunnel providing strong protection
   such as the one provided by EAP-FAST.  Weak encryption such as, 40-
   bit encryption or NULL cipher, MUST NOT be used.  In addition, the
   peer MUST authenticate the server before disclosing its credentials.
   Since EAP-FAST Server-Unauthenticated Provisioning Mode does not
   authenticate the server, EAP-GTC MUST NOT be used as the inner method
   in this mode.  EAP-GTC MAY be used in EAP-FAST authentication and
   Server-Authenticated Provisioning Mode, where the server is
   authenticated.  Since GTC requires the server to have access to the
   actual authentication secret, it is RECOMMENDED to vary the stored
   authentication validation data by domain so that a compromise of a
   server at one location does not compromise others.

4.  IANA Considerations

   EAP-GTC has already been assigned the value of 6 for the EAP Type in
   [RFC3748].

   The document defines a registry for EAP-GTC error codes when running
   inside EAP-FAST, which may be assigned by Specification Required as
   defined in [RFC5226].  A summary of the error codes defined so far is
   given below:

   o  646 ERROR_RESTRICTED_LOGON_HOURS

   o  647 ERROR_ACCT_DISABLED

   o  648 ERROR_PASSWD_EXPIRED

   o  649 ERROR_NO_DIALIN_PERMISSION

   o  691 ERROR_AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE

   o  709 ERROR_CHANGING_PASSWORD

   o  755 ERROR_PAC_I-ID-NO_MATCH
