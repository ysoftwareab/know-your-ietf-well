1.   Introduction
   
   As the Internet grows, modern devices and networking environments
   create new performance challenges for the File Transfer Protocol
   (FTP) [1].  One solution to this problem, which is addressed in the
   FTP "compress" transmission mode, is to compress file and system
   data to maximize network resources.  However, the original system is
   designed to reduce ASCII text with repetitive characters and is
   unsuitable in many applications because it can add significant
   network overhead to binary transfers.  This document enhances the
   capabilities of FTP by introducing a new "deflate" transmission mode
   that: 
   
      * increases network throughput and decreases transfer time 
   
      * effectively compresses ASCII and binary data
   
      * requires a minimum amount of control information
   
      * provides error recovery and data integrity options
   
      * includes a mechanism to negotiate compression parameters to
        balance CPU, memory and data requirements
   
      * is extensible to accommodate future compression techniques

2.   Document Conventions

   This document makes use of the conventions defined in BCP 14 [2]
   which includes the explanation of capitalized imperative words MUST,
   SHOULD, MAY, SHOULD NOT and MUST NOT.  Any syntax is defined using
   Augmented BNF (ABNF) as specified in RFC 2234 [3].
   
   The terms "reply", "user",  "file", "pathname",   "FTP commands",
   "DTP", "user-FTP process", "user-PI", "user-DTP",  "server-FTP

   process", "server-PI", "server-DTP", "mode", "type",  "NVT",
   "control connection", "data connection", "transmission mode",
   "binary" and "ASCII" are all used here as defined in STD 9 [1].
   
   In addition, this specification makes use of the terms "compression
   engine" and "compression method."  A compression engine is a
   hardware or software component that implements a compression method.  

   The compression method is a process that reduces the size of
   computer data.

2.1    Basic Tokens
   
   This document imports the core definitions given in Appendix A of
   RFC 2234 [3] which includes the ABNF elements like ALPHA, DIGIT, SP,
   etc.  The following terms are added for use in this document:
   
           TCHAR  = VCHAR / SP / HTAB    ; visible plus white space
           RCHAR  = ALPHA / DIGIT / "," / "." / ":" / "!" /
                    "@" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "^" /
                    "&" / "(" / ")" / "-" / "_" /
                    "+" / "?" / "/" / "\" / "'" /
                    DQUOTE   ; <"> -- double quote character (%x22)
           SCHAR  = RCHAR / "=" ;
   
   The VCHAR (from [3]), RCHAR, SCHAR, and TCHAR types give basic
   character types from varying sub-sets of the ASCII character set for
   use in various commands and responses.
   
           token  = 1*RCHAR
   
   A "token" is a string whose precise meaning depends upon the context
   in which it is used.  In some cases it will be a value from a set of
   possible values and in others it might be a string invented by one
   party for an FTP conversation.
   
   Note that in ABNF, string literals are case insensitive.  That
   convention is preserved in this document, and implies that FTP
   commands added by this specification have names that can be
   represented in any case.  For example, "MODE" is the same as "mode"
   and "Mode".  However, ALPHA characters are case sensitive which
   implies a token can have an exact value.  That implication is
   correct, except where explicitly stated to the contrary in this
   document, or in some other specification which defines the values
   this document specifies be used in a particular context.

3.   Deflate Transmission Mode
   
   The deflate extension introduces a fourth transmission mode to FTP
   by updating the transfer mode (MODE) command.  It employs general
   purpose compression methods to reduce data for efficient transfers.   



Preston & Saunders     [Expires December 30, 2010]           [Page 3]
Internet Draft   draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-04.txt        June 2010 


   
   The following codes are assigned for transfer modes:
   
      S  Stream
      B  Block
      C  Compressed
      Z  Deflate
   
   The default transfer mode remains Stream.

3.1    Client-server Interaction

   The user-FTP process sends the MODE Z command to request compressed
   data transfers.  If the server-FTP process accepts the request, then
   deflate transmission mode will be used for all data transfers until
   the client switches to another mode.
   
3.2    Overview

   In deflate transmission mode, data is compressed and transmitted as
   a stream of octets (8 bit bytes).  The sender and receiver rely on a
   compression engine to perform compression operations
   (deflate/inflate) and maintain state.  There is no restriction on
   the representation type used; record structures are allowed. 
   
   Since there is no fixed compression format, both FTP hosts MUST
   process data until the compression engine reports an end-of-file
   (EOF) state or data error.  Closing the data connection is not a
   sufficient method to end transfers because there may be pending
   information.
   
   If an FTP process encounters an error while compressing or
   decompressing the data stream, it SHOULD discard all information
   after that point and cancel the transfer using the procedures
   described in STD 9 [1].
   
3.3    Compression Engine

   Each compression engine generates a unique data stream that MAY
   consist of the following parts: header and control information,
   compressed data, integrity checkpoints and end-of-file (EOF)
   markers.  The compression engine MUST support an EOF mechanism and
   MUST NOT send non-essential structures like version headers. 
   
   
3.3.1      ZLIB Compression Engine
   
   All FTP processes that support deflate transmission mode MUST
   support the ZLIB compressed data format specified in RFC 1950 [5]. 


Preston & Saunders     [Expires December 30, 2010]           [Page 4]
Internet Draft   draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-04.txt        June 2010 


   The ZLIB compression method, an LZ77 variant called deflation,
   provides a lossless compressed data format that:
   
      * is independent of CPU type, operating system, file system
        and character set and is therefore ideal for network
        communications
      
      * provides a number of different compression settings 
        (ratios are in the order of 2:1 to 5:1) that accommodates
        a wide range of CPU, memory and data requirements
      
      * minimizes control data overhead (approximately 0.02% for 
        large data streams)
   
      * provides integrity checks
   
      * can be implemented readily in a manner not covered by 
        patents, and hence can be practiced freely
   
   In the worst case, ZLIB reverts to stored (uncompressed) blocks
   making the deflate data stream analogous to STREAM transmission
   mode.
   
   By default, compliant FTP processes MUST support compression method
   8 and transmit the CMF, FLG and ADLER32 information in the data
   stream.  If bandwidth or processing requirements are a concern,
   these restrictions can be negotiated with the OPTS command.

3.4    Syntax
   
   The deflate extension modifies the MODE command by adding the
   parameter "Z":
   
   Request:
   
      mode              = "MODE" SP "Z" CRLF
   
   Response:
   
      mode-response     = mode-good / mode-bad
      mode-good         = "200" SP response-message CRLF
      mode-bad          = "451" SP response-message CRLF /
                        = "501" SP response-message CRLF
      response-message  = *TCHAR
   
   A "mode-good" response (200 reply) MUST be sent when the "Z"
   parameter is recognized and the current compression settings are
   appropriate.  An "mode-bad" response is sent in other cases.  The
   451 reply should be used when the current compression settings or



Preston & Saunders     [Expires December 30, 2010]           [Page 5]
Internet Draft   draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-04.txt       April 2010 


   some other temporary condition at the server prevent the command
   from being accepted; but a changed environment for the server-FTP
   process may permit the command to succeed.  A 501 reply is
   appropriate for a permanent error.
  
3.5    FEAT Response
   
   If the server-FTP process supports the feature (FEAT) command
   specified in RFC 2389 [4], then it MUST include a "MODE Z" feature
   line.  This string indicates required support for the extension and
   lists the names of additional compression engines:
   
      mode-feat   = SP "MODE" SP "Z" [SP eng-list] CRLF
      eng-list    = *(eng-desc ",")
      eng-desc    = 1*(eng-name eng-opts)
      eng-name    = ALPHA*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / ".")
      eng-opts    = *("(" opts-list ")")
      opts-list   = 1*(opt-name ",")
      opt-name    = ALPHA*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
   
   If eng-list is not present, then the server-FTP process is informing
   the client that ZLIB is the only engine available. 
   
   The "MODE Z" feature line string is not case sensitive, but SHOULD
   be transmitted in upper case.
   
   In the case where the server-FTP process does not support the FEAT
   command, the user-FTP can negotiate the deflate extension by sending
   the "MODE Z" request.  The server would respond with a positive
   (200) reply and the default compression settings would be effective.

3.5.1      FEAT Examples
   
   The following examples contrast three servers with deflate support. 
   The first server advertises ZLIB and BZIP2 capabilities, while the
   second indicates the required ZLIB engine and the third implements
   ZLIB and a proprietary compression engine.
   
   C> FEAT
   S> 211-Extensions supported:
   S>  =85
   S>  MODE Z BZIP2(LEVEL,BLOCKSIZE)
   S>  =85
   S> 211 End.
   
   and
   
   C> FEAT
   S> 211-Extensions supported:


Preston & Saunders     [Expires December 30, 2010]           [Page 6]
Internet Draft   draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-04.txt        June 2010 


   S>  =85
   S>  MODE Z
   S>  =85
   S> 211 End.
   
   and
   
   C> FEAT
   S> 211-Extensions supported:
   S> =85
   S>  MODE Z ENG(SETTING1,SETTING2)
   S> =85
   S> 211 End.
   
   The ellipses indicate place holders where other features may be
   included, and are not required.  A one space indentation of the
   feature line is mandatory [4].

3.6    OPTS Features
   
   The user-FTP process may specify alternate compression settings with
   the OPTS command [4].  All subsequent transfers will use these
   settings until another OPTS request is sent.  The format is
   specified by:
   
      opts  = "OPTS" SP "MODE" SP "Z" [ SP 1*(name SP value ",") ]
      name  = ALPHA*(ALPHA / DIGIT)
      value = 1*RCHAR
   
   When the client sends an "OPTS MODE Z" command, the server will
   examine each opt-name and opt-value pair and update the compression
   engine.  An OPTS request with no parameters will cause the server-
   FTP process to revert to the default compression settings outlined
   in this document.  If the server encounters an invalid or
   unsupported opt-name or opt-value the OPTS request will be rejected.
   
   Note the server-FTP process MUST reject any MODE Z requests during
   data transfers.
   
   If the server-FTP process accepts an OPTS request, it MUST respond
   with a positive (200) reply.  Otherwise, a negative (501) response
   should be sent. 
   
   The deflate extension does not require the server to support all of
   the opt-name and opt-value parameters defined in this documented. 
   If the server-FTP process encounters an invalid or unsupported
   option, it SHOULD return the opt-name in the error reply.  In the
   worst case, where all OPTS requests are rejected, the FTP processes
   revert to the default compression settings.



Preston & Saunders     [Expires December 30, 2010]           [Page 7]
Internet Draft   draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-04.txt        June 2010 


   
   If new opt-name parameters are required, the server-FTP process MUST
   include the labels in the feature string enclosed in brackets and
   separated by commas.  For example, "MODE Z ENG(SETTING1,SETTING2)." 
   The apparatus defined in this specification should be able to handle
   any routine compression setting.

3.6.1      Standard Opt-names
   
   This document defines a standard set of opt-names as follows:
   ENGINE, METHOD, LEVEL, EXTRA and BLOCKSIZE.  Each opt-name is case
   insensitive, or in other words, "ENGINE" is the same as "Engine" and
   "engine".

3.6.1.1        ENGINE Syntax
   
   The syntax of the ENGINE option follows:
   
      eng-option  = eng-label SP eng-value
      eng-label   = "ENGINE"
      eng-value   = ALPHA*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / ".")

3.6.1.2        METHOD Syntax
  
   The METHOD option allows the FTP processes to negotiate the
   compression method.  The syntax of the METHOD option follows:
   
      mth-option  = mth-label SP mth-value
      mth-label   = "METHOD"
      mth-value   = 1*DIGIT

3.6.1.3        LEVEL Syntax
  
   The LEVEL option allows the FTP processes to negotiate the
   compression level.  It will influence the processing requirements
   and length of the compressed stream.  The syntax of the LEVEL option
   follows:
   
      lvl-option  = lvl-label SP lvl-value
      lvl-label   = "LEVEL"
      lvl-value   = 1*DIGIT

3.6.1.4        EXTRA Syntax
  
   The EXTRA option allows the FTP processes to negotiate the
   transmission of non-essential compression information (like version
   headers and trailers). This option does not apply to all compression




Preston & Saunders     [Expires December 30, 2010]           [Page 8]
Internet Draft   draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-04.txt        June 2010 


   engines.  The syntax of the EXTRA option follows:
   
      ext-option  = ext-label SP ext-value
      ext-label   = "EXTRA"
      ext-value   = ext-enable / ext-disable
      ext-enable  = "ON"
      ext-disable = "OFF"

3.6.1.5        BLOCKSIZE Syntax
  
   The BLOCKSIZE option is for compression engines that use block
   sorting algorithms.  It influences the compression ratio and
   processing requirements.  The syntax of the BLOCKSIZE option
   follows:
   
      blk-option  = blk-label SP blk-value
      blk-label   = "BLOCKSIZE"
      blk-value   = 1*DIGIT
   
   The blk-value is specified in octets.

3.6.2      OPTS Examples
   
   The following examples illustrate how a client would change the ZLIB
   compression options and configure a new compression engine. 
   
   C> OPTS MODE Z LEVEL 9
   S> 200 MODE Z LEVEL set to 9.
   C> OPTS MODE Z BLOCKSIZE 8192
   S> 501 MODE Z BLOCKSIZE is not available. 
   C> OPTS MODE Z METHOD 9
   S> 501 MODE Z METHOD 9 is invalid.
   C> OPTS MODE Z ENGINE ZLIB LEVEL 9 EXTRA OFF
   S> 200- MODE Z ENGINE set to ZLIB.
   S> 200- MODE Z LEVEL set to 9.
   S> 200  MODE Z EXTRA set to OFF.
   C> OPTS MODE Z ENGINE ZLIB LEVEL 9 METHOD 15
   S> 501 MODE Z METHOD 15 is invalid.
   
   and
   
   C> OPTS MODE Z ENGINE BZIP2 BLOCKSIZE 8192
   S> 200- MODE Z ENGINE set to BZIP2.
   S> 200  MODE Z BLOCKSIZE set to 8192.
   C> OPTS MODE Z ENGINE ZLIB BLOCKSIZE 8192
   S> 501 MODE Z BLOCKSIZE is not available.

3.7    Error Recovery and Restart
   


Preston & Saunders     [Expires December 30, 2010]           [Page 9]
Internet Draft   draft-preston-ftpext-deflate-04.txt        June 2010 


   In deflate transmission mode, it is not possible to insert restart
   markers into the data stream because they would be indistinguishable
   from compressed data, and the user-FTP can alter the data
   representation by changing compression settings between transfers. 
   However, it is possible to define a restart mechanism by specifying
   a byte offset into the uncompressed data stream.
   
   The logic for this system is similar to the restart mechanisms
   specified in RFC 1123 [7] and other Internet Drafts [8] for STREAM
   transmission mode with the following addendum.  In a compressed data
   stream, the output will always be exactly the same as the input,
   thus an offset will always represent the same position within a
   file.
   
   If the user-FTP process plans to restart a retrieve (RETR) request,
   it will directly calculate the restart marker, and send the
   uncompressed offset in the restart (REST) command.  The server will
   skip to the specified file position. When the transfer continues,
   both FTP processes will operate with a new compressed data stream.
   
   The store (STOR) process works in the same manner as the retrieve
   system.  However, the sender must determine how much data was
   previously received and expanded, with the SIZE [8] command or an
   alternate method, before resuming the transfer.

4.   Security Considerations
   
   The deflate extension does not introduce any protocol related
   security issues.  However, some compression settings may impose a
   considerable load on the FTP server, which could lead to denial of
   service attacks, and compression engines not described in this
   document may contain security vulnerabilities.  If these operational
   risks are a concern, then implementers should consider limiting
   server resources or denying problematic settings.
   
   In some cases, deflate transmission mode can reduce the demands on
   the server.  For example, in a secure FTP session, the combined
   process of compressing and encrypting data is less expensive than
   sending raw encrypted data; and fewer secure renegotiations are
   required because of the shorter transfer times.
   
   A general discussion of issues related to the security of FTP can be
   found in RFC 2577 [9].
