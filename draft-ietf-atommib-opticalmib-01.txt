Editor's Note:

Version 00 of optical mib ID draft draft-ietf-atommib-opticalmib-00.txt 
made the following changes proposed at the 50th IETF meeting:
      (1) Add section 3.6:  Usage of TCM levels
      (2) Modify ODUkTConfigTable
      (3) Add ODUkTcmSinkTable
      (4) Add ODUkTcmSourceTable

This version of the optical mib, Version 01, proposes the following 
additional changes related to optical performance monitorin (PM),
to align with ITU-T Draft New Recommendations G.cemr and G.798, and
editorial changes to improve the readability of the MIB.

Editorial changes for improving the readability of the MIB: 
      - Changed name of MIB from OTN-MIB to OPT-IF-MIB
      - Changed name of MIB module from otnMIB to optIfMibModule
      - Changed all 'otn' prefixes to 'optIf'
      - Added IntervalNumber textual convention and used it as
        the syntax for all IntervalNumber objects
      - Moved PM interval objects from OTSn configuration table
        to new PerfMon group
      - Changed NbrOfValidIntervals object to NumIntervals (i.e.,
        total number instead of valid number of intervals)
      - Changed object ending in NbrOfInvalidIntervals to end
        with NumInvalidIntervals
      - Changed names in interval and previous day tables to
        include 'Last' to denote that the value is the last value
        of that interval/day.
      - Changed the names of all objects ending in TimActDisabled
        to end with TIMActEnabled; this also improved the
        semantics such that a true value means enabled
      - Changed the names of all objects ending in InputPwr
        to end with InputPower
      - Changed the names of all objects ending in LoopThreshold
        to end with LowerInputPowerThreshold or
        LowerOutputPowerThreshold, as appropriate
      - Changed the names of all objects ending in IntervalNbr
        to end with IntervalNumber
      - Changed the names of all objects ending in SafetyThreshold
        to end with UpperOutputPowerThreshold
      - Changed MAX-ACCESS of all Threshold objects to read-write
      - Added compliance specifications and groups
      - Updated descriptions
      - Made formatting changes

Related to optical PM and align with G.cemr:
      - Removed all PMCounterReset objects
      - Removed OTS sink LaserTemp objects

      - Replace ExTI by ExSAPI and ExDAPI
      - Change TimDetDis to TimDetMo (values: Off, SAPI, DAPI, & 
        SAPI+DAPI)
      - Change TTI Received to TTI Accepted
      - Add AcTIStatus - Accepted TTI Status (values: stable, unstable)
      - Add SinkAdaptActive, SourceAdaptActive, and SinkFECEnabled 
        to OCh
      - Update the currectStatus tables. 
        For OTSn, add BDI, remove SSFP, SSFO, SSF, & LOOP.
        For OMSn, add BDI.
        For OCh, add SSF.
        For ODUkP, remove AIS.
      - Add configuration parameters DEGThr and DEGM to OTUk, ODUkP,

1.  Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with SNMP in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it defines
   objects for managing Optical Interfaces associated with Wavelength
   Division Multiplexing systems or characterized by the Optical 
   Transport Network (OTN) in accordance with [ITU G.872].

   Textual Conventions used in this MIB are defined in [RFC2579]
   and [RFC2493]."

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   0    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

   0    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

   0    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

   0    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine 
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual 
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, 
   this loss of machine readable information is not considered to 
   change the semantics of the MIB.

3.  Overview

   In this document, the term OTN (Optical Transport Network) system
   is used to describe devices that are compliant with the requirements 
   specified in the ITU-T Recommendations G.872, G.709, G.798, G.874 and
   G.874.1 [ITU G.872][ITU G.709][ITU G.798][ITU G.874][ITU G.874.1], 
   available as of the date this Internet-Draft. As some of the ITU-T 
   Recommendations have not yet been approved, implementers of DWDM 
   systems are advised to refer to most recent versions of these ITU-T 
   Recommendations.
   
   The optical objects will be managed using the MIB II ifTable and
   ifStackTable.  Additional tables will also be supported to monitor
   layer specific status and provide performance monitoring data.
   In the tables, some entries are required for OTN systems only.
   A Configuration (Config) table, Current Performance Monitoring (PM) 
   table, and Interval PM table will be maintained for the OTSn, OMSn, 
   and OCh layers on a source and sink trail termination basis.  
   These tables will be linked to the ifTable by using the ifIndex 
   that is associated with that layer.
 
   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is an Optical Transport interface.  At present,
   this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the 
   Internet-standard MIB:

   opticalChannel (195), opticalTransport (196) 

   The definitions contained herein are based on the OTN
   specifications in ITU-T G.872[ITU G.798], G.709 [ITU G.709], 
   G.798[ITU G.798], G.874[ITU G.874], and G.874.1 [ITU G.874.1].

3.1.  Use of the ifTable

   This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in
   [RFC2863], is used for optical interfaces.  Only the 
   ifGeneralInformationGroup will be supported for the ifTable and the
   ifStackTable to maintain the relationship between the various layers.
   The OTN layers are managed in the ifTable using IfEntries that 
   correlate to the layers depicted in Figure 1.

   For example, a DWDM device with an Optical Network Node Interface
   (ONNI) will have an Optical Transmission Section (OTS) physical 
   layer, an Optical Multiplex Section (OMS) layer (transports multiple
   optical channels), and an Optical Channel (OCh) layer.  There is a 
   one to one relationship between the OMS and OTS layers.  The OMS 
   layer has fixed connectivity via the OTS and thus no connectivity 
   flexibility at the OMS layer is supported.

   A device with an ONNI that does not multiplex would consist of
   the OTS and OCh layers supporting a single channel.

   MIB II [RFC1213], as extended by [RFC2863], accommodates these cases 
   through appropriate use of the MIB II system and interfaces groups.  
   The system group names and describes the type of managed resource.
   The interfaces group defines which OTN layers apply and how these
   layers are configured and multiplexed.  This is achieved by proper
   representation of OTN Layers as IfEntries as defined in [RFC2863],
   as follows:

   In the following figures, opticalChannel and opticalTransport are 
   abbreviated as och and otn respectively.

                         Figure 1: OTN Layers


   Since the OMSn and OTSn layers have a one to one relationship, only
   one otn IfEntry is required to support these two layers.  Therefore,
   each opticalChannel IfEntry may be mapped to m opticalTransport 
   IfEntries, where m is greater than or equal to 1.  Conversely, each 
   opticalTransport entry may be mapped to n opticalChannel IfEntries, 
   where n is greater than or equal to 1.

   Example 1: Management of unterminated opticalChannel (och) using 
   passive optics

   An OTN device connected with two adjacent nodes in a single
   fiber ring that supports 10 wavelengths per fiber would have
   2 opticalTransport IfEntries and 10 opticalChannel IfEntries, as 
   depicted in Figure 2. Thus, the same 10 opticalChannel IfEntries 
   are stacked above each of the opticalTransport IfEntries.

   Example 2: Management of terminated opticalChannel (och) interfaces

   An OTN device connected with two adjacent nodes in a single
   fiber ring that supports 10 wavelengths per fiber would have
   2 opticalTransport IfEntries and 20 opticalChannel IfEntries, 
   as depicted in Figure 3. Thus 10 opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked 
   above the first opticalTransport IfEntry, and the other 10 
   opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked above the second 
   opticalTransport IfEntry.

    ifSpeed             Actual bandwidth of the interface in bits per
                        second.  If the bandwidth of the interface is
                        greater than the maximum value of 4,294,967,295,
                        then the maximum value is reported and 
                        ifHighSpeed must be used to report the 
                        interface's speed.

    ifPhysAddress       An octet string with zero length.  (There is
                        no specific address associated with the

    ifOperStatus        The operational status of the interface.  The
                        value lowerLayerDown(7) is not used, since
                        there is no lower layer interface.  This object
                        is set to notPresent(6) if a component is 
                        missing, otherwise it is set to down(2) if 
                        either the objects otnOTSnCurrentStatus or 
                        otnOMSnCurrentStatus has any value other than

                        to identify the physical or data entity 
                        associated with this interface or an 
                        OCTET STRING of zero length.  The 
                        enterprise-specific convention is intended to 
                        provide the means to reference one or more 
                        enterprise-specific tables.

   respectively. The example shows that j and k are stacked above (i.e.,
   multiplexed into) i. Furthermore, it shows that there is no layer 
   lower than i and no layer higher than j and/or k.

        The OPUk is the information structure used to adapt client 
        information for transport over an optical channel. OPUk 
        capacities for k=1, k=2, k=3 are defined in ITU-T. The index
        "k" is used to represent different versions of OPUk, ODUk and 
        OTUk. k=1 represents an approximate bit rate of 2.5 Gbit/s, 
        k=2 represents an approximate bit rate of 10 Gbit/s, and k=3 
        represents an approximate bit rate of 40 Gbit/s.

   Optical Multiplex Section Layer Network (OMS) - G.872
        This layer network provides functionality for networking of a 
        multi-wavelength optical signal. Note that a

        According to G.872, an OTN-compliant interface is an interface
        of the optical transport network based on the architecture
        defined in G.872, while an OTN-non-compliant interface is an

        consists of the optical channel data unit and OTUk related 
        overhead (FEC and overhead for management of an optical channel
        link connection).  It is characterized by its frame structure,
        bit rate, and bandwidth.

   Payload Type Transmitted (TxPL)
        The Payload Type signal of size of one byte in the OPUk overhead 
        position of the source of a trail for transmission. TxPL is 
        derived by the equipment from the active adaptation function. 
        If the equipment supports multiple adaptation functions, then 
        the adaptation function type can be provisioned by the managing 
        system. 

   Payload Type Accepted(AcPL)
        The Payload Type signal of size of one byte recovered (accepted)
        from the OPUk overhead position at the sink of a trail.

        the payload type signal received at the OPUk overhead position of 
        the sink for the purpose of checking the integrity of adaptation.
        ExPL is derived by the equipment from the active adaptation 
        function. If the equipment supports multiple adaptation 
        functions, then the adaptation function type can be provisioned 
        by the managing system.

3.5.2   Performance Parameters

   To facilitate the location of equipment that may require
   maintenance it is necessary to monitor measurements such
   as laser temperature and optical power at each layer. The
   measurements are taken periodically, 15 minute intervals,
   and a current snapshot of the value is also made available.

   Each performance parameter is monitored in a current 15
   minute interval. The current interval will monitor the
   most current measured value, the lowest measured value,
   and the highest measured value. An upper and lower threhold
   value is also typically provided for each parameter. At the
   end of the current 15 minute interval the values are
   transferred into the appropriate 15 minute interval
   representing the period within the Performance Monitoring
   Interval Table.

   All performance parameters are accumulated (stored) in 15 minute
   intervals from 4 up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) 
   by an agent with 32 intervals being the default.  Fewer than
   96 intervals of data will be available if the agent has been
   restarted within the last 24 hours. The NE keeps a record of
   the lowest value, highest value, and last measured value in
   each 15 minute interval.

   A Current and Previous 24 hour register will be maintained
   for each measured parameter. The current 15 minute interval
   is compared to the Current 24 Hour register and updated to
   reflect the lowest and highest values measured in the current
   24 hour period. The Current 24 Hour register is transferred
   to the Previous 24 Hour register along with the last measured
   value from the current 15 minute interval.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

   Performance parameters are of type Integer32, and it is used
   because it is possible for these objects to decrease, be negative.

   This internet draft does not define MIB objects for optical
   system cross-connects.  After consensus is reached on definitions
   of the interface MIB objects for optical systems (resulting from
   resolution of discussions on the objects proposed in this
   internet draft), work can progress on the definitions of
   tables to representing cross-connects (e.g., OCh optical 
   cross-connects and ODUk electrical cross-connects).

3.6 Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM)

   An ODUk termination can be provisioned to support (0..6) TCM levels.  
   Each TCM field contains the following subfields:
   -  Trail Trace Identifier (TTI)
   -  Bit Interleaved Parity 8 (BIP8)
   -  Backward Defect Indication (BDI)
   -  Backward Error Indication (BEI)
   -  Status bits indicating the presence of TCM overhead, Incoming 
      AlignmentError, or a maintenance signal (STAT).

   The insertion of these subfields is control by: 
   - optIfODUkTSourceMode or otnODUkTsinkMode
   
   The Detection and corresponding action of these subfields are 
   controlled by:
   - optIfODUkTTimDetMode
   - optIfODUkTTimActEnabled

   The TCM connection is used for monitoring the quality of an end to 
   end connection or any segment, as illustrated in the example:
   TCM1 used for the end-to-end connection from A1 to A2.
   TCM2 used for the segment B1-B2, then used again for the segment B3-B4.
   TCM3-TCM6 these bytes are not in used in this example.

   The TCM connection can be nested (B1-B2 is nested in A1-A2) or 
   cascaded (B1-B2 and B3-B4).

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information since,
   collectively, they allow influencing of interfaces in OTN equipment
   or networks and provide information of their configuration.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based
   Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
