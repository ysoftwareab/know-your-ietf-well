Abstract

   This document specifies algorithms for authenticated encryption with
   additional authenticated data (AEAD) that are based on the
   composition of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in the Cipher
   Block Chaining (CBC) mode of operation for encryption, and the HMAC-
   SHA1 message authentication code (MAC).  It also separately defines a
   generic composition method that can be used with other MACs and
   randomized ciphers.

   These algorithms are randomized, and thus are suitable for use with
   applications that cannot provide distinct nonces to each invocation
   of the AEAD encrypt operation.

1.  Introduction

   Authenticated encryption [BN00] is a form of encryption that, in
   addition to providing confidentiality for the plaintext that is
   encrypted, provides a way to check its integrity and authenticity.
   Authenticated encryption with Associated Data, or AEAD, adds the
   ability to check the integrity and authenticity of some associated
   data (also called "additional authenticated data") that is not
   encrypted.  This document defines two AEAD algorithms, using the
   interface defined in [M07], based on AES and HMAC-SHA1, with key
   sizes of 128 bits and 256 bits.

2.  A Generic Composition Method

   This section defines a particular "generic composition" method, using
   the the encrypt-then-MAC method defined in Section 4.3 of [AE].  The
   method describes how to make a randomized AEAD algorithm out of a
   randomized cipher, such as a block cipher mode of operation that uses
   a random initialization vector, and a MAC.

2.1.  Encryption

   We briefly recall the interface defined in Section 2 of [M07].  The
   AEAD encryption algorithm takes as input four octet strings: a secret
   key K, a plaintext P, associated data A, and a nonce N. An
   authenticated ciphertext value is provided as output.  The data in
   the plaintext are encrypted and authenticated, and the associated
   data are authenticated, but not encrypted.  The AEAD encryption
   process is as follows, or uses an equivalent set of steps:

   1.  The secondary keys MAC_KEY and ENC_KEY are generated from the
       input key K as follows.  Each of these two keys is an octet
       string.

       A.  MAC_KEY consists of the first MAC_KEY_LEN octets of K, in
           order.

       B.  ENC_KEY consists of the last ENC_KEY_LEN octets of K, in
           order.

       Here we denote the number of octets in the MAC_KEY as
       MAC_KEY_LEN, and the number of bits in ENC_KEY as ENC_KEY_LEN.

   2.  An Initialization Vector (IV) is generated uniformly at random,
       for use in the cipher.  (Note that this IV is distinct from the
       nonce that may be provided as an input to the authenticated
       encryption operation.)

   3.  The plaintext P is encrypted using the cipher with ENC_KEY as the
       key, and the IV generated in the previous step.  We denote the
       ciphertext output from this step as S, and it MUST include the IV
       as its prefix.

   4.  A message authentication code (MAC) is computed by applying the
       MAC to the following data, in order:

       A.  the nonce N,

       B.  the associated data A,

       C.  the ciphertext S computed in the previous step

       D.  the number of bits in N expressed as a 64-bit unsigned
           integer in network byte order,

       E.  and the number of bits in A expressed as a 64-bit unsigned
           integer in network byte order.

       The string MAC_KEY is used as the MAC key.  We denote the output
       of the MAC computed in this step as T.

   5.  The AEAD Ciphertext consists of the string S, with the string T
       appended to it.  This Ciphertext is returned as the output of the
       AEAD encryption operation.

   The encryption process can be illustrated as follows.  Here P, A, and
   C denote the AEAD plaintext, associated data, and ciphertext,
   respectively.

      S = ENC(ENC_KEY, P)

      T = MAC(MAC_KEY, N || A || S || len(N) || len(A))

      C = S || T

   Here ENC(X,P) denotes the encryption of P using the cipher with the
   key X; recall that the IV is included in its output.  The expression
   MAC(Y,M) denotes the application of the MAC to the message M, using
   the key Y. The concatenation of two octet strings A and B is denoted
   as A || B, and len(X) denotes the number of bits in the string X,
   expressed as an unsigned integer in network byte order.

2.2.  Decryption

   The authenticated decryption operation has four inputs: K, N, and A,
   as defined above, and the Ciphertext C. It has only a single output,
   either a plaintext value P or a special symbol FAIL that indicates
   that the inputs are not authentic.  The authenticated decryption
   algorithm takes is as follows, or uses an equivalent set of steps:

   1.  The secondary keys MAC_KEY and ENC_KEY are generated from the
       input key K as follows.  Each of these two keys is an octet
       string.

       A.  MAC_KEY consists of the first MAC_KEY_LEN octets of K, in
           order.

Internet-Draft           AEAD-AES-CBC-HMAC-SHA1            February 2007


       B.  ENC_KEY consists of the last ENC_KEY_LEN octets of K, in
           order.

       As above, we denote the number of octets in the MAC_KEY as
       MAC_KEY_LEN, and the number of bits in ENC_KEY as ENC_KEY_LEN.

   2.  The final T_LEN octets are stripped from C. Here T_LEN denotes
       the number of octets in the MAC, which is a fixed parameter of
       the AEAD algorithm.  We denote the initial octets of C as S, and
       denote the final T_LEN octets as T.

   3.  The integrity and authenticity of N, A, and C are checked by
       computing MAC validation algorithm, using the same inputs as in
       Step 5 of the encryption operation.  In the MAC-validation step,
       the message consists of N, A, the number of bits in N expressed
       as a 64-bit unsigned integer in network byte order, the number of
       bits in A expressed as a 64-bit unsigned integer in network byte
       order, as S, in that order.  The value MAC_KEY is used as the
       key.  The value T, from the previous step, is used as the correct
       MAC value for validation purposes.  If the MAC-validation
       operation indicates that the MAC T is valid, then the processing
       is continued.  Otherwise, all of the data used in the MAC
       validation are discard, and the AEAD decryption operation returns
       an indication that it failed, and the operation halts.

   4.  The value S is decrypted, using the first 128 bits of the
       ciphertext as the IV.  The value ENC_KEY is used as the
       decryption key.

   5.  The plaintext value is returned..

   The length of the ciphertext can be inferred from that of the
   plaintext.  The number L of octets in the ciphertext is given by

      L = 16 * ( floor(M / 16) + 2)

   where M denotes the number of octets in the plaintext, and the
   function floor() rounds its argument down to the nearest integer.
   This fact is useful to applications that need to reserve space for a
   ciphertext within a message or data structure.

3.  AEAD_AES_CBC_128_HMAC_SHA1

   This algorithm is randomized and stateless.  It is based on the
   "generic composition" of CBC encryption with HMAC authentication,
   with the the encrypt-then-MAC method defined in Section 4.3 of [AE].
   It uses the HMAC message authentication code [RFC2104] with the SHA-1
   hash function [SHA1] to provide message authentication.  Test cases
   for HMAC_SHA1 are provided in [RFC2202].  For encryption, it uses AES
   in the cipher block chaining (CBC) mode of operation as defined in
   Section 6.2 of [MODES], with the padding method defined by Appendix A
   of the same reference.

   The input key K is 36 octets long.

3.1.  Encryption

   The AES CBC IV is 16 octets long.  ENC_KEY_LEN is 16 octets.

   Prior to CBC encryption, the plaintext is padded by appending a
   single '1' bit to that data and then appending to the resulting
   string as few '0' bits as are necessary to make the number of bits in
   the plaintext into a multiple of 128.  Note that padding MUST be
   added to the data; if the number of bits in the payload data is a
   multiple of 128, then 128 bits of padding will be added.

   The plaintext is then encrypted using AES-128 in CBC mode, using
   ENC_KEY as the key and the random IV.  The IV is included in the
   ciphertext as its initial 16 octets.

3.2.  Message Authentication

   HMAC-SHA1 is used as the MAC.  MAC_KEY_LEN is 20 octets.  The HMAC-
   SHA1 output is truncated to 16 octets, by stripping off the final
   four octets.

3.3.  Decryption

   After CBC decryption, the padding is removed by deleting the final
   '1' bit and all of the following '0' bits.  The remaining data forms
   the plaintext.

   The HMAC-SHA1 validation operation consists of computing the HMAC-
   SHA1 value of the message, truncating it to 16 octets by discarding
   the final four octets, then comparing that value with the MAC value.
   If values are not equal, then the message is rejected.  Otherwise, it
   is accepted.

   The lengths of the inputs are restricted as follows:

      K_LEN is 36 octets,

      P_MAX is 2^64 - 1 octets,

      A_MAX is 2^64 - 1 octets,

      N_MIN is zero octets,

      N_MAX is 2^64 octets, and

      C_MAX is 2^64 + 47 octets.

3.4.  Test Cases

   A future version of this document will include test cases.

4.  AEAD_AES_256_HMAC_SHA_256

   AEAD_AES_CBC_256_HMAC_SHA_256 is like AEAD_AES_CBC_128_HMAC_SHA1,
   with the following differences:

      AES-256 is used instead of AES-128.

      HMAC-SHA-256 is used instead of HMAC-SHA1.

      ENC_KEY_LEN and MAC_KEY_LEN are each 32 octets.

      The input key length is 64 octets.

5.  Rationale

   The AEAD_AES_CBC_128_HMAC_SHA1 and AEAD_AES_CBC_256_HMAC_SHA_256
   algorithms are intended for use in applications that make use of the
   AEAD interface.  It is expected to be useful with cryptomodules that
   contain efficient implementations of AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA1, but which
   do not implement any other AEAD algorithms.  They are not intended to
   replace existing uses of AES-CBC and HMAC-SHA1, except in those
   circumstances where the existing use is not sufficiently secure or
   sufficiently general-purpose.

   One advantage of these algorithms is that they are suitable for use
   in applications that cannot provide distinct nonces to each
   invocation of the AEAD encryption operation.  In short, they can be
   used with zero-length nonces.  However, the algorithms can accept
   nonces; this ensures that they can be used with applications that are
   designed to work primarily with algorithms that expect nonces.  The
   nonce data is authenticated.

6.  Security Considerations

   This initial version of this document has not been reviewed;
   regarding security, it should be considered guilty until proven
   innocent.  Review has been requested from the IRTF Crypto Forum
   Research Group (CFRG).

   The algorithms defined in this document use the "generic composition"
   of CBC encryption with HMAC authentication, with the encrypt-then-MAC
   method defined in Section 4.3 of [AE].  This method has sound and
   well-understood security properties; for details, please see that
   reference.

   As with any block cipher mode of operation, the security of AES-CBC
   degrades as the amount of data that is process increases.  Each fixed
   key value SHOULD NOT be used to protect more than 2^64 bytes of data.
   This limit ensures that the AES-CBC algorithm will stay under the
   "birthday bound", i.e., that it is unlikely that there will be two
   AES plaintext inputs that are equal.  (If this event occurs,
   information about the colliding plaintexts is leaked, so it is
   desirable to bound the amount of plaintext processed in order to make
   it unlikely.)

   The nonce data is authenticated, as is expected in [M07].

   The lengths of the inputs and N and A are included in the MAC
   computation in order to prevent attacks in which an adversary
   constructs a forgery by manipulating N, A, and C in such a way that N
   || A | C are unchanged.
