Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


1.  Introduction

   The SIP Control Framework [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework]
   provides a generic template for establishment and reporting
   capabilities of remotely initiated commands.  The Framework utilizes
   many functions provided by the Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261]
   (SIP) for the rendezvous and establishment of a reliable channel for
   control interactions.  The Control Framework also introduces the
   concept of a Control Package.  A Control Package is an explicit usage
   of the Control Framework for a particular interaction set.  This
   specification defines a package for control of conference instances.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".  In addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   The following additional terms are defined for use in this document:

   Application server:  A SIP [RFC3261] application server (AS) is a
      control client that hosts and executes services such as
      interactive media and conferencing in an operator's network.  An
      AS controls the media server (MS), influencing and impacting the
      SIP sessions terminating on a media server, which the AS may have
      established for example using SIP third party call control.

   Media Server:  A media server (MS) processes media streams on behalf
      of an AS by offering functionality such as interactive media,
      conferencing, and transcoding to the end user.  Interactive media
      functionality is realized by way of dialogs, which are identified
      by a URI and initiated by the application server.

   MS Conference:  A MS Conference provides the media related mixing
      resources and services for conferences.  In this document, A MS
      Conference is often referred to simply as a conference.

   MS Connection:  A Media Server connection represents the termination
      on a media server of one or more RTP [RFC3550] sessions that are
      associated to a single SIP dialog.  A media server receives media
      from the output(s) of a connection and it transmits media on the
      input(s) of a connection.

   Media Stream:  A media stream on a media server represents a media
      flow between either a connection and a conference, between two
      connections, or between two conferences.  Streams may be audio or
      video and may be bi-directional or uni-directional.

3.  Overview

   The SIP Control Framework [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework]
   provides a generic approach for establishment and reporting
   capabilities of remotely initiated commands.  The Framework utilizes
   many functions provided by the Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261]
   (SIP) for the rendezvous and establishment of a reliable channel for
   control interactions.  The Control Framework also introduces the
   concept of a Control Package.  A Control Package is an explicit usage
   of the Control Framework for a particular interaction set.  This
   specification defines a package for basic conferencing.

   The scope of the package is control of media server functions for
   conferencing (e.g. create a conference, add and remove participants
   from it, etc) as well as responses and notifications related to these
   functions.  Although dialog services such as announcements,
   recordings, and prompts are generally needed for a complete
   conference service, those functions are defined in complementary
   packages.

4.  Control Package Definition

   This section fulfils the mandatory requirement for information that
   MUST be specified during the definition of a Control Framework
   Package, as detailed in Section 9 of
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework].

4.1.  Control Package Name

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify and register a unique name.  The name and version of this
   Control Package is "msc-conf-audio/1.0" (Media Server Control -
   Conferencing - Audio - version 1.0).

4.2.  Framework Message Usage

   The intent for the Conference Control package is for the creation,
   manipulation and deletion of conferences as well as joining,
   manipulation and unjoining of participants to conferences.  The
   Conference Control package is intended for use in an architecture
   where application logic and media mixing are distributed.  For this
   reason the Control Framework will operate in a manner where CONTROL
   messages, as defined in the Conference Framework
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework], MUST only be sent from the
   network entity providing the application logic.

   This package defines XML elements in Section 5 and provides an XML
   Schema in Section 7.

   The XML elements in this package are split into requests, responses
   and event notifications.  Requests are carried in CONTROL message
   bodies; <createconference> and <join> are examples of package
   requests.  See Section 5.1 for a complete enumeration of requests.
   Responses are carried either in REPORT messages or Control Framework
   200 response bodies; the <response> element is defined as a package
   response.  Event notifications are also carried in REPORT message
   bodies; the <event> element is defined for package event
   notifications.

   Note that package responses are different from framework response
   codes.  Framework error response codes (see Section 8 of
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework]) are used when the request or
   notification is invalid; for example, a request with invalid XML
   (400), or not understood (500).  Package responses are carried in 200
   response or REPORT message bodies.  This package's response codes are
   defined in Section 5.13.1.

   The schema uses "connection-id" and "conf-id" attributes which are

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   imported from schema defined in core Control Framework
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework].

4.3.  Common XML Support

   The Control Framework requires a Control Package definition to
   specify if the attributes for media dialog or conference references
   are required.

   This package requires that the XML Schema in Section 16.1 of
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] MUST be supported for media
   dialogs and conferences.

4.4.  CONTROL Message Body

   A valid CONTROL body message MUST conform to the schema defined in
   Section 7 and described in Section 5.  XML messages appearing in
   CONTROL messages MUST contain <createconference>, <modifyconference>,
   <destroyconference>, <join>, <modifyjoin> or <unjoin> request
   elements (Section 5.1).

4.5.  REPORT Message Body

   A valid REPORT body MUST conform to the schema defined in Section 7
   and described in Section 5.  XML messages appearing in REPORT
   messages MUST contain a <response> (Section 5.13), or a
   (notification) <event> element (Section 5.8).

5.  Element Definitions

   This section defines the XML messages for this control package.

   [Editors Note: since XML Schema may not be able to express all
   constraints expressed in these definitions, in cases where there is a
   difference in constraints, the definitions in the section take
   priority.]

5.1.  Requests

   The following request elements are defined:

   <createconference>:  create and configure a new conference - see
      Section 5.2 for detail.

   <modifyconference>:  modify the configuration of an existing
      conference - see Section 5.3 for detail.

   <destroyconference>:  destroy an existing conference - see
      Section 5.4 for detail.

   <join>:  create and configure media streams between connections
      and/or conferences (for example, add a participant to a
      conference) - see Section 5.5 for detail.

   <modifyjoin>:  modify the configuration of a joined media stream -
      see Section 5.6 for detail.

   <unjoin>:  delete a media stream (for example, remove a participant
      from a conference) - see Section 5.7 for detail.

5.2.  <createconference>

   <createconference> is used in a request by the AS to create a new
   conference (multiparty) instance.

   The <createconference> element has the following child elements
   defined:

   <audio-mixing>:  an element to configure the audio mixing
      characteristics of a conference (see Section 5.11.1 for more
      detail).  The element is mandatory in a <createconference>
      request.

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   <subscribe>:  an element to request subscription to conference
      events. (see Section 5.10 for more detail).  The element optional.

   <reserved-talkers>:  element represents the number of guaranteed
      speaker slots to be reserved for the conference.  The element is
      optional.

   <reserved-listeners>:  element represents the number of guaranteed
      listener slots to be reserved for the conference.  The element is
      optional.

   A media server MUST configure the audio mix of a conference as
   specified by the "<audio-mixing>" element or it MUST NOT create the
   conference and MUST report a 405 'Unable to configure audio mix'
   package level error.  A media server must create any subscriptions
   requested by the "<subscribe>:" element or it MUST NOT create the
   conference and MUST report a 406 'Unable to create subscription'
   package level error.  A media server MUST establish the reservations
   requested by any "<reserved-talkers>:" and "<reserved-listeners>:"
   elements or it MUST NOT create the conference and MUST report a 407
   'Conference reservation failed' package level error.

   The <createconference> element has the following attributes:

   conf-id:  string indicating a unique name for the new conference.  If
      this attribute is not specified, the MS creates a unique name for
      the conference.  The value is used in subsequent references to the
      conference (e.g. as conf-id in a <response>).  When present in a
      <createconference> request the new value of this attribute MUST be
      unique or else a 403 'Conference already exists' package level
      error will be reported.  The attribute is optional.

   Conferences SHOULD support subscription to the following events:

      active-talkers: the list of zero or more speakers that have been
      active during the previous interval.  The input and output
      parameters for event subscription and notification are given in
      the following tables.

   Subscribing to events is described in Section 5.10 and the
   notification of events is described in Section 5.8

   For example, a request to create a conference:

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   <createconference conf-id="conference11">
       <audio-mixing mix-type="nbest"/>
   </createconference>

   When a MS has finished processing a <createconference> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.13).

5.3.  <modifyconference>

   <modifyconference> is used by the controlling client to modify
   properties of an existing conference.

   The <modifyconference> element has the following child elements
   defined:

   <audio-mixing>:  an element to configure the conference (see
      Section 5.11.1 for more detail).  The element is optional in a
      <modifyconference> request.

   <subscribe>:  an element to request subscription to conference
      events. (see Section 5.10 for more detail).  The element optional.

   One or both of the elements <audio-mixing> and <subscribe> SHOULD be
   present in a <modifyconference> request.

   A media server MUST configure the audio mix of a conference as
   specified by any "<audio-mixing>" element or it MUST NOT modify
   anything and MUST report a 405 'Unable to configure audio mix'
   package level error.  A media server must create any subscriptions
   requested by the "<subscribe>:" element or it MUST NOT modify
   anything and MUST report a 406 'Unable to create subscription'
   package level error.

   The <modifyconference> element has the following attributes:

   conf-id:  string indicating the name of the conference to modify.
      The conference MUST be known by the receiving entity or else a 404
      'Conference does not exist' package level error will be generated.
      This attribute is mandatory.

   When a MS has finished processing a <modifyconference> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.13).

   [Editors Note: TODO - need to cover who to respond if modify is not
   successful]

5.4.  <destroyconference>

   <destroyconference> is used by the controlling client to destroy an
   existing conference.

   The <destroyconference> element does not specify any child elements.

   The <destroyconference> element has the following attributes:

   conf-id:  string indicating the name of the conference to destroy.
      The conference MUST be known by the receiving entity or else a 404
      'Conference does not exist' package level error will be generated.
      This attribute is mandatory.

   When a MS has finished processing a <destroyconference> request, it
   MUST reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.13).
   Successfully destroying the conference will result in a 200 package
   level response to the request.  Package level error responses do not
   result in the conference being destroyed.

5.5.  <join>

   <join> is used by the controlling AS to create one or more media
   streams either between a connection and a conference, between
   connections, or between conferences.  Streams may be audio or video
   and may be bi-directional or uni-directional.  A bi-directional
   stream is implicitly composed of two uni-directional streams that can
   be manipulated independently.  The streams to be established are
   specified by child <stream> elements (see Section 5.12).

   A MS MUST support <join>ing a participant connection to a conference.
   It MAY support <join>ing one connection to another connection, or one
   conference to another conference.

   Connections are created and destroyed on a media server using the
   Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261] (SIP).

   The <join> element has the following child elements defined:

   <stream>:   an element that both identifies the media streams to join
      and defines the way that they are to be joined (see Section 5.12).
      The element is optional.  If no <stream> elements are specified,
      then the default is the media configuration of the connection or
      conference.

   One or more <stream> elements may be specified so that individual
   media streams can be controlled independently; for example, audio
   only for transmission, but video only for reception.  It is an error

   if a <stream> element is in conflict with (a) another <stream>
   element, (b) with dialog, connection or conference media
   capabilities, or (c) with a SDP label value as part of the
   connection-id (see Section 16.1 of
   [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework]).

   The two entities to join are specified by the attributes of <join>.
   The <join> element has the following attributes:

   id1:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 16.1 of
      [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] The attribute is mandatory.

   id2:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 16.1 of
      [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] The attribute is mandatory.

   Note: Section 16.1 of [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] defines the
   semantics for a conference identifier but not its syntax.  Media
   server implementations need to distinguish between conferences and
   connections based upon the values of the "id1" and "id2" attributes.

   When an controlling client has finished processing a <join> request,
   it MUST reply with an <response> element (Section 5.13).  If the
   participant is already a member of the conference instance, a xxx
   package level response should be generated.

5.5.1.  Joining Model

   The <join> operation creates a media stream between a connection and
   a conference, between connections, or between conferences.  This sub-
   section describes the model of conferences and connections and
   specifies the behaviour for join requests to targets that already
   have an associated media stream.

   Conferences support multiple inputs and have resources to mix them
   together.  A media server conference in essence is a mixer that
   combines media streams.  A simple audio mix simply sums its input
   audio signals to create a single common output.  Conferences however
   use a more complex algorithm so that participants do not hear
   themselves as part of the mix.  That algorithm, sometimes called an
   n-minus mix, subtracts each participants input signal from the summed
   input signals, creating a unique output for each contributing
   participant.  Each <join> operation to a conference uses one of the
   conferences available inputs and/or outputs, to the maximum number of
   supported participants.

   A connection is the termination of a RTP session(s) on a media



Boulton, et al.         Expires September 3, 2007              [Page 14]

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   server.  It has a single input and output for each media session
   established by its SIP dialog.  The output of a connection may feed
   several different inputs such as both a conference mix and a
   recording of that participants audio.

   Joining two connections which are are not joined to anything else
   simply creates a media stream from the outputs(s) of one connection
   to the corresponding inputs(s) of the other connection.  It is not
   necessary to combine media from multiple sources in this case.  There
   are however several common scenarios where combining media from
   several sources to create a single input to a connection is needed.

   In the first case, a connection may be receiving media from one
   source, for example a conference, and it is necessary to play an
   announcement to the connection so that both the conference audio and
   announcement can be heard by the conference participant.  This is
   sometimes referred to as a whisper announcement.  An alternative to a
   whisper announcement is to have the announcement pre-empt the
   conference media.

   Another common case is the call centre coaching scenario where a
   supervisor can listen to the conversation between an agent and a
   customer, and provide hints to the agent, which are not heard by the
   customer.

   Both of these cases can be solved by having the controlling AS create
   one or more conferences for audio mixing and to join and unjoin the
   media streams as required.  A better solution is to have the media
   server automatically mix media streams that are requested to be
   joined to a common input when only the simple summing of audio
   signals as described above is required.  This is the case for both
   the use cases presented above.

   Automatically mixing streams has several benefits.  Conceptually, it
   is straight forward and simple, requiring no indirect requests on the
   part of the controlling AS.  This increases transport efficiency and
   reduces the coordination complexity and the latency of the overall
   operation.  Therefore, it is RECOMMENDED that a media server be able
   to automatically mix at least two audio streams where only the simple
   summing of signals is required.

   When a media server receives a <join> request, it MUST automatically
   mix all of the media streams included in the request with any streams
   already joined to one of the entities identified in the request, or
   it MUST fail the request and MUST NOT join any of the streams.  A
   controlling AS MUST use the <createconference> request for generic
   conferences where the complex mixing algorithm is required.

   Specifications which extend this package to handle additional media
   types such as text or video, MUST define the semantics of the join
   operation when multiple streams are requested to be joined to a
   single input, such as that for a connection with a single RTP session
   per media type.

5.6.  <modifyjoin>

   An AS uses <modifyjoin> to change the configuration of media
   stream(s) that were previously established between a connection and a
   conference, between two connections, or between two conferences.

   The MS MUST support <modifyjoin> for any stream that was established
   using <join>.

   The <modifyjoin> element has the following child elements defined:

   <stream>:   an element that both identifies the media streams to
      modify and defines the way that each stream should now be
      configured (see Section 5.12).  The element is mandatory.

   The <modifyjoin> element has the following attributes:

   id1:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 16.1 of
      [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] The attribute is mandatory.

   id2:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 16.1 of
      [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] The attribute is mandatory.

   The media server MUST configure the streams that are included within
   <modifyjoin> to that stated by the child elements.  It MUST NOT
   change the configuration of any streams not included as child
   elements.

   When an MS has finished processing a <modifyjoin> request, it MUST
   reply with an appropriate <response> element (Section 5.13).

5.7.  <unjoin>

   An AS uses <unjoin> to remove previously established media stream(s)
   from between a connection and a conference, between two connections,
   or between two conferences.

   The MS MUST support <unjoin> for any stream that was established
   using <join>.

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   The <unjoin> element has the following child elements defined:

   <stream>:   an element that identifies the media stream(s) to remove
      (see Section 5.12).  The element is optional.  When not present,
      all streams between "id1" and "id2" are removed.

   The <unjoin> element has the following attributes:

   id1:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 16.1 of
      [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] The attribute is mandatory.

   id2:  an identifier for either a connection or a conference.  The
      identifier MUST conform to the syntax defined in Section 16.1 of
      [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework] The attribute is mandatory.

   When an MS has successfully received a <unjoin> request, it MUST
   reply with a successful <response> element (Section 5.13).  If the
   participant is not identified as a member of the conference instance,
   a xxx package level response should be generated.

5.8.  Notifications

   Event notifications are specified in an <event> element.

5.8.1.  <event>

   Conference event notifications are either manual or automatic.

   Manual event notifications are defined when an controlling client
   subscribes to notifications for conference events using the
   <subscribe> element of <createconference> or <modifyconference>.  For
   information on the <subscribe> element, see Section 5.10.

   Automatic event notifications are defined as part of a Control
   Package.  The controlling client SHOULD NOT subscribe to these event
   notifications.  The MS MUST support these event notifications.  This
   package defines one automatic notification event: "conferenceexit"
   which indicates that a conference has terminated.  Note that this
   notification is not sent if the conference has been destroyed by the
   AS using a <destroyconference/> request.

   The <event> element has the following attributes:

   name:  string indicating the name of conference event.  The string is
      restricted to a sequence of alphanumeric or "." characters.  The
      attribute is mandatory.

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   conferenceid:  string identifying the conference.  The attribute is
      mandatory.

   The <event> element has the following child element:

   <data>:  an XML data structure (see Section 5.9) to pass additional
      information about the conference event.  The element is optional.

5.9.  <data>

   The <data> element is a general container for parameterized data.

   The <data> element has no attributes, but has the following child
   elements defined:

   <item>:  contains the following attributes:

      name:  a string indicating the name of the parameter.  The
         attribute is mandatory.

      value:  a string indicating the value of the parameter.  Multiple
         values of a parameters can be specified using space separation.
         The attribute is mandatory.

   Multiple <item> elements may be specified.

5.10.  <subscribe>

   The <subscribe> element is a container for specifying conference
   notification events to which a controlling entity subscribes.
   Notifications of conference events are delivered using the <event>
   element (see Section 5.8.1).

   The <subscribe> element has no attributes, but has the following
   child elements defined:

   <notify>:  contains the following attributes:

      name:  a string indicating the name of the event to be notified.
         The attribute is mandatory.

   The <notify> element may have a <data> child element.

   Multiple <notify> elements may be specified.

   For example, an AS that wants to subscribe to "active-talker" events
   but does not want to be notified more frequently than every 3 seconds
   could include the following as a child of either a <createconference>



Boulton, et al.         Expires September 3, 2007              [Page 18]

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   or <modifyconference> element:

   <subscribe>
      <notify name="active-talker">
         <data>
            <item name="interval" value="3s"/>
         </data>
      </notify>
   </subscribe>

   The MS would use the <event> element to send notifications to the AS.

5.11.  Conference Configuration

   The elements in this section are used to establish and modify the
   configuration of conferences.

5.11.1.  <audio-mixing>

   The <audio-mixing> element defines the configuration of the
   conference audio mix.  It has no child elements and has the following
   attributes:

   mix-type:  is a string indicating the audio stream mixing policy.
      Defined values are: "nbest" (where the N best participant signals
      are mixed) and "controller" (where the contributing participant(s)
      is/are selected by the controlling AS via an external floor
      control protocol).  The default value is "nbest".  The attribute
      is optional.

5.12.  Media Streams

   <join>, <modifyjoin> and <unjoin> require the identification and
   manipulations of media streams.  Media streams represent the flow of
   media between a participant connection and a conference, between two
   connections, or between two conferences.  The <stream> element is
   used (as a child to <join>, <modifyjoin> and <unjoin) to identify the
   media stream(s) for the request and to specify the configuration of
   the media stream.

   The <stream> element has the following attributes:

   media:  a string indicating the type of media associated with the
      stream.  It is strongly recommended that the following values are
      used for common types of media: "audio" for audio media, and
      "video" for video media.  The attribute is mandatory.

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   label:  a string indicating the SDP label associated with a media
      stream ([RFC4574]).  The attribute is optional.

   direction:  a string indicating the direction of the media flow
      between a dialog and its end point conference or connection.
      Defined values are: "sendrecv" (media can be sent and received),
      "sendonly" (media can only be sent), and "recvonly" (media can
      only be received).  The default value is "sendrecv".  The
      attribute is optional.

   When the "media" attribute has a value of "audio", the <stream>
   element has the following child elements defined:

   <volume>:  an element to configure the volume or gain of the media
      stream.  The element is optional.

   <clamp>:  an element to configure filtering and removal of tones from
      a media stream.  The element is optional.

5.12.1.  Configuring Volume

   The <volume> element is used to configure the volume of an audio
   media stream.  It may be set to a specific gain amount, to
   automatically adjust the gain to a desired target level, or to mute
   the volume.

   The <volume> element has no child elements but has the following
   attributes:

   controltype:  a string indicating the type of volume control to use
      for the stream.  Defined values are: "automatic" (the volume will
      be adjusted automatically to the level specified by the "value"
      attribute), "setgain" (use the value of the "value" attribute as a
      specific gain measured in dB to apply), "setstate" (set the state
      of the stream to "mute" or "unmute" as specified by the value of
      the "value" attribute).  The attribute is optional.

   value:  a string specifying the amount or state for the volume
      control defined by the value of the "controltype" attribute.

5.12.2.  Configuring Tone Removal

   The <clamp> element is used to configure whether tones should be
   filtered and removed from a media stream.

   The <clamp> element has no child elements but has the following
   attributes:

Internet-Draft         Conference Control Package             March 2007


   tones:  A list of the tones to remove.

5.13.  Responses

   Responses are specified in a <response> element.

5.13.1.  <response>

   Reponses to requests are indicated by a <response> element.

   The <response> element has following attributes:

   status:  numeric code indicating the response status.  The attribute
      is mandatory.

   reason:  string specifying a reason for the response status.  The
      attribute is optional.

   conf-id:  string identifying the conference (see Section 16.1 of
      [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework]).  The attribute is optional.

   connection-id:  string identifying the SIP dialog connection (see
      Section 16.1 of [I-D.boulton-sip-control-framework]).  The
      attribute is optional.

   The following status codes are defined:
