1. Introduction

   Overall, TRILL OAM (Operations, Administration, and Maintenance)
   meets the requirements given in [RFC6905]. The general framework for
   TRILL OAM is specified in [RFC7174]. The details of the Fault
   Management (FM) solution, conforming to that framework, are presented
   in [RFC7455]. The solution leverages the message format defined in
   Ethernet Connectivity Fault Management (CFM) [802.1Q] as the basis
   for the TRILL OAM message channel.

   This document uses the CFM MIB modules defined in [802.1Q] as the
   basis for TRILL OAM MIB and augments the existing tables to add new
   TRILL managed objects required by TRILL. This document further
   specifies a new table with associated managed objects for TRILL OAM
   specific capabilities.

2. The Internet-Standard Management Framework

Internet Draft               TRILL OAM MIB              October 12, 2015


   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4. Overview

The TRILL-OAM-MIB module provides an overall framework for managing
TRILL OAM. It leverages the IEEE8021-CFM-MIB and IEEE8021-CFM-V2-MIB
modules defined in [802.1Q], and augments the Maintenance End Point
(MEP) and MEP Db entries. It also adds a new table for TRILL OAM
specific messages. 


5. Structure of the MIB module

Objects in this MIB module are arranged into subtrees. Each subtree is
organized as a set of related objects. The various subtrees are shown
below, supplemented with the required elements of the IEEE8021-CFM-MIB
module.

5.1. Textual Conventions

Textual conventions are defined to represent object types relevant to
the TRILL OAM MIB.

5.2.  The TRILL OAM MIB Subtree

TRILL-OAM MIB Tree describe below consists of trilloamNotifications
(Traps) and trillOamMibObjects. The trilloamNotifications are sent to
the management entity whenever a MEP loses/restores contact with its
peer Flow MEPs.

The TRILL OAM MIB Per MEP Objects are defined in the trillOamMepTable.
The trillOamMepTable augments the dot1agCfmMepEntry (please see section
6.1) defined in IEEE8021-CFM-MIB. It includes objects that are locally
defined for an individual MEP and its associated Flow.

TRILL-OAM-MIB

  |--trillOamNotifications          (trillOamMib 0}

     |--trillOamFaultAlarm

  |--trillOamMibObjects             {trillOamMib 1}

     |--trillOamMep                 {trillOamMibObjects 1}

        |--trillOamMepTable         {trillOamMep 1}  - Local TRLL config

        |--trillOamMepFlowCfgTable

        |--trillOamPtrTable

        |--trillOamMtvrTable

        |--trillOamMepDbTable


5.3.1.  The Notifications Subtree

Notifications (fault alarms) are sent to the management entity with the
OID of the MEP that has detected the fault. Notifications are generated
whenever MEP loses/restores contact with its peer Flow MEPs.

5.3.2. The Table Structures

The TRILL OAM MIB Per MEP Objects are defined in the trillOamMepTable.
The trillOamMepTable augments the dot1agCfmMepEntry (please see section
6.1) defined in IEEE8021-CFM-MIB. It includes objects that are locally
defined for an individual MEP and its associated Flow.

5.3.2.1. trillOamMepTable Objects

Internet Draft               TRILL OAM MIB              October 12, 2015


   This table is an extension of the dot1agCfmMepTable. Rows are
   automatically added or deleted from this table based upon row
   creation and destruction of the dot1agCfmMepTable. 

   This table represents the local MEP TRILL OAM configuration table.
   The primary purpose of this table is provide local parameters for the
   TRILL OAM function found in [RFC7455] and instantiated at a MEP.


5.3.2.2. trillOamMepFlowCfgTable Objects

   Each row in this table represents a Flow Configuration Entry for the
   associated MEP. This table uses four indices. The first three indices
   are the indices of the Maintenance Domain, MaNet, and MEP tables. The
   fourth index is the specific Flow Configuration Entry on the selected
   MEP. Some write-able objects in this table are only applicable in
   certain cases (as described under each object below), and attempts to
   write values for them in other cases will be ignored.


5.3.2.3. trillOamPtrTable Objects

   Each row in this table represents a Path Trace reply Entry for the
   Defined MEP and Transaction. This table uses four indices. The first
   three indices identify the MEP and the fourth index specifies the
   transaction identifier. This transaction identifier uniquely
   identifies the response for a MEP, which can have multiple flow.

5.3.2.4. trillOamMtvrTable Objects

   This table includes managed objects for the Multi-Destination Reply.
   Each row in the table represents a Multi-destination Reply Entry for
   the defined MEP and Transaction. This table uses the following five
   indices: 1) Maintenance Domain, 2) MANET, 3) MEP tables, 4)
   Transaction identifier of selected MEP, and 5) receive order of
   Multi-destination replies.

   Some write-able objects in this table are only applicable in certain
   cases (as described under each object below), and attempts to write a
   value for them in other cases will be ignored.


5.3.2.5. trillOamMepDbTable Objects

   This table is an augmentation of the dot1agCfmMepDbTable, and rows
   are automatically added or deleted from this table based upon row
   creation and destruction of the dot1agCfmMepDbTable.

6. Relationship to other MIB modules

   The IEEE8021-CFM-MIB, and LLDP-MIB contain objects that are relevant
   to the TRILL OAM MIB. Management objects contained in these modules
   are not duplicated here, to reduce overlap to the extent possible.
   From the IEEE8021-CFM-MIB following objects are imported 

      o dot1agCfmMdIndex

      o dot1agCfmMaIndex

      o dot1agCfmMepIdentifier

      o dot1agCfmMepEntry

      o dot1agCfmMepDbEntry

      o Dot1agCfmIngressActionFieldValue

      o Dot1agCfmEgressActionFieldValue

      o Dot1agCfmRemoteMepState


   From the LLDP-MIB following objects are imported

      o LldpChassisId

      o LldpChassisIdSubtype

      o LldpPortId

6.1.  Relationship to the IEEE8021-TC-MIB

      In TRILL, traffic labeling can be done using either a 12-bit VLAN
      or a 24-bit fine grain label [RFC7172]. 

      The IEEE8021-TC-MIB definition of IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType
      includes the following two values:

      - 1 representing a vlanId, and

      - 2 representing a 24-bit isid 

      We have chosen to use value 2 for TRILL's fine grain label. As
      such, TRILL-OAM-MIB will import IEEE8021ServiceSelectorType,
      IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValueOrNone, and
      IEEE8021ServiceSelectorValue from IEEE8021-TC-MIB.

6.2. Relationship to the IEEE8021-CFM-MIB

   trillOamMepTable augments dot1agCfmMepEntry. Implementation of
   IEEE8021-CFM-MIB is required as we are augmenting the IEEE-CFM-MIB
   Table. Objects/Tables that are not applicable to a TRILL
   implementation have to be handled by the TRILL implementation back
   end and appropriate default values, as described in IEEE8021-CFM-MIB,
   have to be returned. 

   The TRILL OAM implementation doesn't support the Link Trace Message
   or Link Trace Reply since, as described in RFC7455, the Path Trace
   Message and Reply for unicast traffic and Multi-destination Tree
   verification Message and Reply for multicast traffic have been
   substituted for them. Statistics for these messages should default as
   per IEEE8021-CFM-MIB.

6.3.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   The following MIB module IMPORTS objects from SNMPv2-SMI [RFC2578],
   SNMPv2-TC [RFC2579], SNMPv2-CONF [RFC2580], IEEE-8021-CFM-MIB, LLDP-
   MIB.

8. Security Considerations

   This MIB relates to a system that will provide network connectivity
   and packet forwarding services. As such, improper manipulation of the
   objects represented by this MIB may result in denial of service to a
   large number of end-users.

   There are number of management objects defined in this MIB module
 


Kumar et al.             Expires April 14, 2016                [Page 43]

Internet Draft               TRILL OAM MIB              October 12, 2015


   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create. Such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.
   Support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have negative effect on sensitivity/vulnerability: 

   The following table and objects in the TRILL-OAM-MIB can be
   manipulated to interfere with the operation of RBridges by causing
   cpu use spikes:

   o trillOamMepTransmitLbmReplyIp allows the reply from a Loopback
   message to be transmitted to an IP address in the TLV thus allowing
   replies to be sent to any system to cause Denial of Service.

   o trillOamMepTransmitPtmReplyIp allows the reply from a Path Trace
   message to be transmitted to an IP address in the TLV and thus
   allowing replies to be sent to any system to cause Denial of Service.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmMessages allows the generation of PTM Messages and
   can be used to generate lots of cpu driven traffic.

   o trillOamMepTransmitMtvmReplyIp allows from reply from an MTV
   message to be transmitted to an IP address in the TLV and thus
   allowing replies to be sent to any system to cause Denial of
   Service.

   o trillOamMepTxMtvmMessages allows the generation of MTV Messages and
   can be used to generate lots of cpu driven traffic.

   The following objects in the TRILL-OAM-MIB are read-create and can be
   manipulated to interfere with the OAM operations of RBridges. If the
   number of OAM frames generated in the network is high, this can cause
   a cpu spike on destination Rbridges if Control plane policing is not
   properly implemented or configured on destination Rbridges.

   o trillOamMepTxLbmHC is used to set the Maximum Hop count for the LBM
   message. As OAM frame don't leak out of the TRILL network, it has no
   side effects.

   o trillOamMepTxLbmReplyModeOob is used to indicate whether the reply
   is in-band or out-of-band. This object's vulnerability is covered as
   part of trillOamMepTransmitLbmReplyIp.

   o trillOamMepTxLbmFlowEntropy is used to indicate the customer flow
   and find the exact path in the network. The creation of valid flows
   is its intended purpose. If invalid flows are created on vulnerable
   system they will be dropped in forwarding.

   o trillOamMepTxLbmDestRName is read-create but it's not vulnerable as

   invalid-name routes won't be present and will be rejected by the OAM
   application as part of normal processing.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmHC is used to set the Maximum Hop count for the PTM
   message. As OAM frame don't leak out of the TRILL network, it has no
   side effect.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmReplyModeOob is used to indicate whether the reply
   is in-band or out-of-band. This object's vulnerability is covered as
   part of trillOamMepTransmitPtmReplyIp.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmFlowEntropy is used to indicate the customer flow
   and find the exact path in the network. Creation of valid flows is
   its intended purpose. If invalid flows are created on vulnerable
   systems they will be dropped in forwarding.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmDestRName is read-create but it's not vulnerable as
   invalid-name routes won't be present and will be rejected by the OAM
   application as part of normal processing.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmStatus is required for normal PTM operation.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmResultOK is required for normal PTM operation.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmSeqNumber is required for normal PTM operation.

   o trillOamMepTxPtmMessages is required for normal PTM operation.

   o trillOamMepTxMtvmTree is required for normal MTVM operation.

   o trillOamMepTxMtvmHC is used to set the Maximum Hop count for the
   MTVM message. As OAM frame don't leak out of the TRILL network, it
   has no side effect

   o trillOamMepTxMtvmReplyModeOob is used to indicate whether the reply
   is in-band or out-of-band. This object's vulnerability is covered as
   part of trillOamMepTransmitMtmReplyIp

   o trillOamMepTxMtvmFlowEntropy is used to indicate the customer flow
   and find the exact path in the network. Creation of valid flows is
   its intended purpose. If invalid flows are created on vulnerable
   systems they will be dropped in forwarding.

   o trillOamMepTxMtvmStatus is required for normal MTVM operation.

   o trillOamMepTxMtvmResultOK, trillOamMepTxMtvmMessages,
   trillOamMepTxMtvmSeqNumber, and trillOamMepTxMtvmScopeList is
   required for normal MTVM operation.

   trillOamMepTransmitLbmReplyIp, trillOamMepTransmitPtmReplyIp, and
   trillOamMepTransmitMtvmReplyIp allow setting of the IP address to
   which reports are sent and thus it can be used for Denial of Service
   for that IP. 

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments. It is thus important to
   control GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the
   network via SNMP. For example, Path Trace messages expose the unicast
   topology of the network and Multi-destination Tree Verification
   Messages expose the multicast tree topology of the network. This
   information should not be available to all users of the network.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there
   is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access
   and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB
   module.

   Implementation should provide the security features described by
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model
   (USM)[RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].
   Implementations MAY also provide support for the Transport Security
   Model (TSM) [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as
   SSH [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353]. 

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, deployment of SNMPv3 with cryptographic
   security enabled is RECOMMENDED. It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give only those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) access to the objects.


9. IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

   Descriptor   OBJECT   IDENTIFIER  value
   ----------------------------------------
   trillOamMIB  { mib-2 xxx }

 


Kumar et al.             Expires April 14, 2016                [Page 46]

Internet Draft               TRILL OAM MIB              October 12, 2015


   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "xxx" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry. When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
