Abstract

   This document describes how we developed a SOAP-based NETCONF client
   and server.  In the case of using SOAP as a transport protocol of
   NETCONF, various kinds of development tools are available.  By making
   full use of those tools, developers' workloads are significantly
   reduced.  We developed an NMS (Network Management System) and network
   equipment that can deal with NETCONF messages sent over SOAP.  This
   document is aimed at providing knowledge about development guidelines
   gained from the implementation experience of a SOAP-based NETCONF
   client and server.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  NETCONF over SOAP

   This document is not a product from the NETCONF WG but a report on
   the experience acquired by individual developers.

   SOAP was specified in RFC4743[2] as one of the transport protocols of
   NETCONF.  SOAP is designed to use XML as its description language,
   which is a fundamental messaging technology of Web Service.  For this
   reason, SOAP is well suited to the NETCONF protocol and could be
   deployed widely.

   In the case of developing a SOAP-based NETCONF client and server,
   several development tools are available.  We developed a SOAP-based
   NETCONF client and server by using those development tools.  In this
   document, we provide information about our experience and guidelines
   of how to develop a NETCONF client and server so that even those who
   have little knowledge about SOAP can start developing a SOAP-based
   NETCONF client and server.

   The SOAP-based NETCONF client that we developed acts as an NMS.  The
   client is developed by utilizing Java APIs that are automatically
   generated from the XSD file and WSDL file obtained from RFC4741[1]
   and RFC4743[2], respectively.  The SOAP-based NETCONF server that we
   developed runs on network equipment and accepts NETCONF messages sent
   from the NETCONF client.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "must", "must not", "required", "shall", "shall not",
   "should", "should not", "recommended", "may", and "optional" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [3].

1.3.  Motivation

   This document describes why the authors believe SOAP is practical as
   a transport protocol of NETCONF in developing an NMS.  This document
   also describes the experience of implementing NETCONF over SOAP so
   that even those who have little knowledge about SOAP can start
   developing a SOAP-based NETCONF client and server.

2.  NETCONF Development on the Web Service Framework

   SOAP is a fundamental messaging technology of Web Service.
   Therefore, if we use SOAP as a transport protocol of NETCONF, network
   configuration performed by NETCONF is achieved on the Web Service
   framework.  In this section, we describe the overall architecture of
   Web Service.

               Figure 1: Overall architecture of Web Service

   As depicted in Figure 1, peripheral technologies around SOAP/HTTP are
   well developed.  Therefore, if we choose SOAP/HTTP as a transport
   layer of the NETCONF protocol, we do not have to develop each
   surrounding technology from scratch.  Hence, the development of a
   NETCONF-based NMS is relatively easy when we choose SOAP as a
   transport protocol of NETCONF.

2.1.  WSDL as an Interface Description Language

   WSDL (Web Service Description Language)[4] is defining how SOAP
   messages are exchanged among Web Service entities.  Interfaces of Web
   Service entities are automatically generated by development tools
   when importing a WSDL file.  Interfaces of Web Service entities
   generated in this manner act as APIs (Application Programming
   Interface).  Developers only need these APIs when developing an NMS,

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation             February 2008


   but SOAP is not needed.

   Useful development tools that can import a WSDL file are available
   with SOAP.  For instance, Apache Axis[5] will generate an interface
   from a WSDL file and act as a widely used SOAP implementation
   middleware.

2.2.  API as Programming Interface

   As described in the previous section, APIs are generated from a WSDL
   file by development tools such as Apache Axis.  APIs generated by
   Apache Axis are in the form of a Java library and act as programming
   interfaces for a NMS.  The NMS developed using those APIs can send
   SOAP messages to Web Service entities.

3.  Architecture of NETCONF over SOAP Implementation

   In this section, we describe the architecture of the NETCONF
   implementation using SOAP as its transport protocol.  The
   architecture of the NETCONF over SOAP implementation is shown in
   Figure 2.  A NETCONF implementation residing in an NMS works as a
   NETCONF client while network equipment acts as a NETCONF server.  In
   this document, we call NETCONF client and NETCONF server
   implementations a NETCONF application and NETCONF service provider,
   respectively.  A SOAP implementation needs to be installed on both an
   NMS and network equipment.  Each instance of the SOAP implementations
   exchanges SOAP messages based on the WSDL, as described in
   RFC4743[2].  If Java libraries generated from the WSDL are provided
   in the NMS, engineers can develop a NETCONF application, which
   configures network equipment via the NETCONF protocol, by utilizing
   the Java library.  There is no need for engineers to write directly
   in XML or SOAP.

   detail in both the NMS and network equipment.

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation             February 2008


3.1.  SOAP Implementation in NMS

   Several SOAP implementations capable of being installed on an NMS are
   available today.  Apache Axis is one of the widely used free SOAP
   implementations.

   Axis works as a SOAP implementation and a useful tool to develop an
   NMS.  For instance, WSDL2Java, one of Axis's tools, generates Java
   class files from a WSDL file.  Another tool called Java2WSDL does the
   opposite.  It generates a WSDL file from Java class files.  In
   conclusion, various kinds of benefits can be acquired if we introduce
   Axis as a SOAP implementation.

   To develop a NETCONF application that is capable of various functions
   such as releasing log messages, Java class files generated by the
   Axis tool need to be extended by adding more functions.  By utilizing
   these Java libraries, engineers can easily develop NETCONF
   applications.

3.1.1.  SOAP Parser in NMS

   The function of SOAP Parser is completely performed by a SOAP
   implementation such as Apache Axis.

3.1.2.  Session Maintenance in NMS

   When exchanging NETCONF messages between an NMS and network
   equipment, implementation of a session maintenance function is
   necessary on both sides.

   HTTP is a stateless protocol that is used as an underlying transport
   protocol of SOAP.  HTTP creates and kills a TCP session at every
   request.  Therefore, when using HTTP as a transport protocol of SOAP
   messages, session maintenance at the TCP-level as well as at the
   NETCONF-level is necessary.  Unless a session is maintained at the
   TCP-level, a different NETCONF service provider is invoked every time
   the NETCONF client sends a NETCONF message to the NETCONF server.  We
   used a Cookie field inside a HTTP header as a session identifier for
   the TCP-level session.

   The session maintenance function at the TCP-level has to be
   incorporated to work as follows.  After the NETCONF application sends
   a NETCONF hello message to a NETCONF service provider, the
   application receives a newly allocated session identifier written in
   the Cookie field of a replying hello message.  The NETCONF
   application preserves the Cookie paired with the network equipment
   MAC address and uses it as a session identifier for subsequent
   NETCONF message exchanges.  When an NMS sets the Cookie for

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation             February 2008


   subsequent NETCONF messages, the network equipment recognizes the
   session and maintains it.  The stored Cookie is erased when the NMS
   sends a close session message and a response message is received from
   network equipment.

3.2.  SOAP Implementation in Network Equipment

   SOAP must also be implemented in the network equipment to accept SOAP
   messages sent from the NMS.  Like the case of the NMS, some free SOAP
   implementations to be installed on network equipment are available
   today.  However, in the case of network equipment, the memory
   capacity might be limited.  Therefore, a SOAP implementation has to
   be chosen taking memory capacity into consideration.  In some cases,
   a memory-saving method will be required when implementing SOAP in the
   network equipment.

3.2.1.  SOAP Parser in Network Equipment

   When using HTTP as an underlying protocol of SOAP, a SOAP message
   consists of an HTTP header and a SOAP envelope.  The SOAP envelope is
   a necessary part of every SOAP message.  However, the SOAP
   encodingStyle attribute inside the envelope elements does not need to
   be specified.  When not specified, default the encodingStyle
   attribute of "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding" is applied.
   If there is a memory constraint, we can omit a parsing function of
   the encodingStyle attribute.

   Similarly, a SOAP header inside the SOAP envelope is defined as
   optional.  Therefore, the module that processes the SOAP header can
   be omitted if the memory capacity in the network equipment is
   insufficient.  After all, a SOAP parser in network equipment is
   allowed to parse only mandatory parts of a SOAP envelope.

3.2.2.  Session Maintenance in Network Equipment

   To maintain sessions with the NMS, SOAP implementation in network
   equipment must provide a session identifier to the NMS.

   The session maintenance function that we implemented works as
   follows.  When network equipment receives a NETCONF hello message
   from the NMS, the SOAP implementation in the network equipment sets a
   session identifier paired with the network equipment MAC address in
   the Cookie field inside the HTTP header and sends a response message
   to the network equipment.  When the network equipment receives a
   NETCONF close message from the NMS, the network equipment erases the
   stored session identifier.

4.  Guidelines of Developing NETCONF Client and Server

   This section provides guidelines on development of NETCONF clients
   and servers.  In the case of SOAP transport mapping, sharing what
   kinds of development tools are available would help developers start
   developing SOAP-based NETCONF clients and servers.  That would
   contribute to the rapid deployment of SOAP-based NETCONF clients and
   servers.

4.1.  Procedures of Development of NETCONF Client

   To develop a SOAP-based NETCONF client, generating stub code is
   necessary.  Stub is a library generated automatically from WSDL by a
   Web Service tool and acts as a group of APIs.  In the case of using
   Apache Axis as a Web Service tool, a generated stub is in the form of
   Java APIs.  Those Java APIs display interfaces of a Web service as if
   they are methods capable of configuring a local machine.

   The WSDL file named "netconf-soap_1.0.wsdl" is selected from
   RFC4743[2] specifies NETCONF messages to be exchanged between the
   NETCONF client and server.  Those NETCONF messages are the "hello"
   message and "rpc" message.  Therefore, stub codes of creating the
   "hello" message and "rpc" message are generated from "netconf-
   soap_1.0.wsdl".  However, the file "netconf- soap_1.0.wsdl" is not
   sufficient because no service element is specified.

   In "myNetconfService.wsdl", which is also selected from RFC4743[2], a
   service element is specified and "netconf-soap_1.0.wsdl" is imported.
   Stub codes generated from those WSDL files are found in files such as
   "Netconf.java", "NetconfLocator.java", and "NetconfBindingStub.java".

   When interfaces are used to operate NETCONF protocol in the manner of
   "get-config" and "edit-config", for example, a XML schema file named
   "netconf.xsd", which is selected from RFC4741[1], is used by being
   imported into "netconf- soap_1.0.wsdl".  Using the XML schema,
   methods of operating NETCONF protocol are generated in files such as
   "GetConfigType.java" and "EditConfigType.java", for example.

   When interfaces are used to configure network functions at network
   equipment, a data model of each network function has to be defined in
   the style of an XML schema.  The XML schema is required to be
   imported into "netconf-soap_1.0.wsdl" in the same manner as that of
   XML schema in [1].

   The connection between the NETCONF schema and data model should be
   made by inserting the following attribute into elements of each data
   model.  This attribute is defined in XML schema in [1].

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation             February 2008


   <xs:attribute name="operation" type="editOperationType"
   default="merge"/>

   In conclusion, using "myNetconfService.wsdl" to import "netconf-
   soap_1.0.wsdl", NETCONF schema, and the data model, we generate stub
   files containing interfaces to configure network equipment.

   The development environment needs to be arranged as well when
   generating stub codes.  The development of a Java-based NETCONF
   client needs JDK (Java Development Kit)[6] and Apache Axis.  In
   addition, using some IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as
   Eclipse[7] with Apache Ant[8] and NetBeans[9] would reduce the
   developer workload significantly.  When using Eclipse as an IDE,
   first, the library (*.jar files) of Axis has to be added to the
   development project build path as an external library.  The library
   of Axis acts as a SOAP library, so we do not need to be concerned
   about SOAP messaging when programming a NETCONF client using the
   library of Axis.

4.1.1.  Developing NETCONF Client without Eclipse

   Given that development of a NETCONF client is carried out in the
   environment of a Windows computer without Eclipse and
   "myNetconfService.wsdl" is placed in the directory of
   "C:\NetconfClient", stub is generated by executing the following
   command in the command prompt.

   C:\NetconfClient>java -classpath .;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\axis.jar;%
   AXIS_HOME%\lib\jaxrpc.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\saaj.jar;%AXIS_HOME%
   \lib\commons-logging-1.0.4.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\commons-discovery-
   0.2.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar
   org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java -p stub myNetconfService.wsdl

   In the directory where the WSDL file is located, the WSDL2Java
   command is executed.  Locations of each Axis library have to be
   specified.  The environment variable of "AXIS_HOME" is a directory
   where Axis is installed.  By executing the above command, files with
   an extension of "*.java" are generated in the "stub" directory, which
   is specified by the above command.  Inside the stub directory, we can
   find files such as "NetconfBindingStub.java", "Hello.java", and
   "GetConfigType.java", for example.

   Next, compilation of those files by executing the following command
   in the command prompt is necessary.

   C:\NetconfClient>javac -classpath .;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\axis.jar;%
   AXIS_HOME%\lib\jaxrpc.jar stub/*.java

   After the compilation of those java files, "*.class" files are
   generated.  At the time of compiling, we need to be careful about the
   encoding style.  After compiling, source code of the NETCONF client
   has to be written.  Source code of the NETCONF client is shown in
   Figure 3.  This NETCONF client is written by utilizing stub classes
   and interfaces, which are imported into the local package and
   referenced.

   public class NetconfClient {

           public static void main(String[] args) {

                   try{

                                   netconf.getnetconfPort(url);

                           URI[] uri = new URI[1];

                           stub.holders.HelloCapabilitiesHolder(uri);

                           UnsignedInt id = new UnsignedInt();
                           id.setValue(1);

   have to be incorporated at this stage.  Again, the NETCONF client is
   developed by compiling its source code.

4.1.2.  Developing NETCONF Client with Eclipse

   When we use Eclipse and Apache Ant, procedures described in the
   previous section are significantly simplified and executed at one
   time.  In this case, files named "build.xml" and "build.properties"
   are required for Apache Ant. Examples of "build.xml" and
   "build.properties" are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively.


   <?xml version="1.0"?>
   <project name="NetconfClient" default="all" basedir=".">
           <property file="build.properties"/>

                           <include name="*.jar"/>
                   </fileset>
           </path>
           <target name="prepare">
                   <mkdir dir="${destdir}"/>
           </target>
           <target name="stub" depends="prepare">
                   <java classname="org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java" fork
                           ="Yes">
                           <arg value="-o"/>
                           <arg value="${srcdir}"/>
                           <arg value="-p"/>
                           <arg value="${stub.stubdir}"/>
                           <arg value="${stub.wsdlpath}"/>
                           <classpath refid="axis-classpath"/>
                   </java>
           </target>
           <target name="compile" depends="stub">
                   <javac srcdir="${srcdir}" destdir="${destdir}"
                           encoding="UTF-8">
                           <classpath refid="axis-classpath"/>
                   </javac>
           </target>
           <target name="stub-jar" depends="compile">
                   <jar jarfile="${stub.jar}" basedir="${destdir}"/>
           </target>
           <target name="all" depends="stub-jar"/>
   </project>

               Figure 5: build.properties of NETCONF client

   The location of the WSDL file has to be specified in the
   "build.properties" file.  In the case shown in Figure 5, the location
   of the WSDL file is specified as being under the current directory.

   By running Apache Ant on Eclipse, steps specified in Figure 4 are
   taken.  First, stub codes are generated.  Then, compiling those stub
   codes is executed.  After the compilation, Apache Ant will generate a
   JAR (Java ARchive ) file, which is the output compressing all stub
   files (*.class) and acts as a library.  In this example, the name of
   "NETCONF.jar" is specified in Figure 5.  The "NETCONF.jar" file also
   has to be added to the build path of the development project used in
   Eclipse as an external library.

   After adding the "NETCONF.jar" file to the build path of the
   development project, we can write source codes of the NETCONF client
   by utilizing stub classes and interfaces.  Source codes like the one
   shown in Figure 3 can be written.  By running Apache Ant again, the
   source code of the NETCONF client will be compiled.  NETCONF client
   is developed in this manner.

4.2.  Procedures of Development of NETCONF Server

   In the Web Service framework, there are two approaches of developing
   a Web Service provider, namely NETCONF server in this case.  One is
   called the top-down approach, and the other is called the bottom-up
   approach.  The top-down approach is carried out by first designing a
   WSDL file, and then, skeleton source code from the WSDL file is
   generated by using a Web Service tool such as Apache Axis.  Generated
   skeleton code is just a template of the Web Service provider's source
   code.  Therefore, even though the Web Service provider's skeleton
   code works as its own, if additional functions were necessary,
   generated skeleton code would require additional source codes.  This
   approach is superior to the bottom-up approach in terms of
   interoperability because the specification is already defined in the
   WSDL file.  All vendors have to be compliant with the WSDL file.

   By contrast, the bottom-up approach is carried out by first creating
   a Web service from source code (e.g., Java bean) and then generating



Iijima, et al.           Expires August 24, 2008               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation             February 2008


   a WSDL file from the source code using a Web Service tool such as
   Axis.  This approach is faster and easier than the top-down approach.
   However, in the case of the bottom-up approach, ensuring
   interoperability becomes difficult since implementation of a Web
   service becomes vendor specific.

   In the case of developing NETCONF server, the WSDL file is already
   defined in [2], so there is no choice but to develop NETCONF server
   using the top-down approach.  The remainder of the section describes
   the top-down approach of developing NETCONF server.

   To develop a SOAP-based NETCONF server using the top-down approach,
   skeleton code is necessary.  Skeleton is a library, which is also
   generated automatically from WSDL by a Web Service tool.  In the case
   of using Axis as a Web Service tool, the generated skeleton is in the
   form of a Java library.  From the same WSDL file as that being used
   for generating stub code, skeleton codes are generated in files such
   as "NetconfBindingSkeleton.java", "Hello.java", and
   "GetConfigType.java", for example.

   The development environment needs to be arranged as well when
   generating skeleton codes.  When developing a Java-based NETCONF
   server, a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat[10] is necessary in
   addition to JDK and Axis.  The directory of "webapps\axis" under the
   Axis directory has to be copied to the directory of "webapps" under
   the Tomcat directory.

4.2.1.  Developing NETCONF Server without Eclipse

   Given that the development environment of NETCONF server is created
   in the environment of a Windows computer without Eclipse and
   "myNetconfService.wsdl" is placed in the directory of
   "C:\NetconfServer", skeleton is generated by executing the following
   command in the command prompt.

   C:\NetconfServer>java -classpath .;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\axis.jar;%
   AXIS_HOME%\lib\jaxrpc.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\saaj.jar;%AXIS_HOME%
   \lib\commons-logging-1.0.4.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\commons-discovery-
   0.2.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar
   org.apache.axis.wsdl.WSDL2Java -p skeleton -s -S true -d Session
   myNetconfService.wsdl

   In the directory where the WSDL file is located, a WSDL2Java command
   is executed.  Locations of each Axis library have to be specified.
   The environment variable of "AXIS_HOME" is a directory where Axis is
   installed.  By executing the above command, files with an extension
   of "*.java" are generated in the "skeleton" directory, which is
   specified in the above command.  Inside the skeleton directory, we



Iijima, et al.           Expires August 24, 2008               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation             February 2008


   find files such as "NetconfBindingSkeleton.java", "Hello.java", and
   "GetConfigType.java", for example.  Furthermore, files named
   "deploy.wsdd" and "undeploy.wsdd" are found.  "Deploy.wsdd" and
   "undeploy.wsdd" are used when deploying NETCONF server in a servlet
   container and undeploying NETCONF server from a servlet container,
   respectively.

   Then, adding source codes of NETCONF server functions to the skeleton
   codes such as "NetconfBindingImpl.java" is required as the need
   arises.  Functions such as releasing of log messages have to be added
   at this stage.  After that, by executing the following command in the
   command prompt, compilation of java files will be carried out.  That
   will generate "*.class" files.

   C:\NetconfServer>javac -classpath .;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\axis.jar;%
   AXIS_HOME%\lib\jaxrpc.jar skeleton/*.java

   NETCONF server can be developed by following these procedures.  Then,
   copying these class files into the directory of "webapps\axis\WEB-
   INFO\classes" of the Apache Tomcat directory is required.  Finally,
   deploying NETCONF server by executing the following command is
   required.

   C:\NetconfServer>java -classpath .;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\axis.jar;%
   AXIS_HOME%\lib\jaxrpc.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\saaj.jar;%AXIS_HOME%
   \lib\commons-logging-1.0.4.jar;%AXIS_HOME%\lib\commons-discovery-
   0.2.jar org.apache.axis.client.AdminClient -p 832 depoy.wsdd

   The command was executed in the directory where "deploy.wsdd" is
   located.  The file, "deploy.wsdd", was generated at the same time as
   generating the skeleton code.  After deployment, the NETCONF server
   receives NETCONF messages sent from the NETCONF client.

4.2.2.  Developing NETCONF Server using Eclipse

   When we use Eclipse and Apache Ant, procedures followed in the
   previous section are significantly simplified and executed at one
   time.  In this case, files named "build.xml" and "build.properties"
   are required for Apache Ant. Examples of "build.xml" and
   "build.properties" are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively.

   The locations of the WSDL file and "deploy.wsdd" file have to be
   specified in the "build.properties" file.  In Figure 7, the location
   of the WSDL file and "deploy.wsdd" file are specified as being under
   the current directory.

   By running Apache Ant on Eclipse, steps shown in Figure 6 are
   followed.  First, skeleton codes have to be generated.  After
   generating skeleton codes, adding source codes of the NETCONF server
   functions to the skeleton code is necessary depending on the function
   that developers intend to add.

   Then, by running Apache Ant again, compiling those skeleton codes is
   executed.  As a result, class files of NETCONF server will be
   generated.  Apache Ant will copy these class files to the directory
   of Tomcat and deploy the NETCONF server.  After that, NETCONF server
   will become accessible from the NETCONF client.  NETCONF server is
   developed in this manner.

4.2.3.  Developing NETCONF Server by C Language Programming

   When implementing NETCONF server on network equipment, memory
   capacity might be limited, so installing a Java environment on
   network equipment might not be attainable.  The network equipment
   platform might not support a Web Service tool.  In that case,
   implementation of SOAP as well as NETCONF server by using C
   programming on the network equipment may be necessary.

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation             February 2008


   To develop a NETCONF server capable of receiving NETCONF messages
   sent over SOAP/HTTP, the network equipment needs HTTP daemon and a
   NETCONF service provider.  A commonly used HTTP daemon can be used.
   A SOAP module needs to be added to the HTTP daemon as a connector
   between HTTP daemon and a NETCONF service provider.  The NETCONF
   service provider has to be developed to parse NETCONF messages sent
   from the NETCONF client and send reply NETCONF messages toward the
   NETCONF client.

   When an HTTP daemon receives a SOAP message that is sent over HTTP,
   the message is handed over to the SOAP module incorporated in the
   HTTP daemon.  Then, the SOAP module removes the SOAP header and
   passes NETCONF messages to the NETCONF service provider.  Then, the
   NETCONF service provider parses the NETCONF messages and configures
   the network equipment accordingly.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of RFC4741[1] and RFC4743[2] are
   applicable to this document.  Implementers or users of SOAP-based
   NETCONF clients and servers should take into account those
   considerations.

   As specified in the security considerations section of RFC4743[2],
   transport-level security, such as authentication of users and
   encryption of transport protocol, has to be ensured by TLS in the
   case of NETCONF SOAP binding.  That is, security has to be provided
   in the form of NETCONF/SOAP/HTTPS.
