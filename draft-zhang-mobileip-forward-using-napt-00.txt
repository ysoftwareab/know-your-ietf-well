Abstract

   Mobile IP's datagram tunnelling is inconvenient and complicated
   for mobile node or foreign agent.In CDMA2000 system,the PDSN acts
   as a foreign agent and it must do decapsulation work after receives
   datagrams from home agent to a mobile node away from home.The cost
   is big.

Internet-Draft   Forward Packets Using NAPT Method             June 2002   
   
   
   This document presents extensions to the Mobile IP protocol
   and a forwarding method using NAPT method instead of tunnel
   (IP-in-IP or GRE) when Home Agent forwards datagrams destined for
   the mobile node away from home. The term NAPT here is similar to that
   in RFC2663.For packets come from the host who initiates the session
   with the mobile node away from home,home agent would translate the
   source IP address, source transport identifier and related fields 
   such as IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP header checksums.Transport identifier
   can be one of TCP/UDP port or ICMP query ID.For packets come from
   the mobile node and them belongs to a established binding , 
   the destination IP address,destination transport identifier and the
   IP and transport header checksums are translated.Seen from the mobile
   node away from home,the session initiator is the home agent.So that
   the foreign agent need not do any decapsulation work,it just acts as
   a default router for the mobile node.

1. Introduction

1.1 Terminology

   The Mobile IP related terminology described in RFC 3220 [12] is used
   in this document.  In addition, the following terms are used:
   

      NAT
	 Network Address Translation is a method by which IP addresses
	 are mapped from one realm to another, in an attempt to provide
	 transparent routing to hosts. Traditionally, NAT devices are
	 used to connect an isolated address realm with private 
	 unregistered addresses to an external realm with globally
	 unique registered addresses.
      Session
	 A session is defined as the set of traffic that is managed as
	 a unit for translation.TCP/UDP sessions are uniquely identified
	 by the tuple of (source IP address, source TCP/UDP port, target
	 IP address, target TCP/UDP port).ICMP query sessions are
	 identified by the tuple of (source IP address, ICMP query ID,
	 target IP address). All other sessions are characterized by the
	 tuple of (source IP address, target IP address,IP protocol).

      Address lookup and translation
   	 Once a state is established for a session, all packets 
   	 belonging to the session will be subject to address lookup
   	 (and transport identifier lookup, in some cases) and
   	 translation.
   	 
      Network Address Port Translation (NAPT)
   	 NAPT extends the notion of translation one step further by also
         translating transport identifier (e.g., TCP and UDP port 
         numbers,ICMP query identifiers). This allows the transport 
         identifiers of a number of private hosts to be multiplexed into
         the transport identifiers of a single external address. NAPT
         allows a set of hosts to share a single external address.
         
         For packets come from the host who want to access the mobile
         node away from home,home agent(NAPT device) would translate the
         source IP address, source transport identifier and related
         fields such as IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP header checksums. 
         Transport identifier can be one of TCP/UDP port or ICMP
         query ID. For packets come from the mobile node,if it belongs
         to a established NAPT session , the destination IP address,
         destination transport identifier and the IP and transport 
         header checksums are translated.

1.2 Problem description
   As we know,the PDSN in wireless CDMA2000 system take the role of
   Foreign Agent.It MUST do de-encapsulation when receives datagrams
   tunnelling from Home Agent.
   
   What is needed is a easier way to forward the datagrams from home
   agent to mobile node away from home.
   
   
2. Forwarding datagrams using NAPT method Overview
   This section gives a brief overview of the forwarding mechanism 
   using NAPT method when home agent forwarding datagrams to mobile node
   away from home.
   
   A mobile node determines whether it is on its home network by using
   extensions to the ICMP Router Discovery Protocol(IRDP),a protocol 
   that uses router-advertisement and router-solicitation messages to
   discover the addresses of Home Agent on directly attached 
   subnetworks.Home Agent regularly advertise their existence.If a 
   mobile node picks up its own home agentí¯s advertisement, it knows
   it is on its home network and does not need to do anything special
   to receive its datagrams.If a mobile node receives an IRDP 
   advertisement from another mobility agent, it will register its
   location via a foreign agent or directly with its home agent,which
   in turn authenticates the device.
   
   Now if a host initiate a session with the mobile node away from home.
   the home agent intercepts the datagrams and establishes a binding. 
   home agent would translate the source IP address, source transport 
   identifier and related fields such as IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP header
   checksums.Transport identifier can be one of TCP/UDP port or ICMP 
   query ID.
   
   For datagrams come from the mobile node and them belongs to a 
   established binding,the destination IP address,destination transport
   identifier and the IP and transport header checksums are translated.
   
   If the initiator of a session is the mobile node away from home.The
   mobile node can use the care-of-address to send datagrams directly.
 
3. The change to Mobility Agent Advertisement Extension

   The Mobility Agent Advertisement Extension follows the ICMP Router
   Advertisement fields.  It is used to indicate that an ICMP Router
   Advertisement message is also an Agent Advertisement being sent by a
   mobility agent.  The Mobility Agent Advertisement Extension is
   defined in RFC3220 as follows:

   from home, once the mobile node has registered with its home agent.
   Here the foreign agent just act as a default router of the mobile 
   node.

                 source IP address and 
                 source transport identifier
                 and related fields.
                 The source IP address will 
                 be translated to the home
                 agent's IP address.If it is
                 a TCP/UDP session,then the
                 source port will be 
                 translated to a alias port
                 A binding be added to the
                 MIP NAPT Table.      
                 Then modify TTL to 255,and
                 recalculate the checksum.

   When the host initiate a session with the mobile node away from
   home networks.The home agent intercept the datagrams and add
   a binding into MIP NAPT table.
   The datagrams sent from mobile node when initiator is the host,then
   the datagrams will be received by home agent and be translated.
   
   So seen from the mobile node,the session inititor is not the host
   but the home agent.
