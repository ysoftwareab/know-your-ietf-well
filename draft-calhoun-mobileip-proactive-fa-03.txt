Abstract

   The Mobile IP protocol allows a Mobile Node to continue using the
   same home address even after changing its point of attachment to the
   Internet.  This provides transparency to most existing applications
   that assume a fixed address and a fixed point of attachment.
   However, new applications, such as voice-over-IP, have additional
   real-time requirements such that a change in the point of attachment
   will cause a noticeable degradation of service unless additional
   steps are taken to reduce the latency of a handoff event.

   This specification proposes extensions to the Mobile IP protocol that
   may be used by Foreign Agents to set up a Mobile Node's visitor
   entry, and forward its packets, prior to receiving a formal
   Registration Request from the Mobile Node.  This enables a very rapid
   establishment of service at the new point of attachment so that the
   effect of the handoff on real-time applications is minimized.

1.0  Introduction

   This specification proposes extensions to the Mobile IP protocol that
   may be used by Foreign Agents to set up a Mobile Node's visitor
   entry, and forward its packets, prior to receiving a formal
   Registration Request from the Mobile Node.  This enables a very rapid
   establishment of service at the new point of attachment so that the
   effect of the handoff on real-time applications is minimized. The
   proposed extensions make a few minimal assumptions about support
   available from the link layer. These assumptions are fairly broad and
   abstract.  Although they address the kinds of link layer support
   available in existing radio link layers, the assumptions are not
   based on any specific radio link protocol.

   The extensions handle both intra-domain and inter-domain handoff.
   While intra-domain handoff MAY make use of pre-configured security
   associations between Mobility Agents, inter-domain handoffs MAY make
   use of the AAA infrastructure. In the case of inter-technology
   handoff, active involvement by the mobile is necessary to switch from
   one network interface to another; however, the delivery of the agent
   advertisements, indicating the availability of a mobility agent on a
   new network interface, is still controlled by network assisted
   handoff.

   In summary, this draft covers a hand-off scenario not addressed by
   RFC 2002: that of a pro-active, network-controlled, anchor-chained
   hand-off.


1.1  Requirements language

   In this document, the key words "MAY", "MUST, "MUST NOT", "optional",
   "recommended", "SHOULD", and "SHOULD NOT", are to be interpreted as
   described in [4].


1.2  Terminology

   This document frequently uses the following terms:

      AAA
         Authentication, accounting and authorization.

      Anchor Foreign Agent (AFA)
         A foreign agent with publicly routable IP address that acts as
         an anchor point when a mobile moves to a new foreign agent.
         Upon successful global registration (registration with home
         agent) of a mobile node, the anchor foreign agent supports

         local registration when the mobile node changes its point of
         attachment to some other neighboring foreign agents.

      cdma2000
         This is a wide-band radio transmission technology standard,
         that uses CDMA(code division multiple access) technology, to
         meet the demands of a third-generation wireless communication
         system.

      Connection ID
         A number used to differentiate different link layer connections
         originated from the same device.

      Dormant mode
         Certain wireless technologies support dormancy, which allows
         the mobile to go into power saving mode. This typically occurs
         when the mobile has been idle for some time, but could be
         initiated by the network.

      Foreign Agent IP Address Derivation
         The derivation of the IP address of a source foreign agent or a
         target foreign agent based on the receipt of a link layer
         trigger at the target foreign agent or the source foreign agent
         respectively.

      Gateway Foreign Agent(GFA)
         A foreign agent with publicly routable IP address that acts as
         a concentration point for other foreign agents within an
         administrative domain. Upon successful global registration
         (registration with Home agent) of a mobile node, the GFA
         supports local registration when the mobile node changes its
         point of Attachment to some other foreign agent of the same
         administrative Domain.

      Home Domain
         The domain where the home network [1] and home agent [1] are
         located.

      International Mobile Subscriber information (IMSI)
         A number used for identifying a mobile subscriber station.

      Link layer
         A link layer specifies a protocol used by communicating nodes
         to exchange information over a physical link. A mobile node
         attaches itself to a mobile access network, before it can be
         served by a foreign agent. A mobile node's link layer address
         is the media access control(MAC) address of the mobile node's
         network interface.

      Mobility Agent
         A foreign agent or a home agent. The foreign agent types
         include an anchor foreign agent and a gateway foreign agent.

      Mobility Advertisement
         An advertisement message constructed by attaching a special
         extension to a router advertisement message.

      Movement Detection
         A detection of a movement in the link layer attachement of the
         mobile node to a mobile access network.

      Ping-Pong Handoff
         The rapid oscillation of a mobile node among coverage area of
         two or more foreign agents.

      Proactive Foreign agent
         A foreign agent that initiates mobile/IP registration on behalf
         of a mobile node due to reception of some link layer trigger
         event.

      Source Trigger
         A signal received by the source foreign agent mobile/IP stack,
         via the link layer, when the mobile node departs from the
         serving area of the source foreign agent.

      Target Trigger
         A signal received by the target foreign agent mobile/IP stack,
         via the link layer, when the mobile node arrives at the serving
         area of the target foreign agent.

      Trigger
         The link layer signal used by wireless link layer to inform
         inter foreign agent handoff event to Mobile/IP stack.

      Visited Domain
         An administrative domain, visited by a Mobile IP client, and
         containing the AAA infrastructure needed to carry out the
         necessary operations enabling Mobile IP registrations.  From
         the point of view of the foreign agent, the foreign domain is
         the local domain.


1.2  Fast handoffs

   MNs connect to FAs via direct, link-layer connections. Because an FA
   is directly connected to the link-layer, it may obtain link-layer
   information such as power measurements that might indicate the



Calhoun et al.              expires May 2001                    [Page 6]





INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2000


   necessity of a hand-off to a new FA. The FA can also gain assurance
   of the MN's identity through link-layer authentication, and can
   authenticate the stream of traffic coming from the MN, including any
   power measurements or other indications used for hand-off.

   In this document, we will assume that the link-layer events are
   signaled to the Foreign Agent as "triggers". The acquisition of a
   "trigger" to signal that a hand-off is necessary may be more
   difficult when the technologies differ. We assume that any such
   triggers will be sufficient to derive the IP addresses of the Foreign
   Agents that will receive or send the hand-off. If such a trigger is
   not available or if the MN decides on its own that a hand-off is to
   take place, then one of the FAs can often still derive the identity
   (IP address) of the other from link-layer messages.

   In order for the Mobile IP protocol to provide fast hand-off, the
   following problems must be addressed:

      1. Reducing the latency involved in the registration process.
         Although optimization of the Registration process is not
         typically considered a Hand-Off problem, this proposal assumes
         that such a mechanism is in place.
      2. Reducing the latency involved in the Mobile Node's movement
         detection process.
      3. "Bi-casting" the Mobile Node's traffic to two (or more) points
         of attachment, ensuring that the mobile's traffic is delivered
         as soon as the link layer hand-off is completed.
      4. Support for Reverse Tunneling, which MAY be required for
         private addresses.
      5. The Security Relationships between the mobility entities for
         inter-domain hand-offs.
      6. Does not increase mobile power consumption


2.0  Registration Latency

   The Mobile IP protocol [1] requires that a Mobile Node registers with
   a Foreign Agent, and subsequently its Home Agent, in order to have
   its packets delivered to its current point of attachment. The Mobile
   IP Regional Registration [6] specification proposes optimized
   registration approaches using two different methods:

      1. Gateway Foreign Agents (GFA), which are mobility agents that
         act as concentration points for Foreign Agents within an
         Administrative Domain.
      2. Anchor Foreign Agents (AFA), where a previously used Foreign
         Agent becomes an anchor point when a mobile moves to a new
         Foreign Agent.

INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2000


   Both GFAs and AFAs allow a Mobile Node's registration message to be
   processed by a Mobility Agent in the local domain, eliminating the
   need to contact the Home Agent, which MAY be topologically distant.


2.1  Gateway Foreign Agents

   The Mobile IP Regional Registration specification introduces the
   Gateway Foreign Agent (GFA), as a mobility agent that two Foreign
   Agents providing service to a Mobile Node have in common. Figure 1
   provides an example of a Mobile's initial registration, through the
   GFA. Given this is the first registration message, the message MUST
   be forwarded to the Home Agent. All packets destined for the mobile
   will be delivered to the GFA, which in turn will forward the packets
   to the Foreign Agent servicing the Mobile Node.

                           +-----+
               Figure 1 - Initial Registrations through GFA

   In the event that the mobile moves to a new Foreign Agent that is
   serviced by a GFA that is common with oFA, the Mobile Node MAY issue
   a Regional Registration Request (see Figure 2). The Regional
   Registration message does not need to be forwarded to the Home Agent,
   since the mobile's traffic can still be delivered to the same GFA.
   This optimized approach effectively reduces the latency involved in
   the registration process.

2.2  Anchor Foreign Agent

   The Mobile IP Regional Registration specification introduces what
   this document will call the Anchor Foreign Agent, which is similar to
   [7]. The Anchor Foreign Agent operates very similarly to the GFA,
   with the exception that the mobile's old Foreign Agent acts as an
   anchor point for the Mobile Node.

   In order to minimize the latency involved in the registration
   process, the Mobile Node MAY issues a Regional Registration message,
   setting the old Foreign Agent as the GFA, as shown in Figure 3. Once
   completed, the Mobile Node MAY issue an additional RFC 2002 compliant
   Registration Messages to eliminate the routing leg through the anchor
   Foreign Agent.

3.0  Movement Detection

   The Mobile IP protocol [1] and the Regional Registration extension
   [6] require Mobile Nodes to listen for, or solicit, advertisements in
   order to detect that a movement to a new IP subnet has occurred. This

INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2000


   movement detection mechanism introduces significant latency into the
   hand-off process, which causes service degradation, especially for
   real-time services. Service is further impacted given the additional
   latency introduced through the registration process that follows the
   movement detection, since the mobile's traffic can only be delivered
   once all of the registration has completed.

   There have been many solutions proposed to solve this problem,
   including increasing the advertisement frequency. In networks where
   radio spectrum is expensive or bandwidth is limited, the additional
   signaling required for increasing advertisement frequency is a
   serious issue impacting deployability.

   In this document, we propose that the Foreign Agent take a pro-active
   approach and issue the Handoff messages on behalf of the Mobile Node
   (acting as a surrogate of sorts). When a Foreign Agent is aware that
   a hand-off is occurring at the link-layer, a trigger is sent to the
   Mobile IP protocol stack.

   A source trigger (see Figure 4) is one that is obtained by the old
   Foreign Agent (oFA) once the link layer detects that the Mobile Node
   is departing its coverage area. A target trigger (see Figure 5), on
   the other hand, is one that is obtained by the new Foreign Agent
   (nFA) once the link layer detects that the Mobile Node is arriving in
   its coverage area. Note that both triggers may be available before
   the actual completion of the link layer handoff.

   The messages depicted in both Figures 4 and 5 are very similar. The
   main difference is the initiator of the Handoff Request message. In
   both examples, an optional Gateway Foreign Agent is used, which

   requires the use of the Regional Registration messages [6].

   In both the source and target triggers, a Foreign Agent obtains
   link-layer information, such as power measurements, that indicate the
   necessity of a handoff to the new Foreign Agent.

   In the event of a source trigger, oFA transmits a Handoff Request
   message to nFA. The Handoff Request MUST include the Mobile Node's
   Home Address, Home Agent Address, remaining registration lifetime, as
   well as the Link-Layer Address Extension (see Section 10). The GFA's
   identity MUST also be present, if one was used for the Mobile Node's
   registration. Upon receipt of the message, nFA MUST create the Mobile
   Node's visitor entry, and respond with the Handoff Reply message.

               Figure 5 - Target Trigger Pro-Active Handoff

   In target triggers, the trigger occurs on nFA, which results in the
   transmission of a Handoff Request to oFA. The Handoff Request message
   MUST include the Mobile Node's Link-Layer Address (see Section 10) in
   order for oFA to correctly identify the Mobile Node. The request
   message MAY include additional Mobile Node information, if such
   information was provided by the link layer. Upon receipt of the
   request, oFA MUST respond with the Handoff Reply message, which
   includes the Mobile Node's Home Address, Home Agent Address,
   remaining registration lifetime and Link-Layer Address Extension. If
   a GFA was used in the Mobile Node's registration, it's address MUST
   be supplied.

   Regardless of the direction of the Handoff Request, if nFA receives
   GFA information within the message from oFA, it SHOULD issue a
   Regional Registration Request with the GFA, which will respond with
   the Regional Registration Reply.

3.1  Ping-Pong effect

   Some link-layers are subject to rapid motion of MNs between two FAs.
   For example, even though link-layer power measurements may indicate
   that a hand-off is necessary, the mobile may fail to attach to the
   new point of attachment, and return almost immediately to its old
   point of attachment. This event is known as a "ping-pong" effect.

   Figure 6 provides an example of bi-casting a Mobile Node's through
   both the old and new Foreign Agents. Bi-casting is established when
   the oFA issues a successful Handoff Reply to nFA, or receives a
   successful Handoff Reply from nFA. This causes oFA to forward all of
   the Mobile Node's traffic to the nFA, as well as to the Mobile Node,
   if a link-layer channel exists.

   Figure 7 provides an example where bi-casting is performed on the
   Gateway Foreign Agent, which is initiated by nFA setting the 'S' bit
   (Simultaneous Binding) in the Regional Registration Request.

   occurs, the mobile's service is guaranteed not to experience any
   additional latency beyond that imposed by the link-layer handoff.


4.0  Reverse Tunneling Support

   In the event the Mobile Node requested Reverse Tunneling [12]
   support, by setting the 'T' bit in its Registration Request, the
   Handoff message from oFA (see Sections 8.0 and 9.0) includes the 'T'
   bit enabled to inform nFA to establish a bi-directional tunnel for
   the visitor entry.


5.0  Security Relationships

   The Mobile IP Regional Registration specification [6] requires that
   the communicating Mobility Agents exchange authenticated messages.
   This imposes a requirement for Mobility Agents to share a pre-
   established security association. This assumption is valid for
   intra-domain mobility (mobility within an Administrative Domain).
   However, such a requirement introduces a scaling problem when the
   Mobility Agents are owned by separate Administrative Domains (ADs).

   Given that the existing AAA infrastructure is used to establish
   dynamic security associations between Foreign and Home Agents in
   different ADs, the same infrastructure could be used to establish the
   required security association for the purposes of inter-domain hand-
   offs (see Figure 8).

   Agents owned by different Administrative Domains to have a pre-
   established security association, which would reduce the latency
   introduced by the AAA infrastructure traversal. Given that such
   geographically neighboring FAs MAY be small in number, such an
   approach MAY be reasonable.


6.0  Power Consumption

   An additional benefit that derives from this proposal is the
   potential for tracking mobile nodes while in dormant mode, if the
   radio link supports it, allowing significant power saving without
   adding additional complexity to the network layer protocol in the
   wired network. One of the primary innovations proposed here, namely
   to allow the Foreign Agents to set up visitor entries prior to the
   Mobile Node's registration, is also useful for power saving. Certain
   radio link layers allow the mobile node to enter dormant mode when
   idle. Allowing the network to control the handoff ensures that the
   mobiles do not have to be removed out of dormant mode in order to
   establish a Mobile IP handoff.

   Limiting power consumption is a requirement for certain wireless
   Standards Defining Organizations (SDOs), and a Mobile IP fast handoff
   proposal MUST satisfy this requirement.


7.0  Operation

   A Foreign Agent can receive two different types of triggers informing
   it of a handoff (The event that causes the trigger may be derived via
   link layer messaging assistance from the network or from the mobile):

       - a "source trigger" is when the old FA is informed of an
         upcoming link-layer handoff,
       - a "target trigger" occurs at the new FA when it is informed
         that a link layer handoff is in progress.

   The method by which such triggers occur are link-layer specific, and
   are outside the scope of this document. It is also possible that a
   particular kind of link layer technology can support both source and
   target triggers.


7.1  Foreign Agent Considerations

   Upon receipt of a trigger event, a Foreign Agent MAY issue a Handoff
   request message to the Foreign Agent the mobile is being handed off
   to/from.  If the message is the result of a target trigger, the Type



Calhoun et al.              expires May 2001                   [Page 14]





INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2000


   Of Trigger bit MUST be set and the Link-Layer Address Extension (see
   Section 10) MUST be present. The message's Home Address and Home
   Agent Address fields MAY be set to NULL if this information is not
   known at the time the message is transmitted.

   Upon receipt of a Handoff Request message with the Type Of Trigger
   bit set, a Foreign Agent MUST respond with the Handoff Reply message.
   The Handoff Reply MUST include both the Mobile Node's Home Address
   and Home Agent Address in the message header. The remaining mobile's
   registration lifetime MUST be included in the Reply's lifetime field.
   Furthermore, the Foreign Agent MAY include any security associations
   that were dynamically created, an example of such security
   associations are those described in [8]. If a Gateway Foreign Agent
   was used in the Mobile's registration, the GFA's identity MUST be
   included in the Gateway Foreign Agent Address Extension [6] MUST be
   present.

   A Foreign Agent that issues such a Handoff Reply with the Code field
   set to success (zero value) MUST "bi-cast" all packets destined to
   the Mobile Node to both the Mobile Node and to the new Foreign Agent.

   The Foreign Agent that receives a successful Handoff Reply message
   (one that includes a zero value in the Code field), a visitor entry
   is created with the information found in the message. The Foreign
   Agent MUST be prepared to deliver packets to the Mobile Node prior to
   receiving a Registration Request [1] from the Mobile Node.

   Note that it is possible for the encapsulation method used between
   oFA and nFA to be different from the one requested by the Mobile Node
   during its Registration process. When this occurs, the respective
   Foreign Agents MUST perform encapsulation translation.

   A Foreign Agent that receives a source trigger, it MUST send a
   Handoff Request message with the Type Of Trigger bit disabled.  The
   message MUST also include the Mobile Node's Home Address and Home
   Agent Address in the message header. The remaining mobile
   registration lifetime MUST be included in the lifetime field. The
   Foreign Agent MAY also include any security associations that were
   dynamically created (see [8] for an example). If a Gateway Foreign
   Agent was used for the mobile, it's identity MUST be included in the
   Gateway Foreign Agent Address Extension [6].

   Upon receipt of a Handoff Request with the Type Of Trigger bit
   disabled, a Foreign Agent MUST process the packet and respond with
   the Handoff Reply message. If successfully processed, the Foreign
   Agent MUST create a Visitor Entry for the Mobile Node, and be
   prepared to deliver packets received by the initiator of the Handoff
   Request destined for the Mobile Node. The Handoff Reply message MUST



Calhoun et al.              expires May 2001                   [Page 15]





INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2000


   include the Home Address, Home Agent Address, lifetime value, and the
   Link-Layer Address Extension (see Section 10).

   A Foreign Agent that receives a Handoff Reply with the Code field set
   to success (zero value) MUST "bi-cast" all packets destined to the
   Mobile Node to both the Mobile Node and to the new Foreign Agent.

   If the message received by the new Foreign Agent contained a GFA IP
   Address Extension [6], and it shares a security association with the
   GFA, it MUST issue a Regional Registration Request to the GFA. The
   Regional Registration Request's Care-Of address field MUST be set to
   the local Foreign Agent's address, while the GFA IP Address MUST be
   set to the address of the recipient of the request. The request's
   lifetime field is set to an administratively configured value. A
   successful Regional Registration Reply MUST cause the Foreign Agent
   to create a visitor entry for the Mobile Node.

   If a Regional Registration Reply message is received with the code
   field set to DO_NOT_SERVICE_MN (Section 11), the Foreign Agent SHOULD
   NOT provide service to the Mobile Node. The Foreign Agent MAY enforce
   this by closing the Link-Layer connection (if possible), not issuing
   any Mobility Advertisements to the Mobile Node (assuming a point-to-
   point Link Layer), or simply denying all Registration Requests with
   the error code set to 65 (Administratively Prohibited) [1].

   Once a visitor entry has been created, and the Mobile Node
   establishes a link layer channel with the Foreign Agent, its traffic
   will be immediately delivered, along with a Mobility Advertisement
   message [1]. A Mobile Node MUST issue a Registration Request when it
   receives a Mobility Advertisement from a new Foreign Agent.

   Note that Foreign Agents MAY delay in sending Mobility
   Advertisements, especially to reduce noticeable service disruption
   during a ping-pong effect. However, when doing so, the Foreign Agent
   MAY need to re-issue a new Handoff Request to oFA (and optionally the
   Regional Registration message to GFA), to extend the visitor entry's
   lifetime.

   Delaying Mobility Advertisements MAY also be done in wireless
   technologies that support dormant mobiles. When this is done, a
   Foreign Agent would typically wait to send the advertisement until
   the mobile is no longer in the dormant mode. When data is received by
   the Foreign Agent for a dormant Mobile Node, it SHOULD initiate the
   link-layer mechanism that causes the mobile to "wake-up" (this is
   typically known as paging).

   The above procedures require that Foreign Agents issue Handoff
   Requests as a result of Link-Layer triggers. However, the discovery



Calhoun et al.              expires May 2001                   [Page 16]





INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2000


   of the identity of the Foreign Agents to which the Handoff messages
   must be sent is outside the scope of this document.

   In the event that a Foreign Agent handling a particular Mobile Node's
   visitor entry is soon to expire, and the Mobile Node has not yet
   issued a Registration Request, the FA has the option to transmit a
   new Handoff Request message to the old Foreign Agent (and the
   optional Regional Registration Request to the GFA). Whether the
   renewal is performed on behalf of the Mobile Node is a policy
   decision up to the network administrator.

   A Foreign Agent MAY receive packets for a Mobile Node to which it
   does not have a direct link layer connection. At this point, the
   Foreign Agent MAY:
      1. Drop all packets for the Mobile Node
      2. Buffer packets for the Mobile Node
      3. Attempt to establish a link-layer connection with the mobile
      4. Issue a Regional Registration Request with a zero lifetime

   Given that a Mobile Node's packets will be delivered prior to
   registration, a Mobile Node is free to discard all packets received
   from Foreign Agents with which it hasn't registered.

   When the new Foreign Agent receives the Mobile Node's Registration
   Request [1], its Anchor Foreign Agent changes to the new Foreign
   Agent. The Foreign Agent MUST transmit a Handoff Request message to
   the old Foreign Agent with the lifetime field set to zero. A Foreign
   Agent that receives a Handoff Request with the lifetime field set to
   zero is being informed that it is no longer the anchor point for the
   mobile. It MAY issue a Handoff Request to the new Foreign Agent in
   the future if it wishes to keep receiving the mobile's packets for
   possible delivery.

   When a Foreign Agent determines that it is no longer servicing a
   Mobile Node, it SHOULD issue a Regional Registration Request message
   with the lifetime field set to zero (0). This will cause the visitor
   entry associated with the Foreign Agent's Care-Of address on the GFA
   to be deleted. Foreign Agents MAY decide to not issue this message
   immediately when a link-layer trigger is received, in order to
   support smooth service during a ping-pong event.


7.2  Gateway Foreign Agent Considerations

   Upon receipt of a Regional Registration Request, a GFA MUST create a
   visitor entry indicating the Mobile Node's current point of
   attachment.  In the event that a visitor entry already exists, the
   GFA SHOULD be able to create multiple visitor entries for the same



Calhoun et al.              expires May 2001                   [Page 17]





INTERNET DRAFT                                             November 2000


   Mobile Nodes with different Care-Of addresses. If the 'S' bit was
   enabled in the Regional Registration Request, the GFA MUST be able to
   forward the mobile's packets to all Foreign Agents in the visitor
   entries.

   When constructing the Regional Registration Reply, the GFA SHOULD
   include the FA-FA authentication extension [6], and set the lifetime
   field to the lesser of:
      1. number of seconds before the Mobile Node's Registration with
         its Home Agent will expire.
      2. The lifetime of the locally created Visitor Entry.

   In the event that the Regional Registration Request's lifetime field
   was set to zero (0), the GFA MUST remove the visitor entry associated
   with the Care-Of address in the message.

   Should the GFA decide that the Foreign Agent is not to provide
   service to the Mobile Node, it MUST issue a Regional Registration
   Reply message, with the code field set to DO_NOT_SERVICE_MN (see
   Section 11).


8.0  Handoff Request Message

   The Handoff Request message is used to inform a peer that a pro-
   active handoff is being initiated. The Handoff Request message can be
   used for both source and target triggers, through the Type of Trigger
   'I' bit in the message flags. When sent as a result of a target
   trigger, the Home Address and Home Agent fields MAY be set to zero
   (unless this information was communicated by the link layer, which is
   outside the scope of this document).

9.0  Handoff Reply Message

   The Handoff Reply message is sent in response to the Handoff Request
   message. When a source trigger caused the Handoff Request message to
   be sent, this message is sent with a successful code if the Visitor
   Entry was successfully created. When a target trigger caused the
   Handoff Request message, receipt of this message with a successfuly
   code SHOULD cause the Visitor Entry to be created.

      Lifetime          If the Code field indicates that the
                        registration was accepted, the Lifetime field is
                        set to the number of seconds remaining before
                        the registration is considered expired.  A value
                        of zero indicates that the mobile node has been
                        deregistered.  A value of 0xffff indicates
                        infinity.  If the Code field indicates that the
                        registration was denied, the contents of the
                        Lifetime field are unspecified and MUST be

      S                 When set, and when no GFA address extension is
                        present, it indicates that both oFA and nFA will

10.0  Generalized Link Layer Address Extension

   This section defines the  Generalized Link Layer Address (LLA)
   Extension, used by any that needs to communicate Link Layer
   Addresses. The format of the extension follows MIER [13], and each
   sub-type of link-layer address defines its own sub-structure. This
   draft defines two sub-types, the cdma2000 IMSI and the Ethernet
   Address.  Future RFCs should allocate their own sub-type and define
   their own address formats.

11.0  Error Values

   The following table contains the name of Code [9] to be returned in a

12.0  IANA Considerations

   The number for the Generalized Link Layer Address Extension in
   section 10 is taken from the numbering space defined for Mobile IP
   registration extensions defined in RFC 2002 [1]. These MUST NOT
   conflict with any numbers used in RFC 2002[1], RFC 2344 [12], RFC
   2356 [16], RFC 2794 [17] and RFC 3012 [18].

   The Code values specified for errors, listed in section 11, MUST NOT
   conflict with any other code values listed in RFC 2002 [1], RFC 2344
   [12], RFC 2356 [16], RFC 2794 [17] and RFC 3012 [18].

   Sections 8 and 9 require numbers assigned from the Mobile IP control
   message type address space. The numbers assigned MUST NOT conflict
   with [1], [6] and [7].


13.0  Security Considerations

   Similar to [6] and [7], this specification assumes that the local
   Foreign Agent, and the GFA (or AFA) inherently trust each other. This
   MAY be achieved through the use of a long lived security association.

   This specification introduces a new change to Mobile IP, which is the
   ability for a Mobile Node to receive packets from a Foreign Agent to
   which it has not yet registered. In the event that the Mobile Node
   does not wish to receive packets from unknown Foreign Agents, it MAY
   drop them.

   Although this document does not specify how Foreign Agents can

   identify, or track, Mobile Nodes, it is assumed that the wireless
   link layer be sufficiently secure in order to correctly identify a
   Mobile Node. Wireless networks that do not provide such features will
   be subjected to impersonation attacks, where malicious nodes could
   cause the Foreign Agents to believe that a Mobile Node has moved to
   other service areas.
