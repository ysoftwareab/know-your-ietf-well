Abstract

   This document proposes an algorithm for marking and metering by using
   pre-congestion notification (PCN) baseline encoding for both flow
   admission and flow termination.  The proposed algorithm uses
   threshold marking whose TBthreshold.threshold is set to the number of
   bits of a metered-packet smaller than the token bucket size.  Another
   threshold for the token bucket is required to change the marking.
   frequency.  Under the flow termination state, all the packets are to
   be threshold-marked.  Under the admission stop state, 1/Nth of
   packets are to be threshold-marked when the meter indicates.  We

1.  Introduction

   Pre-congestion notification (PCN) gives information to support
   admission control and flow termination in order to protect the
   quality of service (QoS) of inelastic flows.  Although several
   algorithms (e.g., [I-D.briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb], [I-D.charny-pcn-single-
   marking],[I-D.babiarz-pcn-3sm]) have been proposed to achieve PCN,
   only the single marking algorithm (SM) [I-D.charny-pcnsingle-
   marking] meets the requirement of baseline encoding.

   This document proposes an algorithm for marking and metering by using
   PCN baseline encoding for both flow admission and flow termination.
   Our algorithm uses PCN-threshold marking although SM uses PCN-excess-
   traffic marking.  Although our algorithm uses an elaborate mechanism,
   it chooses PCN-admissible and PCN-supportable rates independently.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document conforms to the terminology of
   [ID.ietf-pcn-architecture] and [I-D.ietf-pcn-marking-behaviour].


3.  Single Threshold-Marking

   We propose an algorithm of marking and metering by using PCN baseline
   encoding for both flow admission and flow termination.  This
   algorithm for marking uses only the PCN-threshold-rate as PCN-
   supportable rate and does not use the PCN-excess-rate.  We show a
   schematic of how the PCN admission control and flow termination
   mechanisms operate as the rate of PCN-traffic increases, for a PCN-
   domain with three type of ratios of PCN-threshold-marked packets and
   three states of Marking.ratio at Fig. 1.  As shown Fig. 1, no packets
   are PCN-marked at a rate less than the PCN-admissible-rate.  Some
   packets are PCN-marked at rates between PCNadmissible and PCN-
   supportable rates, and all the packets are PCN-marked at rates
   greater than the PCN-supportable-rate.  Single threshold-marking
   algorithm (STM) uses a PCN-threshold-rate with a very large
   TBthreshold. threshold and one-N-th packets are marked
   (Marking.frequency: 1/N) according to PCN-threshold marking with a
   very large TBthreshold.threshold to accomplish having some packets
   PCN-marked.  Marking.frequency is a ratio of actual marking to
   marking according to PCN-threshold marking.  One-N-th packets are
   regularly marked according to PCN-threshold marking with a very large
   TBthreshold.threshold.  Marking with Marking.frequency: 1/N is
   similar to N-th packet marking of [I-D. westberg-pcn-load-control].
   The marking.frequeny is applied to threshold marking although N-th
   packet marking is applied to excess traffic marking.  To achieve

   having no packets being PCN-marked under the PCN-admissible rate, the
   marking switch is turned off under the PCN-admissible rate.  To
   achieve having all the packets PCN-threshold marked, the proposed
   algorithm uses PCN-threshold marking with another TBthreshold.  This
   marking.frequency is 1, and this is the same as described in [I-D.
   pcn-marking-behaviour] when the other TBthreshold is regarded as
   TBthreshold.threshold in [I-D. pcn-marking-behaviour].  We explain it
   in detail in the following subsections.

3.1.  Operation at the PCN-interior-node

   We assume that a token bucket mechanism is used; other
   implementations are possible.  We explain how to mark by using two
   token buckets in cooperation.  The first token bucket is not used for
   marking but for a marking switch.  The second token bucket is used
   for marking.  When the marking switch is OFF, no packet is marked.
   When the switch is ON, some or all packets are marked according to
   the second token bucket.

   We explain the first token bucket in detail.  Tokens of the first
   token bucket are added at the PCN-admissible-rate.  Tokens are
   removed equal to the size in bits of the metered-packet.  These

Internet-Draft                 ST Marking                  November 2008


   additions and removals are independent of the second token bucket.
   If the metered traffic is sustained at a level greater than the PCN-
   admissible-rate, then the marking switch is set to ON.  However, a
   short burst of traffic at greater than the PCN-admissible-rate may
   not trigger the switch to go ON.  If the burst is sufficiently long
   such that the amount of tokens in the first token bucket are less
   than threshold (TB1.threshold), the marking switch is set to ON.
   Otherwise, the marking switch is OFF.  The behavior of the first
   token bucket is similar to that of Threshold-marking although there
   is a difference between actual marking and having the marking switch
   ON.  When the marking switch is ON, packets are PCN-threshold-marked
   according to the meter based on the second token bucket.  When the
   marking switch is OFF, no packet is marked regardless of the meter of
   the second token bucket.

   We explain the second token bucket in detail.  Regardless of the
   marking switch being ON or OFF, tokens of the second token bucket are
   added at the PCN threshold-rate, which is the PCN-supportable-rate
   and tokens are removed equal to the size in bits of the metered-
   packet.  These additions and removals are independent of the first
   token bucket.  The TBthreshold.threshold should be set to the number
   of bits of a metered packet smaller than the token bucket size
   although it is not an *intermediate* depth described in [I-D. ietf-
   pcn-marking-behaviour].  This is the same as the second token bucket
   size before the removal of tokens for the arrived packet.  If the
   marking switch is ON and Marking.frequency is 1, an arrived packet is
   marked.  If the marking switch is ON and Marking.frequency is 1/N,
   1/Nth of arrived packets are marked.  The Marking.frequency has two
   values: 1 and 1/N. If the amount of tokens in the second token bucket
   is not more than TB2.threshold, the Marking.frequency is 1.
   Otherwise, it is 1/N. The TB2.threshold is set at a deep depth of the
   second token bucket.  The number of N MUST be the same in the domain.
   This PCN-domain-wide constant does not impose any constraint except
   the PCN-domain-wide constant itself.

   Note that marking by metering whether the amount of token in the
   second token bucket is less than the TBthreshold.threshold or not
   gives a good approximation of utilization of a single link.  If
   packets arrive according to the Poisson process, the marking ratio is
   the utilization of a single link [Kleinrock].  Furthremore, if an
   arrival process is a superposition of renewal processes, the arrival
   process approaches the Poisson process as the number of
   superpositions approaches infinity [Cox].  Therefore, when the number
   of superpositions of renewal processes is sufficiently large, this
   metering gives a good approximation of the utilization of a single
   link.

   An arrived packet is PCN-threshold-marked per one-Nth when the

   marking switch is ON and the Marking.frequency is 1/N, that is, the
   amount of tokens of the second token buckets is less than the
   TBthreshold.threshold.  If the amount of tokens of the second token
   bucket is less than a configured intermediate depth, termed
   TB2.threshold, the Marking.frequency is changed 1/N to 1.  The
   Marking.frequency is changed from 1 to 1/N when tokens of the second
   token bucket is larger than the TB2.threshold.  This marking is
   expressed by the following pseudo code:


    Input: pcn packet
    Marking.ratio = 1/N;
    n = 0;
    FOR i = 1 to 2
    TBi.fill = min(TBi.size,TBi.fill + TBi.rate*(now - TBi.lastUpdate));
       // add tokens to the two token buckets
       TBi.fill = min(TBi.fill - packet.size, 0);
       //remove tokens from each token bucket
    ENDFOR
    IF TB1.fill <= TB1.threshold THEN  //marking switch is ON
        IF  TB2.fill < TB2threshold.threshold THEN
            IF TB2.fill > TB2.threshold THEN
                markCnt++;
                IF mod(markCnt, N) == 0 THEN //Marking.frequency = 1/N
                   markCnt = 0;
                   packet.mark = TM;

   according to Supportable rate.

3.2.  Operation at the PCN-egress-node

   A PCN-egress-node measures the ratio of PCN-threshold-marked packets
   on a per-ingress basis, and reports to the PCN-ingress-node one
   value.  The value is the Congestion Level Estimate (CLE), which is
   the fraction of the marked traffic received from the ingress node and
   is exactly the same as that of CL, SM, and three state PCN marking
   algorithm(3sM).

   Furthremore, PCN-egress-node measures L-sequential marked packets per
   PCN-ingress-node.  When the PCN-egress-node receives those packets
   from a PCN-ingress-node, it starts measuring the receiving rate of
   this PCN-ingressnode.  L-sequential marked packets received during
   the measurement interval are ignored.  The PCN-egress-node sends a
   packet of information about the receiving rate to the PCN-ingress-
   node after the measurement interval.  After that, the PCN-egress-node
   again starts measuring the receiving rate if it receives L-sequential
   marked packets.

3.3.  Operation at the PCN-ingress-node

3.3.1.  Admission Decision

   Just as in CL and SM, the admission decision is based on the CLE.
   The ingress node stops admission of new flows if the CLE is greater
   than a predefined threshold (CLE threshold).  The CLE threshold is
   chosen under the following maximum value.  The maximum of the CLE
   threshold MUST be

              CLE threshold = (1/N)*rho  ,                 (1)


   where rho represents the minimum ratio between the PCN-admissible-
   rate and PCN-supportable-rate via all the links between PCN-ingress
   and egress nodes and N is the denominator of marking.frequency 1/N.
   Note that the marking ratio approaches to the maximum CLE threshold
   described above when the load is PCN-admissible-rate at a bottleneck
   link via all the links between PCN-ingress and egress nodes as the
   number of superpositions of flows approaches infinity, as described
   in Sect 3.1.

3.3.2.  Flow Termination Decision

   When a PCN-ingress-node receives a packet with information about a
   receiving rate from a PCN-egress-node, it starts measuring a sending
   rate for this PCN-egress-node immediately.  If the PCN-ingress-node
   receives a new receiving rate from the same PCN-egress-node during
   measurement interval, the new rate is ignored.  At the end of the

   measurement interval, the PCNingress- node terminates flows whose
   bandwidth is the same as the sending rate - (1-y)* receiving rate.
   The value of y is small enough to tolerate over termination.

   This termination spends more time when the PCN-supportable rate is
   much less than the physical rate because the sending rate is almost
   the same as the receiving rate even under a congested situation.


4.  Impact on PCN marking behaviour

   The goal of this section is to propose several minor changes to the
   PCNmarking- behaviour framework as currently described in [I-D.ietf-
   pcn-marking-behaviour] in order to enable the Single Threshold
   marking approach.  Threshold marking in this draft conforms to
   [I-D.pcn-marking-behaviour] except for "intermediate depth".  We
   propose an addition of two marking parameters: Marking.frequency,
   which is a ratio between actual marking and marking according to PCN-
   threshold marking.

6.1.  Network and Signaling Models

   We used three types of network topologies shown in the Figures below
   for simulations.  They are the same as those in [I-D.charny-pcn-
   single-marking] and the first two figures are the same as those in
   [I-D. briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb].  The first type of network topology is
   Single Link, as shown in Fig. A.1.  The second type is a multi-link
   network with a single bottleneck (termed "RTT"), as shown in Fig.A.2.
   The third type is a range of multi-bottleneck topologies shown in
   Fig.A.3 (termed "Parking Lot").

   A single link between an ingress and an egress node is shown in
   Fig.A.1, where all floes enter at node A and depart from node B. This
   topology is used for the basic verification of the behavior of the
   algorithms with respect to a single IEA in isolation.

   As shown in Fig. A.2, a set of ingresses (A;B;C) are connected to an
   interior node in the network (D).  This topology is used to study the
   behavior of the algorithm where many IEAs share a single bottleneck
   link.  The number of ingresses varied in different simulation
   experiments in the range of 10-1000.  All links generally have
   different propagation delays.  So this propagation delays were chosen
   randomly in the range of 1ms - 100 ms (although in some experiments
   all propagation delays are set the same).  This node D in turn is
   connected to the egress (F).  In this topology, different sets of
   flows between each ingress and the egress converge on a single link
   D-F, where the PCN algorithm is enabled.  The capacities of the
   ingress links are not limiting, and hence, no PCN is enabled on
   those.  The bottleneck link D-F is modeled with a 10ms propagation
   delay in all simulations.  Therefore, the range of round-trip delays
   in the experiments is from 40ms to 220ms.

   Another type of network of interest is parking lot (PLT) topology,
   which has multi-bottleneck links.  The simplest PLT with 2
   bottlenecks is illustrated in Fig A.3(a).  A traffic matrix with this
   network on this topology is as follows:

   o  an aggregate of "2-hop" flows entering the network at A and
      leaving at C (via the two links A-B-C)

   o  an aggregate of "1-hop" flows entering the network at D and
      leaving at E (via A-B)

   o  an aggregate of "1-hop" flows entering the network at E and
      leaving at F (via B-C).

   In the 2-hop PLT shown in Fig. A.3 (a) the points of congestion are
   links A-B and B-C.  The capacity of all other links is not-limited.
   We also experiment with larger PLT topologies with 3 bottlenecks (see
   Fig A.3(b)) and 5 bottlenecks (Fig A.3 (c)).  In all cases, we
   simulated one ingress-egress pair that carries the aggregate of
   "long" flows traversing all N bottlenecks (where N is the number of
   bottleneck links in the PLT topology), and N ingress-egress pairs
   that carry flows traversing a single bottleneck link and exiting at
   the next "hop".  In all cases, only the "horizontal" links in Fig.
   A.3 were the bottlenecks, with non-limiting capacities of all
   "vertical" links.  Propagation delays for all links in all PLT
   topologies are set to 1 ms.

   Our simulations concentrated primarily on the range of capacities of
   "bottleneck" links with sufficient aggregation - above 128 Mbps for
   voice and 2.4Gbps Mbps for SVD.  It should generally be expected that
   the higher link speeds will result in higher levels of aggregation,
   and hence generally better performance of the measurement-based
   algorithms.  Therefore it seems reasonable to believe that the
   studied link speeds do provide meaningful evaluation targets.

   In the simulation model, a call request arrives at the ingress and
   immediately sends a message to the egress.  The message arrives at
   the egress after the propagation time plus link processing time (but
   no queuing delay).  When the egress receives this message, it
   immediately responds to the ingress with the current CLE.  If the CLE
   is below the specified CLE-threshold, the call is admitted, otherwise
   it is rejected.  An admitted call sends packets according to one of
   the chosen traffic models for the duration of the call (see next
   section).  Propagation delay from source to the ingress and from
   destination to the egress is assumed to be negligible and is not
   modeled.

   Admissible and Supportable rates are half link speed and 90% of link
   speed, respectively, in all the links.  Actual queue size is 80,000
   packets, which is not the byte size because queue size is set by only
   packet in NS2 simulator.

6.2.  Traffic Models

   We use the same types of traffic as those of [I-D. briscoe-tsvwg-cl-
   phb], [I-D. charny-pcn-single-marking].  These are CBR voice, on-off

   traffic approximating voice with silence compression (we termed
   "VBR"), and on-off traffic with higher peak and mean rates (we termed
   the latter "Synthetic Video" (SVD).  On-off traffic (VBR and SVD) is
   described with two state Markov chain and on and off periods were
   exponentially distributed with the specified mean.

   Each flow arrives according to the Poisson process and the
   distribution of flow duration was chosen to be exponentially
   distributed with a mean of 1 min, regardless of the traffic type,
   which is the same as that in [I-D. briscoe-tsvwg-cl-phb] and [I-D.
   charny-pcn-single-marking].

   Traffic parameters for each type are summarized below:

   CBR voice

   o  Packet length: 160 bytes

   o  Packet inter-arraival time: 20ms ((160*8)/(64*1000)sec)

   o  Average rate: 64Kbps

   On-off traffic approximating voice with silence compression

   o  Packet length: 160 bytes

   o  Packet inter-arrival time during On period: 20ms

   o  Long-term average rate: 21.76 Kbps

   o  On period mean duration: 340ms; during the on period traffic is
      sent with CBR voice parameters described above

   o  Off period mean duration 660ms; no traffic is sent for the
      duration of the off period

   SVD

   o  Packet length: 1500 bytes

   o  Packet inter-arrival time during On period: 1ms

   o  Long term average rate: 4 Mbps

   o  On period mean duration: 340 ms

   o  Off period mean duration: 660 ms

6.3.  Performance Metrics

   In all our experiments, we use the percent deviation of the mean rate
   achieved in the experiment from the expected load level as
   performance metric.  We term these "over-admission" and "over-
   termination" percentages, depending on the type of the experiment.

   In our experiments of admission control, we compare the actual
   achieved average throughput to the desired traffic load (admissible
   rate) and measure the standard deviation of throughput at 500 ms
   intervals to the desired traffic load.  The desired traffic load is
   not admissible rate exactly because a signal packet for a new flow is
   sent for admission.  Therefore, the desired traffic load is the
   amount of the signal packets including not admitted flows less than
   admissible rate.

6.4.  Parameter setting for STM

   All the simulations were run with the following values:

   o  TB1.size = 20 ms at Admissible rate,

   o  TB1.threshold = 10ms at Admissible rate,

   o  TB2.size = 10ms at Supportable rate,

   o  TB2.threshold = 8ms at Supportable rate,

   o  Marking.frequency =1/3 and 1

   o  CLE threshold = 0.05 (less than Marking.frequency times ratio
      between admissible and supportable rates)

   o  CLEweight = 0.0005

   o  The number of sequential marked packets for termination = 100

   o  Extra percentage of receiving rate more than the difference
      between sending and receiving rates for termination at one time =
      5.0

   o  Interval for measureing sending rate or receiving rate = 100ms.

6.5.  Parameter setting for CL

   All the simulations were run with 5ms at Supportable rate as token
   bucket size for Termination and the following Virtual Queue
   thresholds:



Satoh, et al.             Expires May 22, 2009                 [Page 12]

Internet-Draft                 ST Marking                  November 2008


   o  min-marking-threshold: 5ms at link speed,

   o  max-marking-threshold: 15ms at link speed,

   o  virtual-queue-upper-limit: 20ms at link speed.

   The virtual-queue-upper-limit puts an upper bound on how much the
   virtual queue can grow.  In Admission control simulation, CLE and CLE
   weight are chosen as 0.05 and 0.3 respectively.

6.6.  Simulation Environment

   We used NS2 for our simulation experiments.  Simulations were run on
   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (64bit), Dell Power Edge 1950, Intel Quad-
   core Xeon 2.66GHz, 32GB RAM.


7.  Appendix B: Admission Control Simulation

7.1.  Parameter setting for admission control

   We evaluate over-admission percentages when the load of the
   bottleneck is five times of the Admissible rate, that is, 2.5 times
   of the link speed.  The simulation time is 300 sec and simulation
   results during time interval between 200 sec and 300sec are used for
   performance metric to obtain the results in the steady state.

   Egress measurement parameters for STM : In our simulations, the CLE
   is computed as an exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) with a
   weight of 0.0005.  The CLE is computed on a per-packet basis.

   Egress measurement parameters for CL : In our simulations, the
   CLEthreshold was chosen as 0.05.  The CLE is computed as an
   exponential weighted moving average (EWMA) with a weight of 0.3.  The
   CLE is computed on a per-packet basis.  These values are the same as
   those in Sect. 8.2.3 in [I-D.charny-pcn-single-marking].

7.2.  Basic evaluation

   Over-admission percentage statistics are evaluated using the Single
   Link topology.  Table B.1 gives results of an admission control
   simulation when the load is the five times the Admissible rate.  When
   the traffic type is CBR, the link speed is 128Mbps and the load is
   the rate of 5000 flows.  The call interval per Ingress-Egress
   Aggregate(IEA) is 0.012sec.  When the traffic type is VBR, the link
   speed is 78.3Mbps and the load is the rate of 9000 flows.  The call
   interval per Ingress-Egress Aggregate(IEA) is 0.0067sec.  When the
   traffic type is SVD, the link speed is 2.45Gbps and the load is the

   rate of 1500 flows.  The call interval per Ingress-Egress
   Aggregate(IEA) is 0.04sec.  We show the average of results of five
   simulations with different random seeds each traffic type.  The
   performance of STM is very good although it is inferior to that of
   CL.  We repeated this simulation by using different random seeds.

7.3.  Effect of Ingress-Egress Aggregation

   We evaluated the effect of Ingress-Egress Aggregation using RTT
   topology.  As simulations in [I-D. charny-pcn-single-marking], the
   aggregate load on the bottleneck is the same across each traffic type
   with the aggregate load being evenly divided among all ingresses.

   Table B.2 shows simulation results with traffic load condition when
   the traffic type is CBR.  In this case, link speed of the bottleneck
   is 128Mbps for all the case of number of ingresses.

   In [I-D.charny-pcn-single-marking], the fairness is illustrated using

   short-haul aggregates.  We used CBR traffic with the load of each
   bottleneck is five times of the Admissible rate.  Table B.7
   summarizes the fairness results at different topologies.  We measure
   ratios of average throughput of short-haul aggregates to that of
   long-haul aggregates during the simulation time at the first
   bottleneck.  We display the average of the five simulations.  The
   same link speed and call interval conditions in Table B.5 are used in

8.  Appendix C: Flow termination

   We evaluate over-termination percentages when the load of the
   bottleneck is 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0 times of link speed.  The load was
   lower than the Admissible rate at the beginning of the simulation.
   The simulation time is 100 sec.  The load was changed at half the
   simulation time, that is 50sec.  Simulation results during time
   interval between 70 sec and 100sec are used for performance metric to
   obtain the results in the steady state.  The rate of one IE-pair was
   changed from 0 to the load of 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0 times of link speed at
   bottleneck links with no admission control within 2.0 sec.  This
   simulated changing of a route when there was a failure.  When a
   failure happened, a new Ingree-Egress pair was generated.  Their
   traffic was regarded as traffic added by changing of a route.  The
   flows of the new Ingress-Egress pair were generated according to the
   Poisson process whose rate was the value of the generated flows
   divided by 2 sec.  The flow generation stopped at the generated flows
   whose bandwidth is the same as the load.  The duration time of all
   the flows is infinity.

8.1.  Basic evaluation

   Over termination percentages are evaluated with the Single Link
   topology.  Table C.1 gives results of a termination control
   simulation when the load is the 1.0, 1.5 and 3.0 times Link speed.
   When the traffic type is CBR, the link speed is 40.5Mbps and the load
   is the rate of 633, 950, and 1900 flows.  When the traffic type is
   VBR, the link speed is 41.1Mbps and the load is the rate of 1886,
   2830, and 5660 flows.  When the traffic type is SVD, the link speed
   is 613Mbps and the load is the rate of 153, 230, and 460 flows.  We
   show the average of results of five simulations with different random
   seeds each traffic type.

9.  Appendix D: Another Flow Termination Control

   When PCN-supportable rate is much less than the Physical rate, the
   flow termination control described in Sect.?? takes much time to
   control.  We describe another flow termination control.  A PCN-
   ingress node measures sending rate per PCN-egress nodes all the time.
   If a PCN-egress node receives L-sequential marked packets, it sends a
   message of termination to the PCNingress node.  When the PCN-ingress
   node receives the message, it terminates flows according to x-% of
   sending rate.  PCN-ingress node ignore the message during a time
   interval after termination.  The value of x is small and the time
   interval is short.
