Internet-Draft  P2PRG CORE Subgroup Problem Statement      January 2006 
    

Abstract 

   New research in the design of peer-to-peer overlay networks offers 
   the possibility of addressing limitations of existing service, 
   resource and content discovery methods.  We identify the research 
   goals to be pursued in investigating new designs for global scale 
   service discovery. The purpose of this document is to attract 
   participation from other researchers interested in these problems and 
   to lead to a coordinated research approach within the P2PRG CORE 
   subgroup.

1. Content, Resource and Service Discovery 

   Discovery of content, resources and services are fundamental 
   operations for peers in a peer-to-peer network. Many discovery 
   mechanisms have been proposed. However existing designs have 
   limitations in one or more areas of scalability, security, 
   interoperability, or generality. The purpose of this subgroup to 
   evaluate existing research, identify requirements, and develop 
   solutions for peer-to-peer content, resource, and service discovery 
   in wide-area networks. While content, resource, and service discovery

   have been conventionally addressed by separate mechanisms, we are 
   interested in identifying unified mechanisms where possible. As a 
   minimum we are interested in global-scale service discovery. 
   Existing methods for service discovery include client-server 
   mechansisms (such as SLP [RFC2608][RFC2609]), mechanisms integrated 
   into device network adapters (such as Bluetooth SDP 
   [BLU2001][BLU2004] and Salutation [SAL1996]), mechanisms integrated 
   in middleware platforms (such as Web services [W3C2004A] [W3C2004B] 
   [W3C2004C], Jini [JINI2003A][JINI2003B], and JXTA [TRA2004]), and 
   home network oriented solutions (UPnP SSDP [UPNP2000]).  
   In addition there are experimental systems for service discovery such 
   as SSDS [CZE1999] and these extensions to SLP: WASRV [ROS1997], wide-
   area SLP [HUA2000], and mesh-enhanced SLP [RFC3528][ZHA2000]; and the 
   use of wide-area multicast to advertise and discover services 
   [MIC2004].  
   Further there are various peer-to-peer overlay networks and proposed 
   designs, both unstructured and structured by which large numbers of 
   peers share content and services. Typically large-scale unstructured 
   peer-to-peer systems use limited scope flooding or random walk to 
   reach other peers with requests, whereas structured peer-to-peer 
   systems use a distributed hash table (DHT) to store key-value peers. 
   The integration of peer-to-peer overlay networks with service 
   definition and lookup has emerged as "service overlay" [GU2004].  An 
   example of mapping service definitions to a structured multi-hop 
   overlay is INS/Twine [BAL2002].  An example of using peer-to-peer 
   overlay for web services lookup is [SCH2004].  A related proposal is 
   [BRA2004]. 
   Associated with various discovery mechanisms are related mechanisms 
   for service/resource advertisement, description, and invocation.  
   More extensive surveys of existing methods of service discovery 
   protocols include [BET2000][LEE2002][ZHU2002] and [TRA2004]. 

2. Definitions 

   Group: a collection of peers or groups of peers satisfying some 
   membership constraint 
   Search: a discovery mechanism in which content or resources stored in 
   a peer-to-peer network can be searched using various methods 
   including text search, keyword search, content-based retrieval or 
   meta-data search 
   Service: a computational function packaged for use by other nodes in 
   a networked environment

Internet-Draft  P2PRG CORE Subgroup Problem Statement      January 2006 
    

   Service description:  Information about a networked service such as 
   type of service, name of service, attributes of service, location of 
   service, invocation of service.  May be stored in a document or at a 
   service repository or at the node offering the service; may be 
   broadcast or multicast by the node offering the service.  May be 
   machine readable or human readable or both. 
   Service advertisement: the publication of a service description, in 
   whole or part, by or on behalf of the service offerer, for access by 
   other nodes 
   Service composition: the definition of a new service using two or 
   more existing services 
   Service discovery: retrieval or access of a service description by 
   nodes other than the service offerer, including browsing, search by 
   name, class, type and or service attributes 
   Service invocation: remote execution of a service over a computer 
   network 
   Service notification: an event signaling change in the availability 
   or state of a service 
   Service overlay: the use of an overlay network to store and lookup 
   service descriptions 

3. Problem Statement 

3.1. Global-Scale Service Discovery 

   A global-scale service discovery mechanism should provide the 
   following capabilities: 
   o  Internet-wide service advertisement and discovery of services, 
      such that any service on the Internet can be discovered by any 
      peer on the Internet.  The expected volume of transactions 
      expected in a global service discovery mechanism is in the range 
      of DNS lookup volume. 

   o  Ability to index service descriptions by geographic location and 
      domain in which the services are available 

   o  Ability to index service descriptions by arbitrary meta data 
      regarding the service 

   o  Support for creating and using composite services from services 
      offered by different peers 


 
 
Buford                  Expires July 13, 2006                  [Page 4] 

Internet-Draft  P2PRG CORE Subgroup Problem Statement      January 2006 
    

   o  Use of multiple service description formats which might be 
      tailored by application or level of semantic description 

   o  Access to services, service descriptions, and service 
      advertisements dependent on authorization rights 

   o  Access to services, service descriptions, and service 
      advertisements by peer group membership 

   o  Individual domains can administer the service availability, 
      security, and service descriptions 

   In addition it is desirable that: 
   o  The mechanism can be used in isolation by peers in PANs, ad hoc 
      networks, or other limited networking environments 

   o  Collections of peers can join and separate from other collections 
      of peers without interruption a service discovery capability 
      within the respective collections 

   o  The mechanism is compatible with existing service discovery 
      mechanisms, possibly through gateways 

3.2. Service-Oriented Overlays 

   o  The mechanism is open with respect to the overlay network, and 
      should work with multiple distinct overlay networks 

   o  Different overlays supporting service discovery will vary by 
      architecture, security, and performance characteristics 

3.3. Internet Infrastructure 

   o  The mechanism may be used for portions Internet infrastructure 
      services such as DNS [COX2002]. 

   o  The mechanism does not require changing existing Internet 
      infrastructure 

3.4. Content and Resource Discovery / Search 

   o  The mechanism for service discovery may be useful for content and 
      resource discovery, and a unified design is desirable 

   o  Indexing, mapping, and lookup for specific discovery types in the 
      overlay may vary
