1.  Introduction

   The Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) [RFC8520] defines a YANG
   data model to express what sort of access a device requires to
   operate correctly.  That document additionally defines three ways for
   the device to communicate the URL of the resulting JSON [RFC8259]
   format file to a network enforcement point: DHCP, within an X.509
   certificate extension, and via LLDP.

Internet-Draft                   QR-MUD                    November 2021


   Each of the above mechanism conveys the MUD URL in-band, and requires
   modifications to the device firmware.  Most small IoT devices do not
   have LLDP, and often have very restricted DHCP clients.  Adding the
   LLDP or DHCP options requires at least some minimal configuration
   change, and possibly entire new subsystems.  Meanwhile, use of the
   PKIX certification extension only makes sense as part of a larger
   IDevID based [ieee802-1AR] deployment such as
   [I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra].

   In the above cases these mechanisms can only be implemented by
   persons with access to modify and update the firmware of the device.

   In the meantime there is a chicken or egg problem ([chickenegg]): no
   manufacturers include MUD URLs in their products as there are no
   gateways that use them.  No gateways include code that processes MUD
   URLs as no products produce them.

   The protocol described here allows any person with physical access to
   the device to affix a reference to a MUD URL that can later be
   scanned by an end user.

   Such an action can be done by

   *  the marketing department of the Manufacturer,

   *  an outsourced assembler plant,

   *  value added resellers (perhaps in response to a local RFP),

   *  a company importing the product (possibly to comply with a local
      regulation),

   *  a network administrator (perhaps before sending devices home with
      employees, or to remote sites),

   *  a retailer as a value added service.

   QRcodes are informally described in [qrcode] and formally defined in
   [isoiec18004].  The protocol described in this document uses a QRcode
   to encode the MUD URL.  Specifically, the protocol leverages the data
   format from the Reverse Logistics Association's Standardized Quick
   Response for Logistics [SQRL].

Internet-Draft                   QR-MUD                    November 2021


   SQRL codes are being put on devices via sticker or via laser etching
   into the case in order to deal with many situations, but specifically
   for end-of-life processing for the device.  An important idea behind
   the effort is that clearly identifying a product permits appropriate
   disposal, refurbishment or recycling of the components of the
   product.

   There are also use cases for SQRL described in which the codes are
   used as part of regular maintenance for a product.

   SQRL is an application of the 12N Data Identifier system specified by
   the ANSI MH10.8.2 Committee [mh10] in a format appropriate for
   QRcodes as well as other things like NFCs transmissions.

   QRcode generators are available as web services [qrcodewebservice],
   or as programs such as [qrencode].

   Section 4 summarizes the considerations contained in
   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud-acceptable-urls] section 6.1 ("Updating MUD URLs
   vs Updating MUD files").  Due to the immutable nature of the QRcode,
   MUD URLs in this document will need to non-firmware specific.

2.  Terminology

   Although this document is not an IETF Standards Track publication, it
   adopts the conventions for normative language to provide clarity of
   instructions to the implementer.  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT",
   "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
   "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

3.  Protocol

   This QRcode protocol builds upon the work by [SQRL].  That protocol
   is very briefly described in the next section.  Then the list of
   needed Data Records to be filled in is explained.

Internet-Draft                   QR-MUD                    November 2021


3.1.  The SQRL Protocol

   [SQRL] documents an octet protocol that can be efficiently encoded
   into QRcodes using a sequence of ASCII bytes, plus six control codes
   (see section 3.1 of [SQRL]):

   *  <RS> Record Separator (ASCII 30)

   *  <EoT> End of Transmission (ASCII 4)

   *  <FS> Field Separator (ASCII 28)

   *  <GS> Group Separator (ASCII 29)

   *  <US> Unit Separator (ASCII 31),

   *  Concatenation Operator (ASCII 43: "+").

   Section 7.2 of [SQRL] gives the details, which can be summarized as:

   1.  The QR code header starts with:

   "[)>" <RS> "06" <GS> "12N"

   1.  Include one or more Data Records.  This consists of a four letter
       Field Identifiers followed by ASCII characters terminated with a
       <Unit Separator>.

   2.  End with:

   <RS><EoT>

   There are additionally optional flags that may be present in every
   Data Record as described in section 7.4 of [SQRL].  These flags have
   no bearing on MUD processing.  A parser which is only collecting MUD
   URLs will not need to parse those flags.  A general purpose SQRL
   parser will need more complexity.

   Field Seperator characters are used in SQRL to signify the beginning
   of a new unit of data.  A MUD specific parser that encounters a Field
   Seperator and has not yet collected the right MUD information MUST
   ignore the characters collected so far and then restart.

   Environment records, as described in [SQRL] section 7.4, look and act
   exactly as fields, with a special Field Identifier.  They serve no
   purpose when looking for MUD information, and MAY be ignored.

3.2.  Manufacturer Usage Descriptions in SQRL

3.2.1.  B000 Company Name

   The B000 Data Record is mandatory in [SQRL].  It MUST be in ASCII
   representation.  It should be a representation of the company or
   brand name.  It SHOULD match the ietf-mud/mud/mfg-name in the MUD
   file, however the MUD file can contain arbitrary UTF8 for this name,
   while the SQRL files are expected to be 7-bit US-ASCII.

3.2.2.  B001 Product Name

   The B001 Data Record is optional in [SQRL].  It's presence is
   RECOMMENDED.  Some third parties that create QRcode stickers might
   not know the product name with 100% certainty, and MAY prefer to omit
   this rather than create further confusion.  It is the Product Name in
   ASCII.

3.2.3.  B002 Model Number

   The B002 Data Record is optional in [SQRL], but is MANDATORY in this
   profile.  It is the Model Name in ASCII.  It SHOULD match the
   optional ietf-mud/mud/model-name in the MUD file if that entry is
   present in the MUD file.

   If a third party that is creating QRcodes can not locate an official
   model number when creating their MUD file and QRcode, then the third
   party SHOULD make one up.

3.2.4.  MUD URL Data Record

   A new Field Identifier has been assigned by the Reverse Logistics
   Association (RLA), which is "M180" This record MUST be filled with
   the MUD URL.

   Short URLs are easier to encode into QRcode because they require
   fewer pixels of QRcode.  More content in the QRcode requires a bigger
   image.

   Use of URL shortening services (see [URLshorten]) can be useful
   provided that the service is stable throughout the lifetime of the
   device and QRcode, and that the privacy stance of the service is well
   understood.

   Section 8.1 of [SQRL] also has some good advice on longevity concerns
   with URLs.

Internet-Draft                   QR-MUD                    November 2021


   The URL provided MUST NOT have a query (?) portion present.  If one
   is present, the query portion MUST be removed before processing.

3.2.5.  MUD Device MAC Address

   In order for the MUD controller to associate the above policy with a
   specific device, some unique identifier must be provided to the MUD
   controller.  The most actionable identifier is the Ethernet MAC
   address.  [SQRL] section 9.10 defines the Data Record: "M06C" as the
   MAC address.  No format for the MAC address is provided in that
   document.

   This document RECOMMENDS 12 (or 16) hex octets are used with no
   spaces or punctuation. (16 octets are used in the IEEE OUI-64 format
   used in 802.15.4, and some next generation Ethernet proposals)

   Parsers that find punctuation (such as colons (":"), dashes ("-"), or
   white space) MUST skip over it.

4.  Generic URL or Version Specific URL

   MUD URLs which are communicated in-band by the device, and which are
   programmed into the device's firmware may provide a firmware specific
   version of the MUD URL.  This has the advantage that the resulting
   Access Control Lists (ACLs) implemented are specific to the needs of
   that version of the firmware.

   A MUD URL which is affixed to the device with a sticker, or etched
   into the case can not be changed.

   Given the considerations of [I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud-acceptable-urls]
   section 6.1 ("Updating MUD URLs vs Updating MUD files"), it is
   prudent to use a MUD URL which points to a MUD file which will only
   have new features added over time, and never have features removed.

   When the firmware eventually receives built-in MUD URL support, then
   a more specific URL may be used.

   Note that in many cases it will be third parties who are generating
   these QRcodes, so the MUD file may be hosted by the third party.

5.  Crowd Supply of MUD Files

   At the time of writing, the IETF MUD is a new IETF Proposed Standard.
   Hence, IoT device manufacturers have not yet provided MUD profiles
   for their devices.  A research group at the University of New South
   Wales (UNSW Sydney) has developed an open-source tool, called MUDgee
   ([MUDgee]), which automatically generates a MUD file (profile) for an
   IoT device from its traffic trace in order to make this process
   faster, easier, and more accurate.  Note that the generated profile
   completeness solely depends on the completeness of the input traffic
   traces.  MUDgee assumes that all the activity seen is intended and
   benign.

   UNSW researchers have applied MUDgee about 30 consumer IoT devices
   from their lab testbed, and publicly released their MUD files
   ([MUDfiles]).  MUDgee can assist IoT manufacturers in developing and
   verifying MUD profiles, while also helping adopters of these devices
   to ensure they are compatible with their organisational policies.

   Similar processes have been done in a number of other public and
   private labs.  One of the strong motivations for this specification
   is to allow for this work to leave the lab, to be applied in the
   field.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   The presence of the MUD URL in the QR code reveals the manufacturer
   of the device, the type or model of the device, and possibly the
   firmware version of the device.

   The MAC address of the device will also need to be present, and this
   is potentially Personally Identifiable Information (PII).  Such
   QRcodes should not be placed on the outside of the packaging, and
   only on the device itself, ideally on a non-prominent part of the
   device. (e.g., the bottom).

   The QR code sticker should not placed on any part of the device that
   might become visible to machine vision systems in the same area.
   This includes security systems, robotic vacuum cleaners, anyone
   taking a picture with a camera.  Such systems may store the
   picture(s) in such a way that a future viewer of the image will be
   able to decode the QR code, possibly through assembly of multiple
   pictures.  Of course, the QR code is not, however, a certain
   indicator that the device is present, only that the QR code sticker
   that came with the device is present.

Internet-Draft                   QR-MUD                    November 2021


7.  Security Considerations

   The mere presence of at QRcode on a device does not in itself create
   any security issues on its own.  Neither an attached paper sticker or
   a laser etched code in a plastic case will not affect the device
   operation.  The QRcode is not active, it is not in general able to
   communicate on nearby networks.  It is conceivable that something
   more active is concealed in the sticker: an NFC or RFID tag for
   instance.  But, any sticker could contain such a thing: on some
   university campuses stickers are often used as part of political
   campaigns, and can be found attached all over the place.

   Security issues that this protocol create are related to assumptions
   that the presence of the QRcode might imply.  The presence of the
   QRcode may imply to some owners or network operators that the
   behaviour of the device has been vetted by some authority.  It is
   here that some caution is required.

   The network operator who takes the MUD file designated by the QRcode
   needs to be careful that they are validating the signature on the MUD
   file.  Not only that the file is intact, but that the signer of the
   file is authorized to sign MUD files for that vendor, or that the
   network operator has some trust if the MUD file is a crowd sourced
   definition.  At the time of writing, [RFC8520] does not define any
   infrastructure to authenticate or authorize MUD file signers.

   A possibly bigger risk from application of MUD file stickers to
   devices is that they may begin to convey a sense of safety to users
   of the device.  The presence of the sticker, possibly with the logo
   of the physical establishment in which the device is located could
   convey to occupants of the establishment that this device is an
   official device.  For instance, a university which only deploys
   sensors on the university campus that have been vetted for compliance
   against a MUD definition.

   The risk is then of social engineering: any device with a reasonable
   looking QRcode may become a trusted device.  An attacker that wishes
   to infiltrate their own devices need only suitably camoflage the
   device with an appropriate sticker in order to convey legitimacy.

   Another issue with the stickers is that the wrong sticker could be
   applied to a device by a reseller or other trusted party, either in
   error, or via some physical or socially engineered attack against
   that party.  The network operator now onboards a device, and applies
   what they think is a legitimate network policy for the device in
   their hands, only it is in fact a policy for another kind of device.

   Inclusion of the device specific MAC address (described in
   Section 3.2.5) in the QRcode makes use of the MUD code much easier as
   it identifies the device specifically.  If the MAC addresss is not
   included, then a network operator, having the device in their hands,
   then has to associate the policy with the device through some other
   interface.

   Despite the significant advantage of having the MAC address include,
   it is unlikely that third party stickers will include that.
   Including the MAC address requires that the QRcode for that device
   requires that a unique sticker be created for each device.  This is
   possible if the sticker is applied by a manufacturer: it is already
   common to have a serial number and MAC address on the outside of the
   device.  In that case, if the QRcode is part of that sticker, then
   the customization problem is not that complex.

   For cases where a third party has produced the QRcode, it is likely
   that every device of a particular model will have the same QRcode
   applied, omitting the MAC address.  This makes it more likely that a
   policy will be applied to the wrong device.
