1.  Introduction

   It can be troublesome for an operator to correlate a BGP-4 [RFC4271]
   session teardown in the network with a notice that was transmitted
   via off-line methods such email or telephone calls.  This document
   updates [RFC4486] by specifying a mechanism to transmit a short
   freeform UTF-8 [RFC3629] message as part of a Cease NOTIFICATION
   message [RFC4271] to inform the peer why the BGP session is being
   shutdown or reset.

2.  Shutdown Communication

   If a BGP speaker decides to terminate its session with a BGP
   neighbor, and it sends a NOTIFICATION message with the Error Code
   "Cease" and Error Subcode "Administrative Shutdown" or
   "Administrative Reset" [RFC4486], it MAY include an UTF-8 encoded
   string.  The contents of the string are at the operator's discretion.

   The Cease NOTIFICATION message with a Shutdown Communication is
   encoded as below:

                                 Figure 1

   Subcode:  the Error Subcode value MUST be one of the following
      values: 2 ("Administrative Shutdown") or 4 ("Administrative
      Reset").

   Length:  this 8-bit field represents the length of the Shutdown
      Communication field in octets.  The length value MUST range from 0
      to 128 inclusive.  When the length value is zero, no Shutdown
      Communication field follows.

   Shutdown Communication:  to support international characters, the
      Shutdown Communication field MUST be encoded using UTF-8.  A
      receiving BGP speaker MUST NOT interpret invalid UTF-8 sequences.
      Note that when the Shutdown Communication contains multibyte
      characters, the number of characters will be less than the length
      value.  This field is not NUL terminated.

   Mechanisms concerning the reporting of information contained in the
   Shutdown Communication are implementation specific but SHOULD include
   methods such as SYSLOG [RFC5424].

3.  Operational Considerations

   Operators are encouraged to use the Shutdown Communication to inform
   their peers of the reason for the shutdown of the BGP session and
   include out-of-band reference materials.  An example of a useful
   Shutdown Communication would be:

   "[TICKET-1-1438367390] software upgrade, back in 2 hours"

   "[TICKET-1-1438367390]" is a ticket reference with significance to
   both the sender and receiver, followed by a brief human readable
   message regarding the reason for the BGP session shutdown followed by
   an indication about the length of the maintenance.  The receiver can
   now use the string 'TICKET-1-1438367390' to search in their email
   archive to find more details.

4.  Error Handling

   If a Shutdown Communication with an invalid Length value, or an
   invalid UTF-8 sequence is received, a message indicating this event
   SHOULD be logged for the attention of the operator.  An erroneous or
   malformed Shutdown Communication itself MAY be logged in a hexdump
   format.

5.  IANA Considerations

   Per this document, IANA is requested to reference this document at
   subcode "Administrative Shutdown", and at subcode "Administrative
   Reset" in the "Cease NOTIFICATION message subcodes" registry under
   the "Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Parameters" group in addition to
   [RFC4486].

6.  Security Considerations

   This document uses UTF-8 encoding for the Shutdown Communication.
   There are a number of security issues with UNICODE.  Implementers and
   operator are advised to review UNICODE TR36 [UTR36] to learn about
   these issues.  UTF-8 "Shortest Form" encoding is REQUIRED to guard
   against the technical issues outlined in UTR36.

   As BGP Shutdown Communications are likely to appear in syslog output,
   there is a risk that carefully constructed Shutdown Communication
   might be formatted by receiving systems in a way to make them appear
   as additional syslog messages.  To limit the ability to mount such an
   attack, the BGP Shutdown Communication is limited to 128 octets in
   length.

   Users of this mechanism should be aware that unless a transport that
   provides integrity is used for the BGP session in question, a
   Shutdown Communication message could be forged.  Unless a transport
   that provides confidentiality is used, a Shutdown Communication
   message could be snooped by an attacker.  These issues are common to
   any BGP message but may be of greater interest in the context of this
   proposal since the information carried in the message is generally
   expected to be used for human-to-human communication.  Refer to the
   related considerations in [RFC4271] and [RFC4272].

   Users of this mechanism should consider applying data minimization
   practises as outlined in Section 6.1 [RFC6973] as a received Shutdown
   Communication may be used at the receiver's discretion.

7.  Implementation status - RFC EDITOR: REMOVE BEFORE PUBLICATION

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in RFC7942.  The
   description of implementations in this section is intended to assist
   the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to RFCs.
   Please note that the listing of any individual implementation here
   does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort has
   been spent to verify the information presented here that was supplied
   by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not be
   construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   As of today these vendors have produced an implementation of the
   Shutdown Communication:

   o  ExaBGP
   o  pmacct
   o  OpenBGPD
   o  GoBGP
   o  FreeRangeRouting (frr)
   o  tcpdump (packet analyser)
   o  Wireshark (packet analyser)
