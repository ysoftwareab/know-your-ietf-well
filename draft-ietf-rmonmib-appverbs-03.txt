4.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [RFC1155], RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 [RFC1215].
        The second version, called SMIv2, is described in RFC 2578
        [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information. The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second version of the SNMP
        message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track
        protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901]
        and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message
        protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906],
        RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information. The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is

        described in RFC 1157 [RFC1157]. A second set of protocol
        operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
        [RFC1905].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo does not specify a MIB module.

5.  Overview

There is a need for a standardized way of identifying the protocol
operations defined for particular application protocols.  Different
protocol operations can have very different performance characteristics,
and it is desirable to collect certain metrics at this level of
granularity.  This memo defines extensions to the existing protocol
identifier structure [RFC2895], and is intended to update, not obsolete,
the existing protocol identifier encoding rules.

5.1.  Protocol Identifier Framework

The RMON Protocol Identifier (PI) structure [RFC2895] allows for a
variable number of layer identifiers. Each layer contributes 4 octets to
the protocolDirID OCTET STRING and one octet to the
protocolDirParameters OCTET STRING.  These two MIB objects comprise the
index into the protocolDirTable [RFC2021], and represent a globally
unique identifier for a particular protocol encapsulation (or set of
encapsulations if the wild-card base layer is used).

5.2.  Protocol Identifier Extensions for Application Verbs

The existing RMON protocol identifier architecture requires that an
application verb be represented by one additional protocol layer,
appended to the protocol identifier for the parent application.  Since
some application verbs are defined as strings which can exceed 4 octets
in length, an integer mapping must be provided for each string.  This
memo specifies how the verb layer is structured, as well as a verb

identifier macro syntax for specification of verb name to integer
mappings.

5.3.  Terms

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119. [RFC2119]

This document uses some terms defined in the RMON Protocol Identifier
Reference document [RFC2895], and some new terms that need introduction
here.

Application Verb
     Also called simply 'verb'. Refers to one of potentially many
     protocol operations that are defined by a particular application
     protocol.

     Note that an application verb is not equivalent to an application
     protocol sub-command or opcode within a packet containing a PDU for
     the application.  An application verb is a transaction type, and
     may involve several PDU types within the application protocol
     (e.g., SNMP Get-PDU and Response-PDU).  In some applications, a
     verb may encompass protocol operations pertaining to more than one
     protocol entry in the protocol directory (e.g., ftp and ftp-data).

Connect Verb
     The special application verb associated with connection or session
     setup and tear-down traffic, and not attributed to any other verb
     for the application. This verb is assigned the enumeration value of
     zero, and the verb 'connect(0)' is implicitly defined for all
     application protocols.

Parent Application
     One of potentially many protocol encapsulations which identifies a
     particular application protocol. This term refers generically to
     any or all such encapsulations for a given set of application
     verbs.

Verb Layer
     The portion of the protocol identifier octet string which
     identifies the application verb.

Verb Set
     The group of verbs enumerated for a particular application

     protocol. The list of verb strings within a particular verb-
     identifier macro invocation is also called the verb set for that
     verb identifier.

5.4.  Relationship to the RMON-2 MIB

The RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021] contains the protocolDirTable MIB objects used
to identify all protocol encapsulations that can be monitored by a
particular RMON agent.

This memo describes how these MIB objects are mapped by an
implementation, for entries which identify application verbs. This
document does not define any new MIB objects to identify application
verbs.

5.5.  Relationship to the RMON MIB Protocol Identifier Reference

The RMON MIB Protocol Identifier Reference [RFC2895] defines the RMON
Protocol Identifier Macro Specification Language, as well as the
encoding rules for the ProtocolDirID and protocolDirParameters OCTET
STRINGs.  This memo defines extensions to the Protocol Identifier
Reference for the identification of application verb information. It
does not obsolete any portion of the Protocol Identifier Reference
document.

6.  Definitions

6.1.  Verb Identifier Macro Format

The following example is meant to introduce the verb-identifier macro.
This macro-like construct is used to represent protocol verbs for a
specific parent application.

6.1.1.  Lexical Conventions

The following keyword is added to the PI language:

     VERB-IDENTIFIER


6.1.2.  Extended Grammar for the PI Language

The following is the extended BNF notation for the grammar with starting
symbol <piFile>, for representing verb identifier macros. Note that only
the term <piFile> is actually modified from the definition in [RFC2895].

The <piDefinition> syntax is not reproduced here, since this memo is
intended to extend that definition, not replace it.

6.1.3.  Mapping of the Parent Protocol Name

The "parentProtoName" value, called the "parent protocol name" SHOULD be
an ASCII string consisting of 1 to 64 characters.  The encoding rules
are exactly as specified in section 6.2.4 of [RFC2895], for the mapping
of the protocol name field.  The value for <parentProtoName> (which is
called the "parent protocol name") MUST be the value of a protocol
identifier defined as specified for <protoName> in section 3.2.4 of
[RFC2895]. The value of <parentProtoName> MUST specify a <protoName>
defined in the <piFile>.

A protocol identifier macro SHOULD exist in the <piFile> for at least
one encapsulation of the parent application protocol, if any verb
identifier macros referencing that parent application are present in the
<piFile>.

6.1.4.  Mapping of the DESCRIPTION Clause

The DESCRIPTION clause provides a textual description of the protocol
verb set identified by this macro.  It SHOULD NOT contain details about
items covered by the DECODING and REFERENCE clauses.  The DESCRIPTION
clause MUST be present in all verb-identifier macro declarations.

6.1.5.  Mapping of the REFERENCE Clause

If a publicly available reference document exists for this set of
application protocol verbs, it SHOULD be listed here.  Typically this
will be a URL, otherwise it will be the name and address of the
controlling body.

The REFERENCE clause is optional, but SHOULD be implemented if an
authoritative reference exists which specifies the application protocol
verbs defined in the <verbList> section of this macro.

6.1.6.  Mapping of the Verb List Clause

The verb list clause MUST be present, and is used to identify a list of
application verb names, and associate a numeric constant with each verb
name. At least one verb MUST be specified, and a maximum of 16,777,215
(2^^24 - 1) verbs MAY be specified. This enumerated list SHOULD be
densely numbered and (i.e. valued from '1' to 'N', where 'N' is the
total number of verbs defined in the macro).

Internet Draft            RMON Verb Identifiers            February 2002


6.1.6.1.  Mapping of the Verb Name Field

The <verbName> field is case-sensitive, and SHOULD be set to the most
appropriate string name for each application verb.  If a readable string
is defined in an authoritative document, then that string SHOULD be
used.  If no such string exists, then an appropriate but arbitrary
string should be selected for this value.

Verb names MUST be unique for a particular parent application.  Note
that the special 'connect(0)' verb is implicitly defined for each
application protocol.  It is possible for an explicit definition of this
verb (e.g. 'connect(8)' for http) to exist for a protocol, as well as
the implicit 'connect(0)' verb.

6.1.6.2.  Mapping of the Verb Enum Field

The <verbEnum> field MUST be unique for all verbs associated with a
particular parent application.  This field SHOULD contain a value
between '1' and '16,777,215' inclusive.

6.2.  Protocol Directory Requirements

This section defines how the protocolDirTable should be populated for
any application verb identified with a verb-identifier macro.

An agent MUST implement all applicable protocolDirTable MIB objects on
behalf of each supported application verb.

6.2.1.  Mapping of the Verb Layer Numbering Space

The verb layer consists of the 4 octets within the protocolDirID INDEX
field which identify a particular application verb.

Internet Draft            RMON Verb Identifiers            February 2002


The first octet is reserved for future use and MUST be set to zero.

The next three octets identify the <verbEnum> field used to enumerate
the particular application verb represented by the <verbName> field.
This field is a 24-bit unsigned integer, encoded in network byte order.

The value zero is reserved to identify the special 'connect(0)' verb.
This verb enumeration value (i.e. '0' part of 'connect(0)') MUST NOT be
redefined in a verb identifier macro verb list.  Note that the verb name
'connect' is not reserved and MAY be redefined in a verb list.

6.2.2.  Mapping of the ProtocolDirID object

The protocolDirID OCTET STRING value for a particular application verb
is represented by the protocolDirID value for the parent application,
appended with the verb's layer identifier value.

                     Figure 2
           ProtocolDirID Format for Verbs
           ------------------------------

             protocolDirID string

        |        parent            |  verb  |
        |    protocolDirID         | layer  |
        |        string            | value  |
        +--------+--------+--------+--------+ octet
        |   length of parent ID    |   4    | count


The protocolDirID object is encoded as the protocolDirID value of the
parent application, followed by four additional octets representing the
verb layer.  The verb layer value is encoded as [0.a.b.c] where 'a' is
the high order byte, 'b' is the middle order byte, and 'c' is the low
order byte of the <verbEnum> field for the specific application verb
value. A valid PI verb enumeration will be encoded in the range
"0.0.0.0" to "0.255.255.255", where the special value "0.0.0.0" is
reserved for the implicitly defined 'connect(0)' verb.

6.2.3.  Mapping of the ProtocolDirParameters object

The protocolDirParameters OCTET STRING value for a particular
application verb is represented by the protocolDirParameters value for
the parent application, appended with one octet containing the value
zero.

Internet Draft            RMON Verb Identifiers            February 2002


6.2.4.  Mapping of the ProtocolDirLocalIndex object

The agent MUST assign an appropriate protocolDirLocalIndex value for
each application verb, according to the encoding rules defined for this
object in [RFC2021] and [RFC2895].

6.2.5.  Mapping of the protocolDirDescr object

The agent MUST convey the <verbName> value for a particular application
verb in the protocolDirDescr object.  This object SHOULD be encoded as
the protocolDirDescr value for the parent application, appended with a
'dot' character, followed by the exact text contained in the <verbName>
field.

6.2.6.  Mapping of the protocolDirType object

The agent MUST set the protocolDirType object for each application verb
to the value representing the empty bit set ( {} ).

6.2.7.  Mapping of the protocolDirAddressMapConfig object

The agent MUST set the protocolDirAddressMapConfig object for each
application verb to the value 'notSupported(1)'.

6.2.8.  Mapping of the protocolDirHostConfig object

The agent MUST set the protocolDirHostConfig object for each application
verb present in the protocol directory, according to the monitoring
capabilities for each verb. The agent MAY set this object to the same
value as configured in the parent application protocolDirHostConfig
object.  The agent MAY choose to transition this object from the value
'supportedOn(2)' to 'supportedOff(3)', if the parent application
protocolDirHostConfig object first transitions from  'supportedOn(2)' to
'supportedOff(3)'.

6.2.9.  Mapping of the protocolDirMatrixConfig object

The agent MUST set the protocolDirMatrixConfig object for each
application verb, according to the monitoring capabilities for each
verb. The agent MAY set this object to the same value as configured in
the parent application protocolDirMatrixConfig object.  The agent MAY
choose to transition this object from the value 'supportedOn(2)' to
'supportedOff(3)', if the parent application protocolDirMatrixConfig
object first transitions from  'supportedOn(2)' to 'supportedOff(3)'.

6.2.10.  Mapping of the protocolDirOwner object

This object is encoded exactly the same for application verbs as for
other protocolDirTable entries, according to the rules specified in the
RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].

6.2.11.  Mapping of the protocolDirStatus object

This object is encoded exactly the same for application verbs as for
other protocolDirTable entries, according to the rules specified in
RMON-2 MIB [RFC2021].

7.  Implementation Considerations

This section discusses the implementation implications for agents which
support verbs in the protocol directory, and the RMON collections which
utilize the protocol directory.

7.1.  Stateful Protocol Decoding

Implementations of the RMON-2 MIB for application layer and network
layer protocols typically require little if any state to be maintained
by the probe.  The probe can generally decide whether to count a packet
and its octets on the packet's own merits, without referencing or
updating any state information.

Implementations of the RMON-2 MIB at the verb layer will, for many
protocols, need to maintain state information in order to correctly
classify a packet as "belonging" to one verb or another.  The examples
below illustrate this point.

For SNMP over UDP, a Response-PDU for an SNMP Get-PDU can't be
distinguished from a Response-PDU for a Getnext-PDU.  A probe would need
to maintain state information in order to correlate a Response-PDU from
B to A with a previous request from A to B.

For application protocols carried over a stream-based transport such as
TCP, the information required to identify an application verb can span
several packets.  A probe would need to follow the transport-layer flow

7.2.  Packet Capture

For packet capture based on verb-layer protocol directory filtering, the
decision to include a packet in the capture buffer may need to be

deferred until the packet can be conclusively attributed to a particular
verb.  A probe may need to pre-buffer packets while deciding to include
or exclude them from capture based on other packets that have not yet
arrived.

7.3.  RMON-2 MIB Collections

Data collections such as the protocol distribution or AL Host Table
require that each packet is counted only once, i.e. a given packet is
fully classified as a single protocol encapsulation, which resolves to a
single leaf entry in the protocol directory.  Also, octet counters
related to protocol classification are incremented by the entire size of
packet, not just the octets associated with a particular encapsulation
layer.

It is possible that particular application protocols will allow multiple
types of verbs to be present in a single packet. In this case, the agent
MUST choose one verb type, and therefore one protocol directory entry,
in order to properly count such a packet.

It is an implementation-specific matter as to which verb type an agent
selects to identify a packet, in the event more than one verb type is
present in that packet. Some possible choices include:

    -   the first verb type encountered in the packet

    -   the verb type with the most instances in the packet

    -   the verb type using the largest number of octets in the packet

    -   the most 'interesting' verb type in the packet (based on
        knowledge of that application protocol).

8.  Appendix A: Usage Examples

The following examples are listed to demonstrate how RMON verb
identifiers are declared.

8.1.  FTP Example

This example defines verb enumeration values for the File Transfer
Protocol, as defined in RFC 959 and updated by RFC 2228 and RFC 2640.
Note that verb name strings specified in the <verbName> field are not
limited to 4 characters in length. In the FTP protocol, all the command
names are 4 characters in length, and the verb name string should match
the official command name as closely as possible.

ftp VERB-IDENTIFIER
    DESCRIPTION
      "The set of verbs for FTP is derived from the list
       of commands defined for the File Transfer Protocol,
       which are identified by case-insensitive strings.
       The commands are simply listed in the order found
       in the FTP documentation."

12.  IANA Considerations

At this time there are no application protocol verbs defined that
require IANA registration, similar to the 'ianaAssigned' protocol
identifiers found in RFC 2895. It is remotely possible that a future
version of this document will contain application verb definitions which
require assignment in the 'ianaAssigned' protocol identifier subtree.

13.  Security Considerations

This memo defines the structure of a portion of the Remote Monitoring
MIB framework, but does not define any MIB objects or protocol
operations.  It does not introduce any new security risks into a managed
system.
