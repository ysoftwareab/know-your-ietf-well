1.  Introduction

   A data center (DC) network can be composed of single or multiple
   fabrics which are also known as PODs (Points Of Delivery).  These
   fabrics may be heterogeneous due to implementation of different
   technologies when a DC network is upgraded or new techniques and
   features are rolled out.  For example, Fabric A may use VXLAN while
   Fabric B may use VLAN within a DC network.  Likewise, an existing
   fabric may use VXLAN while a new fabric, for example a fabric
   introduced for DC upgrade and expansion, may implement a technique
   discussed in NVO3 WG, such as Geneve [I-D. draft-ietf-nvo3-geneve].
   The configuration and management of such DC networks with
   heterogeneous fabrics could result in considerable complexity.

   For a DC network, a fabric can be considered as an atomic structure
   for management purposes.  From this point of view, the management of
   the DC network can be decomposed into a set of tasks to manage each
   fabric separately, as well as the fabric interconnections.  The
   advantage of this method is to make the overall management tasks
   flexible and easy to extend in the future.

Internet-Draft      Data model for DC fabric topology      November 2018


   As a basis for DC fabric management, this document defines a YANG
   data model [RFC6020][RFC7950] for a possible view of the fabric-based
   data center topology.  To do so, it augments the generic network and
   network topology data models defined in [RFC8345] with information
   that is specific to data center fabric networks.

   The model defines the generic configuration and operational state for
   a fabric-based network topology, which can subsequently be extended
   by vendors with vendor-specific information as needed.  The model can
   be used by a network controller to represent its view of the fabric
   topology that it controls and expose this view to network
   administrators or applications for DC network management.

   Within the context of topology architecture defined in [RFC8345],
   this model can also be treated as an application of the I2RS network
   topology model [RFC8345] in the scenario of data center network
   management.  It can also act as a service topology when mapping
   network elements at the fabric layer to elements of other topologies,
   such as L3 topologies as defined in [RFC8346].

   By using the fabric topology model defined in this document, people
   can treat a fabric as a holistic entity and focus on characteristics
   of a fabric (such as encapsulation type, gateway type.) as well as
   its connections to other fabrics while putting the underlay topology
   aside.  As such, clients can consume the topology information at the
   fabric level with no need to be aware of the entire set of links and
   nodes in the corresponding underlay networks.  A fabric topology can
   be configured by a network administrator using the controller by
   adding physical devices and links into a fabric.  Alternatively,
   fabric topology can be learned from the underlay network
   infrastructure.

3.  Model Overview

   This section provides an overview of the data center fabric topology
   model and its relationship with other topology models.

3.1.  Topology Model structure

   The relationship of the DC fabric topology model and other topology
   models is shown in the following figure.

       Figure 1: The network data model structure

   From the perspective of resource management and service provisioning
   for a data center network, the fabric topology model augments the
   basic network topology model with definitions and features specific
   to a DC fabric, to provide common configuration and operations for
   heterogeneous fabrics.

3.2.  Fabric Topology Model

   The fabric topology model module is designed to be generic and can be
   applied to data center fabrics built with different technologies,
   such as VLAN, VXLAN.  The main purpose of this module is to configure
   and manage fabrics and their connections.  It provides a fabric-based
   topology view for data center applications.

3.2.1.  Fabric Topology

   In the fabric topology module, a fabric is modeled as a node of a
   network, as such the fabric-based data center network consists of a
   set of fabric nodes and their connections.  The following depicts a

   snippet of the definitions to show the main structure of the model.
   The notation syntax follows [RFC8340].

       module: ietf-dc-fabric-topology
       augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:network-types:
          +--rw fabric-network!
       augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node:
          +--rw fabric-attributes
             +--rw fabric-id?   fabric-id
             +--rw name?        string
             +--rw type?        fabrictype:underlay-network-type
             +--rw description?    string
             +--rw options
             +--...
       augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
          +--ro fport-attributes
             +--ro name?          string
             +--ro role?          fabric-port-role
             +--ro type?          fabric-port-type


   The fabric topology module augments the generic ietf-network and
   ietf-network-topology modules as follows:

   o  A new topology type "ietf-dc-fabric-topology" is defined and added
      under the "network-types" container of the ietf-network module.

   o  Fabric is defined as a node under the network/node container.  A
      new container "fabric-attributes" is defined to carry attributes
      for a fabric such as gateway mode, fabric types, involved device
      nodes, and links.

   o  Termination points (in network topology module) are augmented with
      fabric port attributes defined in a container.  The "termination-
      point" here is used to represent a fabric "port" that provides
      connections to other nodes, such as an internal device, another
      fabric externally, or end hosts.

   Details of the fabric node and the fabric termination point extension
   will be explained in the following sections.

3.2.2.  Fabric node extension

   As an atomic network (that is a set of nodes and links which composes
   a POD and also supports a single overlay/underlay instance), a fabric
   itself is composed of a set of network elements i.e. devices, and
   related links.  The configuration of a fabric is contained under the

   "fabric-attributes" container depicted as follows.  The notation
   syntax follows [RFC8340].

       +--rw fabric-attributes
          +--rw fabric-id?      fabrictypes:fabric-id
          +--rw name?           string
          +--rw type?           fabrictype:underlay-network-type
          +--rw vni-capacity
          |  +--rw min?   int32
          |  +--rw max?   int32
          +--rw description?    string
          +--rw options
          |  +--rw gateway-mode?           enumeration
          |  +--rw traffic-behavior?       enumeration
          |  +--rw capability-supported* fabrictype:service-capabilities
          +--rw device-nodes* [device-ref]
          |  +--rw device-ref    fabrictype:node-ref
          |  +--rw role*?         fabrictype:device-role
          +--rw device-links* [link-ref]
          |  +--rw link-ref    fabrictype:link-ref
          +--rw device-ports* [port-ref]
             +--rw port-ref     fabrictype:tp-ref
             +--rw port-type?   fabrictypes:port-type
             +--rw bandwidth?   fabrictypes:bandwidth


   In the module, additional data objects for fabric nodes are
   introduced by augmenting the "node" list of the network module.  New
   objects include fabric name, type of the fabric, descriptions of the
   fabric as well as a set of options defined in an "options" container.
   The "options" container includes the gateway-mode type (centralized
   or distributed) and traffic-behavior (whether an Access Control Lists
   (ACLs) is needed for the traffic).  Also, it includes a list of
   device-nodes and related links as supporting-nodes to form a fabric
   network.  These device nodes and links are represented as leaf-refs
   of existing nodes and links in the underlay topology.  For the
   device-node, the "role" object is defined to represent the role of a
   device within the fabric, such as "SPINE" or "LEAF", which should
   work together with the gateway-mode.

3.2.3.  Fabric termination-point extension

   Since a fabric can be considered as a node, "termination-points" can
   represent fabric "ports" that connect to other fabrics, end hosts, as
   well as devices inside the fabric.






Zhuang, et al.            Expires May 25, 2019                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft      Data model for DC fabric topology      November 2018


   As such, the set of "termination-points" of a fabric indicate all
   connections of the fabric, including its internal connections,
   interconnections with other fabrics, and connections to end hosts.

   The structure of fabric ports is as follows.  The notation syntax
   follows [RFC8340].

   The structure of fabric ports is as follows:

       augment /nw:networks/nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
           +--ro fport-attributes
              +--ro name?          string
              +--ro role?          fabric-port-role
              +--ro type?          fabric-port-type
              +--ro device-port?   tp-ref
              +--ro (tunnel-option)?


   It augments the termination points (in network topology module) with
   fabric port attributes defined in a container.

   New nodes are defined for fabric ports including fabric name, role of
   the port within the fabric (internal port, external port to outside
   network, access port to end hosts), port type (L2 interface, L3
   interface).  By defining the device-port as a tp-ref, a fabric port
   can be mapped to a device node in the underlay network.

   Also, a new container for tunnel-options is introduced to present the
   tunnel configuration on a port.

   The termination point information is learned from the underlay
   networks, not configured by the fabric topology layer.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or
   RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport
   layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure
   Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the
   mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol

   operations and content.  The subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability in the ietf-dc-fabric-topology module are
   as follows:

   fabric-attributes: A malicious client could attempt to sabotage the
   configuration of important fabric attributes, such as device-nodes or
   type.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  The subtrees and data nodes and
   their sensitivity/vulnerability in the ietf-dc-fabric-topology module
   are as follows:

   fport-attributes: A malicious client could attempt to read the
   connections of fabrics without permission, such as device-port, name.

Appendix A.  Non NMDA -state modules

   The YANG module ietf-dc-fabric-topology defined in this document
   augments two modules, ietf-network and ietf-network-topology, that
   are designed to be used in conjunction with implementations that
   support the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined
   in [RFC8342].  In order to allow implementations to use the model
   even in case when NMDA is not supported, a set of companion modules
   have been defined that represent a state model of networks and
   network topologies, ietf-network-state and ietf-network-topology-
   state, respectively.

   In order to be able to use the model for fabric topologies defined in
   this in this document in conjunction with non-NMDA compliant
   implementations, a corresponding companion module needs to be
   introduced as well.  This companion module, ietf-dc-fabric-topology-
   state, mirrors ietf-dc-fabric-topology.  However, the module augments
   ietf-network-state (instead of ietf-network and ietf-network-
   topology) and all of its data nodes are non-configurable.

   Like ietf-network-state and ietf-network-topology-state, ietf-dc-
   fabric-topology-state SHOULD NOT be supported by implementations that
   support NMDA.  It is for this reason that the module is defined in
   the Appendix.

   The definition of the module follows below.  As the structure of the
   module mirrors that of its underlying module, the YANG tree is not
   depicted separately.

          "This module contains a collection of YANG definitions for
          Fabric state, representing topology that is either learned,
