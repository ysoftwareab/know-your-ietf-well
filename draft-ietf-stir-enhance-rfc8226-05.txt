          Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints for STIR Certificates
                   draft-ietf-stir-enhance-rfc8226-05

Abstract

   RFC 8226 specifies the use of certificates for Secure Telephone
   Identity Credentials, and these certificates are often called "STIR
   Certificates".  RFC 8226 provides a certificate extension to
   constrain the JSON Web Token (JWT) claims that can be included in the
   Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) as defined in RFC 8225.  If the
   PASSporT signer includes a JWT claim outside the constraint
   boundaries, then the PASSporT recipient will reject the entire
   PASSporT.  This document updates RFC 8226; it provides all of the
   capabilities available in the original certificate extension as well
   as an additional way to constrain the allowable JWT claims.  The
   enhanced extension can also provide a list of claims that are not
   allowed to be included in the PASSporT.

1.  Introduction

   The use of certificates [RFC5280] in establishing authority over
   telephone numbers is described in [RFC8226].  These certificates are
   often called "STIR Certificates".  STIR certificates are an important
   element of the overall system that prevents the impersonation of
   telephone numbers on the Internet.

   Section 8 of [RFC8226] provides a certificate extension to constrain
   the JSON Web Token (JWT) claims that can be included in the Personal
   Assertion Token (PASSporT) [RFC8225].  If the PASSporT signer
   includes a JWT claim outside the constraint boundaries, then the
   PASSporT recipient will reject the entire PASSporT.

   This document defines an enhanced JWTClaimConstraints certificate
   extension, which provides all of the capabilities available in the
   original certificate extension as well as an additional way to
   constrain the allowable JWT claims.  That is, the enhanced extension
   can provide a list of claims that are not allowed to be included in
   the PASSporT.

Internet-Draft         EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints             July 2021


   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension is needed to
   limit the authority when a parent STIR certificate delegates to a
   subordinate STIR certificate.  For example,
   [I-D.ietf-stir-cert-delegation] describes the situation where service
   providers issue a STIR certificate to enterprises or other customers
   to sign PASSporTs, and the Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate
   extension can be used to prevent specific claims from being included
   in PASSporTs and accepted as valid by the PASSporT recipient.

   The JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension defined in [RFC8226]
   provides a list of claims that must be included in a valid PASSporT
   as well as a list if permitted values for selected claims.  The
   Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension defined in this
   document includes those capabilities and adds a list of claims that
   must not be included in a valid PASSporT.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints Syntax

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension is non-
   critical, applicable only to end-entity certificates, and defined
   with ASN.1 [X.680].  The syntax of the JWT claims in a PASSporT is
   specified in [RFC8225].

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension is optional,
   but when present, it constrains the JWT claims that authentication
   services may include in the PASSporT objects they sign.  Constraints
   are applied by certificate issuers and enforced by recipients when
   validating PASSporT claims as follows:

   1.  mustInclude indicates JWT claims that MUST appear in the PASSporT
       in addition to the iat, orig, and dest claims.  The baseline
       PASSporT claims ("iat", "orig", and "dest") are considered to be
       required by [RFC8225], and these claims SHOULD NOT be part of the
       mustInclude list.  If mustInclude is absent, the iat, orig, and
       dest claims MUST appear in the PASSporT.

   2.  permittedValues indicates that if the claim name is present, the
       claim MUST exactly match one of the listed values.

Internet-Draft         EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints             July 2021


   3.  mustExclude indicates JWT claims that MUST NOT appear in the
       PASSporT.  The baseline PASSporT claims ("iat", "orig", and
       "dest") are always permitted, and these claims MUST NOT be part
       of the mustExclude list.  If one of these baseline PASSporT
       claims appears in the mustExclude list, then the certificate MUST
       be treated as if the extension was not present.

   Following the precedent in [RFC8226], JWT Claim Names MUST be ASCII
   strings, which are also known as strings using the International
   Alphabet No. 5 [ISO646].

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension is
   identified by the following object identifier (OID):

       id-pe-eJWTClaimConstraints OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pe 33 }

   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension has the
   following syntax:

       EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints ::= SEQUENCE {
         mustInclude [0] JWTClaimNames OPTIONAL,
           -- The listed claim names MUST appear in the PASSporT
           -- in addition to iat, orig, and dest.  If absent, iat, orig,
           -- and dest MUST appear in the PASSporT.
         permittedValues [1] JWTClaimValuesList OPTIONAL,
           -- If the claim name is present, the claim MUST contain one
           -- of the listed values.
         mustExclude [2] JWTClaimNames OPTIONAL }
           -- The listed claim names MUST NOT appear in the PASSporT.
       ( WITH COMPONENTS { ..., mustInclude PRESENT } |
         WITH COMPONENTS { ..., permittedValues PRESENT } |
         WITH COMPONENTS { ..., mustExclude PRESENT } )

       JWTClaimValuesList ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF JWTClaimValues

       JWTClaimValues ::= SEQUENCE {
         claim JWTClaimName,
         values SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF UTF8String }

       JWTClaimNames ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF JWTClaimName

       JWTClaimName ::= IA5String

4.  Usage Examples

   Consider these usage examples with a PASSporT claim called
   "confidence" with values "low", "medium", and "high".  These examples
   illustrate the constraints that are imposed by mustInclude,
   permittedValues, and mustExclude:

   *  If a CA issues a certificate to an authentication service that
      includes an Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
      that contains the mustInclude JWTClaimName "confidence", then an
      authentication service is required to include the "confidence"
      claim in all PASSporTs it generates and signs.  A verification
      service will treat as invalid any PASSporT it receives without a
      "confidence" PASSporT claim.

   *  If a CA issues a certificate to an authentication service that
      includes an Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
      that contains the permittedValues JWTClaimName "confidence" and a
      permitted "high" value, then a verification service will treat as
      invalid any PASSporT it receives with a PASSporT "confidence"
      claim with a value other than "high".  However, a verification
      service will not treat as invalid a PASSporT it receives without a
      PASSporT "confidence" claim at all, unless "confidence" also
      appears in mustInclude.

   *  If a CA issues a certificate to an authentication service that
      includes an Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
      that contains the mustExclude JWTClaimName "confidence", then a
      verification service will treat as invalid any PASSporT it
      receives with a PASSporT "confidence" claim regardless of the
      claim value.

5.  Certificate Extension Example

   A certificate containing an example of the
   EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints certificate extension is provided in
   Figure 1.  The certificate is provided in the format described in
   [RFC7468].  The example of the EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints extension
   from the certificate is shown in Figure 2.  The example imposes four
   constraints:

   1.  The "confidence" claim must be present in the PASSporT.

   2.  The "confidence" claim must have a value of "high" or "medium".

   3.  The "priority" claim must not be present in the PASSporT.

   IANA assigns the object identifier for the certificate extension.

6.  Guidance to Certification Authorities

   The EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints extension specified in this document
   and the JWTClaimConstraints extension specified in [RFC8226] MUST NOT
   both appear in the same certificate.

   If the situation calls for mustExclude constraints, then the
   EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints extension is the only extension that can
   express the constraints.

   On the other hand, if the situation does not call for mustExclude
   constraints, then either the EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints extension or
   the JWTClaimConstraints extension can express the constraints.  Until
   such time as support for the EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints extension
   becomes widely implemented, the use of the JWTClaimConstraints
   extension may be more likely to be supported.  This guess is based on
   the presumption that the first specified extension will be
   implemented more widely in the next few years.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes use of object identifiers for the Enhanced JWT
   Claim Constraints certificate extension defined in Section 3 and the
   ASN.1 module identifier defined in Appendix A.  Therefore, IANA has
   made the following assignments within the SMI Numbers Registry.

   For the Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension in the
   "SMI Security for PKIX Certificate Extension" (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.1)
   registry:

         33  id-pe-eJWTClaimConstraints

   For the ASN.1 module identifier in the "SMI Security for PKIX Module
   Identifier" (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.0) registry:

         101  id-mod-eJWTClaimConstraints-2021

8.  Security Considerations

   For further information on certificate security and practices, see
   [RFC5280], especially the Security Considerations section.

   Since non-critical certificate extension are ignored by
   implementations that do not recognize the extension object identifier
   (OID), constraints on PASSporT validation will only be applied by
   relying parties that recognize the EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints
   extension.

Internet-Draft         EnhancedJWTClaimConstraints             July 2021


   The Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension can be used
   by certificate issuers to provide limits on the acceptable PASSporTs
   that can be accepted by verification services.  Enforcement of these
   limits depends upon proper implementation by the verification
   services.  The digital signature on the PASSportT data structure will
   be valid even if the limits are violated.

   Use of the Enhanced JWT Claim Constraints certificate extension
   permittedValues constraint is most useful when the claim definition
   allows a specified set of values.  In this way, all of the values
   that are not listed in the JWTClaimValuesList are prohibited in a
   valid PASSporT.

   Certificate issuers must take care when imposing constraints on the
   PASSporT claims and the claim values that can successfully validated;
   some combinations can prevent any PASSporT from being successfully
   validated by the certificate.  For example, an entry in mustInclude
   and an entry in mustExclude for the same claim will prevent
   successful validation on any PASSporT.

   Certificate issuers SHOULD NOT include an entry in mustExclude for
   the "rcdi" claim for a certificate that will be used with the
   PASSporT Extension for Rich Call Data defined in
   [I-D.ietf-stir-passport-rcd].  Excluding this claim would prevent the
   integrity protection mechanism from working properly.

   Certificate issuers must take care when performing certificate
   renewal [RFC4949] to include exactly the same Enhanced JWT Claim
   Constraints certificate extension in the new certificate as the old
   one.  Renewal usually takes place before the old certificate expires,
   so there is a period of time where both the new certificate and the
   old certificate are valid.  If different constraints appear in the
   two certificates with the same public key, some PASSporTs might be
   valid when one certificate is used and invalid when the other one is
   used.
