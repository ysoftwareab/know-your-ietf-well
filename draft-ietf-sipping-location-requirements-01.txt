Abstract 

   This document presents the framework and requirements for usage of 
   the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [RFC 3261] to convey user 
   location information from a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user 
   agent to another SIP entity.  We consider cases where location 
   information is conveyed from end to end, as well as cases where 
   message routing by intermediaries is influenced by the location of 
   the session initiator.  We offer a set of solutions to the 
   requirements, based on the scenario(s) being addressed.

1.  Introduction

   This document presents the framework and requirements for the usage 
   of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) [1] for conveyance of user 
   location information object described by [7] from a SIP User Agent 
   to another SIP entity. 

   There are several situations in which it is appropriate for SIP to 
   be used to convey Location Information (LI) from one SIP entity to 
   another.  This document specifies requirements when a SIP UAC knows 
   its location by some means not specified herein, and needs to inform
   another SIP entity.  One example is to reach your nearest pizza 
   parlor.  A chain of pizza parlors may have a single well known uri 
   (sip:pizzaparlor.com), that is forwarded to the closest franchise by
   the pizzaparlor.com proxy server.  The receiving franchise UAS uses 
   the location information of the UAC to schedule your delivery. 

   Another important example is emergency calling.  A call to 


Polk & Rosen                                                   [Page 2]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

   sip:sos@example.com is an emergency call as in [3].  The example.com
   proxy server must route the call to the correct emergency response 
   center (ERC) determined by the location of the caller. At the ERC, 
   the UAS must determine the correct police/fire/ambulance/... 
   service, which is also based on your location.  In many 
   jurisdictions, accurate location information of the caller in 
   distress is a required component of a call to an emergency center.

   A third example is a direction service, which might give you verbal 
   directions to a venue from your present position.  This is a case 
   where only the destination UAS needs to receive the location 
   information. 

   This document does not discuss how the UAC discovers or is 
   configured with its location (either coordinate or civic based).  It
   also does not discuss the contents of the Location Object (LO).  It 
   does specify the requirements for the "using protocol" in [7].

   Sections 7, 8 and 9 give specific examples (in well-formed SIP 
   messages) of SIP UA and Proxy behavior for location conveyance, the 
   last of which is a section devoted to the unique circumstances 
   regarding emergency calling.  Section 10 addresses how this document
   adheres to the requirements specified in [7] (Geopriv Requirements).
   Sections 11 and 12 list the current open issues with location 
   conveyance in SIP, and the new open issues recently discovered as a 
   result of the added effort to this revision.  


1.1  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL 
   NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described 
   in [2].


1.2  Changes from Prior Versions

[NOTE TO RFC-EDITOR: If this document is to be published as an RFC, 
this section is to be removed prior to that event.]

   This is a list of the changes that have been made from the -00 
   working group version of this ID to this version:

   - Added the offered solution in detail (with message flows, 
     appropriate SIP Methods for location conveyance, and 

   - Synchronized the requirements here with those from the Geopriv 
     Working Group's (attempting to eliminate overlap)

   - Took on the task of making this effort the SIP "using protocol" 
     specification from Geopriv's POV


Polk & Rosen                                                   [Page 3]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

   - Refined the Open Issues section to reflect the progress we've made
     here, and to indicate what we have discovered needs addressing, 
     but has not been to date.

   This is a list of the changes that have been made from the -01 
   individual submission version to the WG -00 version of this ID:

   - Brian Rosen was brought on as a co-author

   - Requirements that a location header were negatively received in 
     the previous version of this document.  AD and chair advice was to
     move all location information into a message body (and stay away 
     from headers)

   - Added a section of "emergency call" specific requirements

   - Added an Open Issues section to mention what hasn't been resolved 
     yet in this effort

   This is a list of the changes that have been made from the 
   individual submission version -00 to the -01 version

   - Added the IPR Statement section

   - Adjusted a few requirements based on suggestions from the 
     Minneapolis meeting

   - Added requirements that the UAC is to include from where it 
     learned its location in any transmission of its LI

   - Distinguished the facts (known to date) that certain jurisdictions
     relieve persons of their right to privacy when they call an ERC, 
     while other jurisdictions maintain a person's right to privacy, 
     while still others maintain a person's right to privacy - but only
     if they ask that their service be set up that way.

   - Made the decision that TLS is the security mechanism for location 
     conveyance in emergency communications (vs. S/MIME, which is still
     the mechanism for UA-to-UA non-emergency location conveyance 
     cases). 

   - Added the Open Issue of whether a Proxy can insert location 
     information into an emergency SIP INVITE message, and some of the 
     open questions surrounding the implications of that action

   - added a few names to the acknowledgements section


2.  In the Body or in a Header

   When one user agent wants to inform another user agent where they 
   are, it seems reasonable to have this accomplished by placing the 


Polk & Rosen                                                   [Page 4]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

   location information (coordinate or civic) in an S/MIME registered 
   and encoded message body, and sending it as part of a SIP request or
   response.  No routing of the request based on the location 
   information is required in this case; therefore no SIP Proxies 
   between these two UAs need to view the location information 
   contained in the SIP messages.

   Although SIP [1} does not permit a proxy server to modify or delete 
   a body, there is no restriction on viewing bodies.  However, S/MIME 
   protection implemented on bodies is only specified between UAS and 
   UAC, and if engaged, would render the location object opaque to a 
   proxy server for any desired modification if it is not correct or 
   precise enough from that proxy's point of view (were it to be able 
   to view it).  This problem is similar to that raised in Session 
   Policy [8], where an intermediary may need information in a body, 
   such as IP address of media streams or codec choices to route a call 
   properly.  Requirements in [8] are applicable to routing based on 
   location, and are incorporated in these requirements by reference.

   It is conceivable to create a new header for location information.  
   However, [7] prefers S/MIME for security of Location Information, 
   and indeed S/MIME is preferable in SIP for protecting one part of a 
   message.  Accordingly, these requirements specify location be 
   carried in a body.

   It is the use of S/MIME however, that limits routing based on 
   location.  Therefore, it seems appropriate to require that, where 
   routing is dependent on location, protection of the location 
   information object be accomplished by other mechanisms: here TLS
   ("sips:" from [1]).  It is envisioned that S/MIME SHOULD be used 
   when location information is not required by proxy servers, and TLS 
   MUST be used when it is.  The UAC will need to know the difference 
   in the call's intent as to which security mechanism to engage for LI
   conveyance.

   This document does not address the behavior or configuration of SIP 
   Proxy Servers in these cases in order to accomplish location-
   sensitive routing.  That is out of scope, and left for further 
   (complementary) efforts.


3.  Scope of Location in a Message Body 

   As concluded from the previous section, location information is to 
   be contained within a message body.  If either another body (SDP for
   example) is also to be sent in the message, or the LI is to be 
   protected with S/MIME, the rules stated in section 7 of [1] 
   regarding multipart MIME bodies MUST be followed.  The format and 
   privacy/security rules of the location information SHOULD be defined
   within the Geopriv WG.

Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

4.  Requirements for UA-to-UA Location Conveyance

   The following are the requirements for UA-to-UA Location Conveyance 
   Situations where routing is not based on the LI of either UA:

    U-U1 - MUST work with dialog-initiating SIP Requests and responses,
           as well as the SIP MESSAGE method [4], and SHOULD work with 
           most SIP messages.

    U-U2 - UAC Location information SHOULD remain confidential in route
           to the destination UA.

    U-U3 - The privacy and security rules established within the
           Geopriv Working Group that would categorize SIP as a 'using 
           protocol' MUST be met [7].


    U-U4 - The LI MUST be contained in the LO as defined in [13], 
           which will satisfy all format requirements for 
           interoperability.

    U-U5 - The requirements of a "using protocol" by RFC 3693 
           (Geopriv Requirements) MUST be met.


5.  Requirements for UA-to-Proxy Server Location Conveyance

   The following are the requirements for UA-to-Proxy Server Location 
   Conveyance situations:

    U-PS1 - MUST work with dialog-initiating SIP Requests and 
            responses, as well as the SIP MESSAGE method[4], and SHOULD
            work with most SIP messages.

    U-PS2 - UAC location information SHOULD remain confidential with 
            respect to entities to which the location information is 
            not addressed, but MUST be useable by intermediary proxy 
            servers.

    U-PS3 - The privacy and security rules established within the 
            Geopriv Working Group which would categorize SIP as a 
            'using protocol' MUST be met [7].

    U-PS4 - Modification or removal of the LO by proxy servers MUST NOT
            be required (as [1] currently forbids this).

    U-PS5 - any mechanism used to prevent unwanted observation of this 
            Location Information CANNOT fail the SIP Request if not 
            understood by intermediary SIP entities or the destination 
            UAS.




Polk & Rosen                                                   [Page 6]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

    U-PS6 - Proxy Servers that do not or cannot understand the Location
            Information in the message body for routing purposes MUST 
            NOT fail the SIP Request.

    U-PS7 û It MUST be possible for a proxy server to assert the 
            validity of the location information provided by the UA.  
            Alternatively, it is acceptable for there to be a mechanism
            for a proxy server to assert a location object itself.


6. Additional Requirements for Emergency Calls

   Emergency calls have requirements that are not generally important 
   to other uses for location in SIP:

   Emergency calls presently have between 2 and 8-second call setup 
   times.  There is ample evidence that the longer call setup end of 
   the range causes an unacceptable number of callers to abandon the 
   call before it is completed.  Two-second call completion time is a 
   goal of many existing emergency call centers.  Allocating 25% of the
   call set up for processing privacy concerns seems reasonable; 1 
   second would be 50% of the goal, which seems unacceptable; less than
   0.5 second seems unachievable, therefore:

    E-1 - Privacy mechanisms MUST add no more than 0.5 second of call 
          setup time when implemented in present technology UAs and 
          Proxy Servers.  

   It may be acceptable for full privacy mechanisms related to the 
   location of the UAC (and it's user) to be tried on an initial 
   attempt to place a call, as long as the call attempt may be retried
   without the mechanism if the first attempt fails.  Abandoning 
   privacy in cases of failure of the privacy mechanism might be 
   subject to user preference, although such a feature would be within
   the domain of a UA implementation and thus not subject to 
   standardization.  It should be noted that some jurisdictions have 
   laws that explicitly deny any expectation of location privacy when 
   making an emergency call, while others grant the user the ability to
   remain anonymous even when calling an ERC.  So far, this has been 
   offered in some jurisdictions, but the user within that jurisdiction
   must state this preference, as it is not the default configuration. 

    E-2 û Privacy mechanisms MUST NOT be mandatory for successful 
          conveyance of location during an (sos-type) emergency call.

    E-3 - It MUST be possible to provide a privacy mechanism (that does
          not violate the other requirements within this document) to a
          user within a jurisdiction that gives that user the right to 
          choose not to reveal their location even when contacting an 
          ERC.




Polk & Rosen                                                   [Page 7]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

    E-4 û The retention and retransmission policy of the ERC MUST be 
          able to be made available to the user, and override the 
          user's normal policy when local regulation governs such 
          retention and retransmission (but does not violate 
          requirement E-3).  As in E-2 above, requiring the use of the 
          ERC's retention and/or retransmission policy may be subject 
          to user preference although in most jurisdictions, local laws
          specify such policies and may not be overridden by user 
          preference.

   Location information is considered so important during emergency 
   calls, that it is to be transmitted even when it is not considered 
   reliable, or might even be wrong.  For example, some application 
   might know that the DHCP reply with location information was 
   overwritten recently (or exactly) when a VPN connection was 
   activated.  This could, and likely will, provide any new location 
   information to the UA from somewhere far away from the UA (perhaps 
   the user's corporate facility).

    E-5 Location information MUST be transmitted, if known to the UAC, 
        in all calls to an ERC, even in the case it is not considered 
        reliable.

   With that in mind, it is important to distinguish the location 
   information learned locally from LI learned over a VPN; which in 
   itself is useful additional information to that ERC operator. 

    E-7 THE UA must provide the actual LI of the endpoint, and not 
        location which might have been erroneously given to it by, e.g.
        a VPN tunnel DHCP server.


7.  Location Conveyance using SIP  

   Geopriv is the IETF working group assigned to define a Location 
   Object for carrying within another protocol to convey geographic 
   location of an endpoint to another entity.  This Location Object 
   will be supplied within SIP to convey location of a UA (or user of a
   UA).  The Location Object (LO) is defined in [13]. Section 26 of [1]
   defines the security functionality SIPS for transporting SIP 
   messages with either TLS or IPsec, and S/MIME for encrypting message
   bodies from SIP intermediaries that would otherwise have access to 
   reading the clear-text bodies.  For UA-to-UA location conveyance, 
   using the PIDF-LO body satisfies the entire format and message-
   handling requirements as stated in the baseline Geopriv requirements
   [7].  SIP entities that will carry an LO MUST IMPLEMENT S/MIME for 
   encrypting on an end-to-end basis the location of a user agent, 
   satisfying [7]'s security requirements.  The SIPS-URI from [1] 
   SHOULD also be used for further message protection (message 
   integrity, authentication and message confidentiality) and MUST be 
   used when S/MIME is not used.  The entities sending and receiving 
   the LO MUST implement the privacy and security instructions in the 


Polk & Rosen                                                   [Page 8]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

   LO.

   Self-signed certificates SHOULD NOT be used for protecting LI, as 
   the sender does not have a secure identity of the recipient.

   Several LOs MAY be included in a body as long as the message length 
   is less than the maximum permitted for a single message in the 
   network the Location will be conveyed within. 

   Several SIP Methods are capable (and applicable) to carry the LO.  
   The Methods are divided into two groups, one for those applicable 
   for UA-to-UA location conveyance, and the other group for UA-to-
   Proxy Location conveyance for routing the message.

   The list of applicable Methods for UA-to-UA location conveyance is: 

      INVITE, 
      UPDATE, 
      MESSAGE, and
      PUBLISH. 

   The list of applicable Methods for UA-to-Proxy location conveyance 
   is: 

      INVITE, 
      UPDATE, and maybe 
      MESSAGE

   While the authors do not yet see a reason to have location conveyed 
   in the OPTIONS, ACK, PRACK, BYE, REFER and CANCEL Methods, we do not
   see a reason to prevent carrying a LO within these Method Requests 
   as long as the SIP message meets the requirements stated within this
   document. 

   A 200 OK to an INVITE can carry the UAS's LO back to the UAC that 
   provided their location in the INVITE, but this is not something 
   that can be required due to the timing of the INVITE to 200 OK 
   messages, with potential local/user policy requiring the called user
   to get involved in determining if the caller is someone they wish to
   give location to (and at what precision).

   There is an open question as to whether the SUBSCRIBE and NOTIFY 
   Methods should be addressed in this document, or another document at
   a later date.  This combination of Methods would be used in SIP by 
   having a UA or SIP Server offering a subscription to another UA for 
   the purposes of location refresh if the subscribed-to UA changes 
   location within a given time interval.  This capability is not 
   currently considered critical, and considered "phase II" within the
   Geopriv working group, but it is an open question here as to whether
   the SIP/SIPPING WGs want this to be specified here as a behavior (it
   should be pretty straight forward).



Polk & Rosen                                                   [Page 9]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

   For UA-to-Proxy location conveyance, there are two cases: one in 
   which all proxies on the path from the UA to the proxy that requires
   location can be trusted with the LI, and one in which intermediate 
   proxies may not be trusted.  The former may be implemented with 
   "hop-by-hop" security as specified in [1] using sips: (i.e. TLS 
   security).   In particular, emergency call routing requires routing
   proxies to know location, and sips: protection is appropriate.  The
   latter case is under study by the SIPPING working group under the 
   subject "End to Middle" security [12].  

   Regardless which scenario (UA-to-UA or UA-to-Proxy) is used to 
   convey location, SIP entities MUST adhere to the rules of [7], 
   specifically the retention and distribution (privacy) attributes of 
   a UA's location.  When Alice is deciding how to transmit her 
   location, she should be keenly aware of the parameters in which she 
   wants her location to be stored and distributed.  However, once she 
   sends that location information to Bob, he MUST also now obey 
   Alice's wishes regarding these privacy attributes if he is deciding 
   to inform another party about Alice.  This is a fundamental 
   principle of the Geopriv Working Group, i.e. "PRIVACY".


8.  User Agent-to-User Agent Location Conveyance

   The offered solution here for the User-to-User solution for location
   conveyance between UAs is used with the INVITE, UPDATE, MESSAGE, and
   PUBLISH Methods in the following subsections.

8.1 UA-to-UA using INVITE Method

   Below is a common SIP session set-up sequence between two user 
   agents.  In this example, Alice will provide Bob with her geographic
   location in the INVITE message.

Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

   User agent Alice INVITEs user agent Bob to a session [M1 of Figure 
   1].  Within this INVITE is a multipart body indication that it is 
   S/MIME encrypted [according to the rules of 1] by Alice for Bob.  
   One body part contains the SDP offered by Alice to Bob.  Alice's 
   location (here coordinate based) is the other body part contained in
   this INVITE.  Bob responses with a 200 OK [M2] (choosing a codec as 
   specified by the Offer/Answer Model [14]).  Bob can include his 
   location in the 200 OK response, but this shouldn't be expected due 
   to user timing.  If Bob wants to provide his location to Alice after
   the 200 OK, but before a BYE, the UPDATE Method [9] should be used. 
   Alice's UA replies with an ACK and the session is set up.

   Figure 1. does not include any Proxies because in it assumed they 
   would not affect the session set-up with respect to whether or not 
   Alice's location is in a message body part, and Proxies don't react 
   to S/MIME bodies, making their inclusion more or less moot and more 
   complex than necessary.

   The most relevant message in Figure 1 having to do with location is 
   (obviously) the message with the location object in it [M1].  So to 
   cut down on length of this document, only the INVITE message in this
   example will be shown. Section 8.1.1 will give an example of this 
   well formed INVITE message using a Coordinate location format.  
   Section 8.1.2 will give an example of this well formed INVITE 
   message using the civic location format.

8.1.3 UA-to-UA Location Conveyance Involving 3 Users

   In the following example, Alice presents her location in the INVITE 
   to Bob, which Bob 200 OKs with his location as well.  Bob then 
   directs Alice to contact Carol with both their locations in the same
   message.  The REFER Method [15] is used in the message sequence, but
   it does not carry anyone's location within the REFER message.  This 
   example is here to show a 3-way communication of location, coupled 
   with how a UA can include someone else's location.  This has 
   security implications due to neither primary party in the last 
   location transfer being the owner of the location information.  
   Alice (in this case) MUST adhere to the retention and distribution 
   privacy requirements within Bob's location object regarding his 
   location information prior to considering its inclusion in the 
   INVITE to Carol.

8.1.3.1 UA-to-UA REFER with Civic Location Using S/MIME

   In Figure 1a., we have an example message flow involving the REFER 
   Method.  The REFER itself does not carry location objects.

   We are not including all the messages for space reasons.  M1 is a 
   well-formed SIP message that contains Alice's location.  M2 is Bob's
   200 OK in response to Alice's INVITE, and it contains Bob's 
   Location.

   Bob REFERs Alice to Carol, and in M7, Alice includes both locations 
   in a single SIP message.  This is possible because Bob set his 
   retention value to "yes", thus allowing Alice to pass his location 
   on to Carol.

   It is an open question of whether there should be a mechanism to 
   request or require the transmission of an LO.  The LO is contained 
   in a body, so the usual sip mechanisms do not apply.


8.2 UA-to-UA Using MESSAGE Method

   Anytime a user transmits geographic location outside of an INVITE 
   Request to another user, the MESSAGE Method is to be used.  This 
   applies even when two users are in an existing dialog.  The logic 
   here is as follows:

      - a NOTIFY isn't appropriate because there was not a SUBSCRIBE 
        performed and accepted. 

      - a UPDATE isn't appropriate because it is for the updating of 
        session capabilities and parameters before a dialog is 
        established, but after a dialog request has been sent.  If 
        Alice and Bob were in an existing dialog, UPDATE is already 
        outside its window of usage based on [9]. 

   There is one exception to this for UA-to-UA conveyance: if Alice 
   sent her location in an INVITE, but has moved before receiving a
   200 OK, her UA may send an UPDATE to Bob with new location 
   information.

   NOTE: A similar use for UPDATE is within the UA-to-Proxy Location 
         Conveyance section of this document.

      - reINVITE isn't appropriate because it is only used (or only 
        supposed to be used) for changing the capabilities and/or 
        parameters of an existing dialog.  Transferring location has 
        nothing in the UA-to-UA conveyance case to do with the actual 
        dialog, so it does not apply here.

   This leaves MESSAGE as the only viable Request Method for location 
   conveyance outside of a dialog between two users (Alice and Bob in 
   this case).

      Figure 2. UA-UA with Location in MESSAGE

   Section 8.2.1 will give the well formed MESSAGE message containing a
   well formed Geopriv Location Object using the Coordinate location 
   format that is fully complying with all security requirements - SIPS
   for hop-by-hop security, and S/MIME for message body confidentiality
   end-to-end, as well as adhering to the retention and distribution 
   concerns from [7].  Section 8.2.2 will show the Civic Location 
   format alternative to the same location, as conveyed from Alice to 
   Bob.  This section does not adhere to confidentiality or integrity 
   concerns of [7], but does convey retention and distribution 
   indicators from Alice.


8.2.1 UA-to-UA MESSAGE with Coordinate Location Using S/MIME

   Below is M1 from Figure 2 in section 8.2. that is fully secure and 
   in compliance with Geopriv requirements in [7] for security 
   concerns.

8.3 UA-to-UA Location Conveyance Using UPDATE

   UPDATE MUST NOT be used to send geographic location from UA-to-UA 
   unless location has already been sent in an INVITE that was the 
   first message in the same dialog set-up.  The same security 
   properties used in the INVITE MUST be used in the UPDATE message.  
   The only reason for sending location in an UPDATE message is if 
   Alice's UA (in the common example used throughout this document) has
   moved prior to receiving Bob's 200 OK to the original INVITE.  How 
   this movement is determined is outside the scope of this document, 
   but ultimately should be configurable by local administration or the
   user of the UA.  By how much Alice has moved to trigger the "sense 
   of movement" (i.e. the need to send new location) to Bob is outside 
   the scope of this document, but ultimately should be configurable by
   local administration or the user of the UA.  

   In Figure 3., we have an example message flow involving the UPDATE 


Polk & Rosen                                                  [Page 26]

   Method. We are not including all the messages for space reasons.  M1
   is a well formed SIP message that contains Alice's location. During 
   the session set-up, Alice's UA knows it has moved while knowing too 
   the session has not been formally accepted by Bob.  Alice's UA 
   decides to update Bob with her new location with an UPDATE Method 
   message.   Messages M2, M3 and M4 have nothing to do with location 
   conveyance, therefore will not be shown in detail.  Only M1 and M5 
   will be shown.

8.4 UA-to-UA Location Conveyance Using PUBLISH

   ** This section could not be completed before submission time and 
   will be completed shortly after IETF60 (unless). A thousand pardons.


9.  Special Considerations for Emergency Calls

   When a Proxy Server knows to look for the location message body to 
   route an emergency call as in [11].



Polk & Rosen                                                  [Page 30]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004


   Emergency calls, which might be detected as detailed in 3, have 
   special rules for conveyance of location:

      1. An emergency call MUST have all LI available to the UA, if 
         any, sent with the INVITE, and subsequent UPDATE or reINVITE 
         messages as a PIDF-LO in a body

      2. The LO must be protected with sips: UNLESS the attempt to 
         establish hop-by-hop TLS connections fails and cannot 
         reasonably be established in a very short (less than a second)
         time.  In such a case, the LO SHOULD be sent without TLS ONLY
         for those hops that cannot support TLS establishment.

      3. User Agents MUST NOT use S/MIME
   
      Proxies MUST NOT remove a location message body at any time.  If 
      there is a condition that a Proxy adds a location message body, 
      it:

      4. MUST NOT produce a message length over current SIP message 
         limits (1300 bytes [per 3428])

      5. MUST indicate within that added message body that body came 
         from that server (by some naming convention not defined here)


9.1 UA-to-Proxy Routing the Message with INVITE (secure)

   When Alice signifies "sos@" [per 3], her UA must understand this 
   message MUST NOT use S/MIME for the message body, because this is an
   emergency call - otherwise the message will not properly route to 
   the correct destination.  Two definite possibilities will exist for 
   how this message flow will occur [note: the message flows are not 
   being defined here, they are defined in [11], but two are shown here
   to show the messages themselves].  The first possibility has Alice 
   sending her INVITE to her first hop Proxy, which recognizes the 
   message as an emergency message.  The Proxy knows to look into the 
   message bodies for the location body; determine where Alice is and 
   route the call to the appropriate ERC.  This is shown in Figure 4A.

   Once the Proxy receives M1 and recognizes it as an emergency INVITE 
   Request, this proxy knows to look into the message body for a 
   location body part to determine the location of the UAC in order to 
   match the location to an ERC.  Once this look-up occurs, the message 
   is sent directly to the ERC (in message [M2]).

   The second probability in message flows is in Figure 4B. in which 
   the first hop Proxy does not either: understand location, or does 
   not know where the appropriate ERC is to route the message to.  In 
   either case, that Proxy forwards the message to another Proxy for 
   proper message routing ([11] talks to how this occurs).

      Figure 4B. UA-PROXY with Location in INVITE

   In message flows similar to 4A and/or 4B, the Record-Route header 
   could be added by the proxies, this is OPTIONAL in usage and left to
   other documents to refine.  

   In the case of an identifiable emergency call, something that cannot
   happen is for any Proxy to Challenge [per 1] the INVITE message.  In
   fact, while usage of the SIPS URI is encouraged and SHOULD be used, 
   it MUST NOT be mandatory for successful message routing.  If the 
   first SIPS INVITE fails for security property reasons, the second 
   attempt by Alice (in these examples) MUST be allowed to be in the 
   clear, not challenged, and routed properly.  Security mechanisms 
   MUST NOT fail any call attempt, and if they do once, they MUST NOT 
   be mandatory for the subsequent attempt for a successful session 
   set-up to an ERC.  The results of this are that the Proxy that 
   failed the first attempt for security reasons MUST be aware of this 
   failed attempt for the subsequent attempt that MUST process without 
   failure a second time.   It must be assumed that the INVITE in any 
   instance is considered "well formed".

9.1.1 UA-to-Proxy Routing the Message with INVITE (unsecure)

   Below can be considered the initial unsecure INVITE M1 from Figures 
   4A and 4A, or the second attempt message to an initial message that 
   was failed by a Proxy.  This version of M1 is not using any security
   measures and is using the civic format message body that is the 
   identical location to the previous example.

9.2 UA-to-Proxy Routing with UPDATE

   If the previous example of the location contained in the INVITE were 
   to account for the movement of Alice (and her UA) before the ERC 
   responded with a 200 OK, the UPDATE method is the appropriate SIP 
   Request Method to use to update the proxies and ERC personnel that 
   Alice has moved geo-locations from where she initially made her set-
   up request.  

   In this scenario (shown in the call flow of Figure 5A), Alice 
   sending the UPDATE message here may cause the Proxy to CANCEL an 
   existing pending INVITE Request, and retransmit INVITE to a NEW 
   ERC(2), for example, if she walked across a street into a new ERC 
   coverage area.  The Proxy MUST remain transaction stateful in order 
   to be aware of the 200 OK Response from ERC1.  Upon receiving the 
   UPDATE from Alice and analyzing the location provided by the message
   looking for a geographic change, either forwarding that message to 
   ERC1 if the change is still within ERC1's coverage area, or deciding
   to forward a message to another ERC covering where Alice is now 
   (ERC2 in this case) with her new location.  If the later change in 
   destinations is required, the Proxy MUST CANCEL the pending INVITE 
   to ERC1 (with a 487 "terminated request" being the specified 
   response).


Polk & Rosen                                                  [Page 36]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004


   SIPS MUST be used by Alice initially.  Upon any failure of the 
   initial Request, Alice's UA can decide to send the new message 
   without SIPS.

   Alice moves locations (with her UA detecting the movement), causing 
   her UA to generate an UPDATE message ([M5] of Figure 3) prior to her
   UA receiving a final response from the ERC.  In this case, Alice has
   walked across the South Wacker Drive to another building.  Here is

9.2.2 UA-to-Proxy Routing the Message with UPDATE (unsecure)

   left blank for now


10.  Meeting RFC3693 Requirements

   Section 7.2 of [7] details the requirements of a "using protocol". 
   They are:

   Req. 4.  The using protocol has to obey the privacy and security
      instructions coded in the Location Object and in the 
      corresponding Rules regarding the transmission and storage of the
      LO.

   This document requires, in Section 7, that SIP entities sending or 
   receiving location MUST obey such instructions.

   Req. 5.  The using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys 
      associated with the credentials are transported to the respective
      parties, that is, key establishment is the responsibility of the 
      using protocol.

   [1] and the documents it references define the key establish 
   mechanisms.


Polk & Rosen                                                  [Page 40]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004


   Req. 6.  (Single Message Transfer)  In particular, for tracking of 
      small target devices, the design should allow a single 
      message/packet transmission of location as a complete 
      transaction.

   This document specifies that the LO be contained in the body of a 
   single message.


11. Current Known Open issues

   This is a list of open issues that have not yet been addressed to 
   conclusion:

   1) Whether SIP Proxies SHOULD be able to insert location information
      into an emergency call set-up (the INVITE)?

      1a) This has the additional implication of whether or not, or 
          regardless of the fact the UAC already inserted location into
          the sos@homedomain INVITE.

      1b) Should the Proxy somehow differentiate its location 
          information from that provided by the UAC (with each LI 
          having a SIP entity (type?) originator label?

      1c) Should there be any behavior difference with respect to Open 
          Issue #1b if the Proxy does not know or cannot tell if the 
          UAC inserted location information (further emphasizing the 
          need for some form of originator label)?

   2) Whether SIP Proxies SHOULD be able to return location information
      in a Redirect message to the UAC making the emergency call?


12.  New Open Issues

   These are new open issues to be addressed within this document or 
   the topics/areas dropped from consideration:

   1) How do we handle proxy authenticated location?

   2) What do we do in an Offer/Answer model where the INV contains an 
      Offer to the UAS asking which format they want to receive?

   3) What do we do with Alice wanting Bob's Location in the 200 OK (to
      her INVITE with location)?

   4) What about a new 4XX error for unknown or bad location given?

   5) There is the case in the Proxy Routing in which a UAC sent an 
      INVITE to sos@ without a location message body. Does this 


Polk & Rosen                                                  [Page 41]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

      necessitate the need for a 4XX level error informing the UAC to 
      "retry with the location message body included this time"?

      Another spin on this is if the UAC doesn't know it's location and
      wants to ask a Proxy server to include the UAC's location if it 
      is known to the Proxy...

   6) How or should we get into a Redirect message from a PS that 
      contains a Location body for that UAC? Should we RECOMMEND a UAC 
      that receives a 3XX Reply to an INVITE that contains a Location 
      body with a presence line signifying the UAC, the UAC MUST 
      include that Location body in the new INVITE?

      6a) What if the UAC already sent a Location body in the original 
          message, should it replace the location body with what the PS
          included, or include both?

         6ai) If we state "both", which we agreed in the past is a good 
              idea, I see no way in the PIDF-LO or in MIME to denote 
              which message body came from Alice and which came from 
              the PS...

   7) The authors failed to get this document reclassified into a 
      specification effort (from a requirements ID effort)

      7a) will re-request to the ADs after IETF60 for this

   8) Req U-PS7 (Proxy Assertion of a Location body) is not addressable
      yet in SIP (as Identity is barely addressable).

      8a) Should this requirement remain as a goal?

   9) From section 9.2 (Emergency call with an updated location), if 
      Alice does venture into another coverage area, how does her new 
      UPDATE with new location get sent to a second (and now 
      appropriate) ERC(2)? 

      The pending INVITE needs to be cancelled or able to be 
      sequentially forked (which not all Proxies will be able to do). 
      Without that occurring, the new UPDATE will not cause a new 
      INVITE to be originated from the Proxy towards ERC2... and what 
      happens to the UPDATE message (which cannot be an original 
      request into ERC2)?


13.  Security Considerations

   Conveyance of geo-location of a UAC is problematic for many reasons.
   This document calls for that conveyance to normally be accomplished 
   through secure message body means (like S/MIME or TLS).  In cases 
   where a session set-up is routed based on the location of the UAC 
   initiating the session or SIP MESSAGE, securing the location with an


Polk & Rosen                                                  [Page 42]
Internet Draft              SIP Location Reqs           July 19th, 2004

   end-to-end mechanism such as S/MIME is problematic.  


14.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA considerations within this document at this time.
