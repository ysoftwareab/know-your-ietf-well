  Abstract  
     
    The VPWS service [L2VPN Framework] provides point-to-point 
    connections between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does 
    so by binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device 
    with a Provider Edge, PE, device) to a Pseudowire (connecting the 
    two PEs).  In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of the same 
    technology (e.g., both ethernet, both ATM), and the Pseudowire must 
    carry the frames of that technology.  However, if it is known that 
    the frames' payload consists solely of IP datagrams, it is possible 
    to provide a point-to-point connection in which the Pseudowire 
    connects Attachment Circuits of different technologies.  This 
    requires the PEs to perform a function known as "ARP Mediation".  
    This document specifies the ARP Mediation function, and specifies 
                 draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-00.txt 
  
    the encapsulation used to carry the IP datagrams on the Pseudowires 
    when ARP mediation is used.

    1.0 Introduction 
     
    Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN) are constructed with the 
    use of a Service Provider IP backbone but are presented to the 
    Customer Edge (CE) devices as Layer 2 networks.  In theory, L2VPNs 
    can carry any Layer 3 protocol, but in many cases, the only Layer 3 
    protocol is IP.  Thus it makes sense to consider procedures that 
    are either optimized for IP or are outright dedicated to IP traffic 
    only. 
     
    In a typical implementation, illustrated in the diagram below, the 
    CE devices are connected to the Provider Edge (PE) devices via 
    Attachment Circuits (AC).  The ACs are Layer 2 links.  In a pure 
    L2VPN, if traffic sent from CE1 via AC1 reaches CE2 via AC2, both 
    ACs would have to be of the same type (i.e., both ethernet, both 
    FR, etc.). However, if it is known that only IP traffic will be 
    carried, the ACs can be of different technologies, provided that

    the PEs provide the appropriate procedures to allow the proper 
    transfer of IP packets.

    A CE, which is connected via a given type of AC, may use an IP 
    Address Resolution procedure that is specific to that type of AC.  
    For example, an ethernet-attached CE would use ARP, a FR-attached 
    CE might use Inverse ARP.  If we are to allow the two CEs to have a 
    layer 2 connection between them, even though each AC uses a 
    different layer 2 technology, the PEs must intercept and "mediate" 
    the technology-specific address resolution procedures. 
     
    In this draft, we specify the procedures which the PEs must 
    implement in order to mediate the IP address resolution mechanism.  
    We call these procedures "ARP Mediation".  
     
    Consider a Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) constructed between 
    CE1 and CE2 in the diagram above.  If AC1 and AC2 are of different 
    technologies, e.g. AC1 is Ethernet and AC2 is Frame Relay (FR), 
    then ARP requests coming from CE1 cannot be passed transparently to 
    CE2.  PE1 must interpret the meaning of the ARP requests and 
    mediate the necessary information with PE2 before responding. 
     
    2.0 ARP Mediation (AM) function 
     
    The ARP Mediation (AM) function is an element of a PE node 
    operation that deals with the IP address resolution for CE devices 
    connected via a L2VPN. By placing this function in the PE node, ARP 
    Mediation can be made completely transparent to the CE devices. 
           
    For a given point-to-point connection between a pair of CEs, a PE 
    must perform three logical steps as part of the ARP Mediation 
    procedure: 
         
      1. Discover the IP addresses of the locally attached CE device 
      2. Distribute those IP Addresses to the remote PE 
      3. Notify the locally attached CE of the remote CE's IP address.

    This information is gathered using the mechanisms described in the 
    following sections.  
     
    3.0 IP Layer 2 Interworking Circuits 
     
    The IP Layer 2 Interworking Circuits refer to Pseudowires that 
    carry IP datagram as the payload.  At ingress, data link header of 
    an IP frame is removed and dispatched over the Pseudowire with or 
    without the optional control word. At the egress, PE encapsulates 
    the IP packet with the data link header used on the local 
    Attachment Circuit. 
     
    The use of this encapsulation is determined by the exchange of 
    value 0x000B as the VC type during Pseudowire establishment as 
    described in [PWE3-Control]. 
     
    4.0 Discovery of IP Addresses of Locally Attached CE Device 
     
    An IP Layer 2 Interworking Circuit enters monitoring state right 
    after the configuration. During this state it performs two 
    functions. 
       . Discovery of locally attached CE IP device 
       . Establishment of the PW 
     
    The establishment of PW occurs independently from local CE IP 
    address discovery. During the period when (bi-directional) PW has 
    been established but local CE IP device has not been detected, only 
    datagrams inside of broadcast/multicast frames are propagated; IP 
    datagrams inside unicast frames are dropped. The IP datagrams from 
    unicast frames flow only when IP end systems on both Attachment 
    Circuits have been discovered, notified and proxy functions have 
    completed. 
     
    4.1 Monitoring Local Traffic 
     
    The PE devices may learn the IP addresses of the locally attached 
    CEs from any IP traffic, such as local multicast (e.g. 224.x.x.x) 
    packets, that CE may generate irrespective of reacting to specific 
    address resolution queries described below. 
     
    4.2 CE Devices Using ARP 
     
    If a CE device uses ARP to determine the IP address of its 
    neighbor, the PE processes the ARP requests for the stated locally 
    attached circuit and responds with ARP replies containing the 
    remote CE's IP address, if the address is known. If the PE does not 
    yet have the remote CE's IP address, it does not respond, but notes 
    the IP address of the local CE and the circuit information, 
   
 Shah, et. al.             Expires April 2004                         4 
                 draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-03.txt 
  
    including related MAC address. Subsequently, when the IP address of 
    the remote CE becomes available, the PE may initiate the ARP 
    response as a means to notify the local CE, the IP address of the 
    remote CE. 
     
    This is a typical operation for Ethernet attachment circuits. It is 
    important to note that IP L2 Interworking circuit function is 
    restricted to only one end station per Ethernet Attachment Circuit. 
     
    The PE may periodically generate ARP request messages to the CE's 
    IP address as a means to verify the continued existence of the 
    address and its binding to the stated MAC address. The absence of a 
    response from the CE device for a given number of retries could be 
    used as a cause for a withdrawal of the IP address advertisement to 
    the remote PE and entering into the address resolution phase to 
    rediscover the attached CE's IP address. Note that such "heartbeat" 
    scheme is needed only for broadcast links, as a loss of CE may 
    otherwise be undetectable. 
     
    4.3 CE Devices Using Inverse ARP 
     
    If a CE device uses Inverse ARP to determine the IP address of its 
    neighbor, the attached PE processes the Inverse ARP request for 
    stated circuit and responds with an Inverse ARP reply containing 
    the remote CE's IP address, if the address is known. If the PE does 
    not yet have the remote CE's IP address, it does not respond, but 
    notes the IP address of the local CE and the circuit information. 
    Subsequently, when the IP address of the remote CE becomes 
    available, the PE may initiate the Inverse ARP request as a means 
    to notify the local CE, the IP address of the remote CE. 
     
    This is a typical operation for Frame Relay and ATM attachment 
    circuits. In the cases where the CE does not use Inverse ARP, PE 
    could still discover the CE as described in section 4.1 and 4.5.  
     
    4.4 CE Devices Using PPP 
     
    If a CE device uses PPP to determine the IP address of its 
    neighbor, a PE takes part in the IPCP [PPP-IPCP] exchange and 
    supplies the IP address of the remote CE if the address is known. 
    If the PE does not have the remote CE's IP address, it does not 
    respond to the local CE's IPCP request but simply notes its IP 
    address. Subsequently, when the IP address of the remote CE becomes 
    available, the PE generates IPCP Configure-Request to the local CE. 
         
    The PE must deny configurations such as header compression and 
    encryptions in the NCP packets with such options.

                 draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-03.txt 
  
    4.5 Proactive method 
     
    In order to learn the IP address of the CE device for a given 
    Attachment Circuit, the PE device may execute Router Discovery 
    Protocol [RFC 1256] whereby a Router Discovery Request (ICMP û 
    router solicitation) message is sent using a source IP address of 
    zero. The IP address of the CE device is extracted from the Router 
    Discovery Response (ICMP û router advertisement) message from the 
    CE.  
     
    The use of the router discovery mechanism by the PE is optional. 
     
    5.0 IP Address Distribution Between PE 
     
    5.1 When To Distribute IP Address  
     
    A PE device advertises the IP address of the attached CE only when 
    the encapsulation type of the Pseudowire is IP L2 interworking. It 
    is quite possible that the IP address of a CE device is not 
    available at the time the PW labels are advertised. For example, in 
    Frame Relay the CE device dispatches inverse ARP request only when 
    the DLCI is active; if the PE signals the DLCI to be active only 
    when it has received the IP address along with the VC-FEC from the 
    remote PE, a chicken and egg situation arises. In order to avoid 
    such problems, the PE must be prepared to advertise the VC-FEC 
    before the CE's IP address is known. When the IP address of the CE 
    device does become available, the PE re-advertises the VC-FEC along 
    with the IP.  
     
    Similarly, if the PE detects invalidation of the CE's IP address 
    (by methods described above) the PE must re-advertise the VC-FEC 
    with null IP address to denote the withdrawal of the CE's IP 
    address. The receiving PE then waits for the notification of remote 
    IP address. During this period, propagation of unicast IP traffic 
    is suspended while continuing to let multicast IP traffic flow. 
      
    If two CE devices are locally attached to the PE where, one CE is 
    connected to an Ethernet data link and the other to a Frame Relay 
    interface, for example, the IP addresses are learned in the same 
    manner described above. However, since the CE devices are local, 
    the distribution of IP addresses for these CE devices is a local 
    step. 
     
    5.2 LDP Based Distribution 
     
    The [PWE3-CONTROL] uses Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) transport 
    to exchange VC-FEC in the Label Mapping message in a downstream 
    unsolicited mode. The VC-FEC comes in two flavors; Pwid and 
    Generalized ID FEC elements and shares some fields that are common 
   
 Shah, et. al.             Expires April 2004                         6 
                 draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-03.txt 
  
    between them. The discussions below refer to these common fields 
    for IP L2 Interworking Circuits.  
     
    The IP L2 Interworking uses IP datagram as payload over the 
    Pseduowire. The use of such encapsulation is identified by VC type 
    field of the VC-FEC as the value 0x000B [PWE3-Control].  
         
    In addition, this document defines an IP address TLV that must be 
    included in the optional TLV field of the Label Mapping message 
    when advertising VC-FEC for the IP L2 Interworking Circuit. Such 
    use of optional TLV in the Label Mapping message to extend the 
    attributes of the VC-FEC has also been specified in the [PWE3-
    Control].  
     
    When processing a received VC-FEC, the PE matches the VC-Id and VC-
    type with the locally configured VC-Id to determine if the VC-FEC 
    is of type IP L2 Interworking. If matched, it further checks the 
    presence of IP address TLV. If an IP address TLV is absent, a Label 
    Release message is issued to reject the PW establishment.  
     
         
       0                   1                   2                   3  
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
      |1|0|  IP address TLV (TBD)     |           Length              |

      |                         IP Address                            |  
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
         
        
         
    The Length field is defined as the length of the IP address and is 
    set to value 4. 
     
    The IP address field is set to value null to denote that 
    advertising PE has not learned the IP address of his local CE 
    device. The non-zero value of the IP address field denotes IP 
    address of advertising PEÆs attached CE device.  
     
    The IP address TLV is also used in the LDP notification message 
    along with the VC-FEC. The IP address TLV in Notification message 
    is used as an update mechanism to notify the changes in the IP 
    address of the local CE device as described in [SHAH-CONTROL]. 
     
    5.3 Out-of-band Distribution, Manual Configuration 
     
    In some cases, it may not be possible to deduce the IP addresses 
    from the VPN traffic nor induce remote PEs to supply the necessary 
    information on demand.  For those cases, out-of-band methods, such 
    as manual configuration, could be used.  The use of these types of 
    methods is useful only to handle corner cases.

    5.4 Single sided ARP mediation 
     
    In this configuration, one PE device treats the Pseudowire as a 
    homogeneous circuit, while the other PE device treats it as a 
    heterogenous circuit. For example, if PE1 is connected to an 
    Ethernet Attachment Circuit and PE2 is connected to an ATM 
    Attachment Circuit, PE1 and PE2 would both treat the Pseudowire as 
    of type Ethernet.  From PE1's point of view, the circuit is 
    homogeneous, since the Attachment Circuit and the Pseudowire are 
    both Ethernet. Hence PE1 does no ARP mediation. From PE2's point of 
    view, the circuit is heterogeneous, so PE2 performs ARP mediation.  
    That is,  
     
            o PE2 signals to PE1 that the PW Type is Ethernet, 
            o PE2 learns the IP address of remote CE from Ethernet 
              frames received over the PW, 
            o PE2 learns the IP address of locally attached ATM CE, 
            o PE2 proxies the IP address of each CE to the other,  
            o PE2 decapsulates the ATM data link header and 
              reencapsulates with an Ethernet header before forwarding 
              the IP data frames from its local CE over the PW.  The 
              information used to build the Ethernet data link header 
              is obtained through ARP mediation functions.  Similar 
              header manipulation is performed when Ethernet IP frames 
              are forwarded to ATM Attachment Circuit, 
            o Drop all non IP Ethernet frames received over Ethernet 
              PW. 
     
    In summary, single sided configuration handles ARP mediation as PE 
    would typically when managing two locally attached heterogenous 
    Attachment Circuits. 
     
    6.0 How CE Learns The Remote CE's IP address  
         
    Once the PE has received the remote CE's IP address information 
    from the remote PE, it will either initiate an address resolution 
    request or respond to an outstanding request from the attached CE

    When the PE learns the remote CE's IP address as described in 
    section 5.1 and 5.2, it may or may not know the local CE's IP 
    address. If the local CE's IP address is not known, the PE must 
    wait until it is acquired through one of the methods described in 
    sections 4.1, 4.3 and 4.5. If the IP address of the local CE is 
    known, the PE may choose to generate an unsolicited ARP message to 
    notify the local CE about the binding of the remote CE's IP address 
    with the PE's own MAC address.

    When the local CE generates an ARP request, the PE must proxy the 
    ARP response using its own MAC address as the source hardware 
    address and remote CE's IP address as the source protocol address. 
    The PE must respond only to those ARP requests whose destination 
    protocol address matches the remote CE's IP address. 
     
    6.2 CE Devices Using Inverse ARP 
         
    When the PE learns the remote CE's IP address, it should generate 
    an Inverse ARP request. In case, the local circuit requires 
    activation e.g. Frame Relay, PE should activate it first before 
    sending Inverse ARP request. It should be noted, that PE might 
    never receive the response to its own request, nor see any CE's 
    Inverse ARP request in cases where CE is pre-configured with remote 
    CE IP address or the use of Inverse ARP is not enabled. In either 
    case CE has used other means to learn the IP address of his 
    neighbor. 
     
    6.3 CE Devices Using PPP 
         
    When the PE learns the remote CE's IP address, it must initiate the 
    Configure-Request using the remote CE's IP address or respond to 
    pending Configure-Request from the local CE. As noted earlier, all 
    other configuration options related to compression, encryptions, 
    etc., should be rejected. 
       
    7.0 Use of IGPs with IP L2 Interworking L2VPNs  
     
    In an IP L2 interworking L2VPN, when an IGP on a CE connected to a 
    broadcast link is cross-connected with an IGP on a CE connected to 
    a point-to-point link, there are routing protocol related issues 
    that must be addressed. The link state routing protocols are 
    cognizant of the underlying link characteristics and behave 
    accordingly when establishing neighbor adjacencies, representing 
    the network topology, and passing protocol packets. 
     
    7.1 OSPF  
         
    The OSPF protocol treats broadcast link type with a special 
    procedure that engages in neighbor discovery to elect a designated 
    and a backup designated router (DR and BDR respectively) with which 
    it forms adjacencies. However, these procedures are neither 
    applicable nor understood by OSPF running on a point-to-point link. 
    By cross-connecting two neighbors with disparate link types, an IP 
    L2 interworking L2VPN has the potential to experience connectivity 
    issues. 
     
   
 Shah, et. al.             Expires April 2004                         9 
                 draft-shah-l2vpn-arp-mediation-03.txt 
  
    Additionally, the link type specified in the router LSA will not 
    match for two routers that are supposedly sharing the same link 
    type. Finally, each OSPF router generates network LSAs when 
    connected to a broadcast link such as Ethernet, receipt of which by 
    an OSPF router on the point-to-point link further adds to the 
    confusion. 
         
    Fortunately, the OSPF protocol provides a configuration option 
    (ospfIfType), whereby OSPF will treat the underlying physical 
    broadcast link as a point-to-point link. 
         
    It is strongly recommended that all OSPF protocols on CE devices 
    connected to Ethernet interfaces use this configuration option when 
    attached to a PE that is participating in an IP L2 Interworking 
    VPN. 
     
    7.2 IS-IS  
         
    The IS-IS protocol sends a LAN Hello PDU (IIH packet) with the MAC 
    address and the IP address of the intermediate system (i.e., CE 
    device) when attached to Ethernet links. The CE device expects its 
    neighbor to insert its own MAC and IP address in the response. If 
    the neighbor is connected via a point-to-point link type, the LAN 
    Hello PDU will be silently discarded. Similarly, Hello PDUs on the 
    point-to-point link do not contain any MAC address, which will 
    confuse a neighbor on an Ethernet link, if these two neighbors were 
    cross-connected via above described mechanisms. 
         
    Thus, use of the IS-IS protocol on CE devices presents problems 
    when interconnected by disparate data link types in an IP L2 
    Interworking VPN environment.  There are some mechanisms defined in 
    draft-ietf-isis-igp-p2p-over-lan-00.txt to accommodate point-to-
    point behavior over broadcast networks. The feasibility of such 
    techniques to solve this problem is under review. 
         
    It is important to note that the use of the IS-IS protocol in 
    enterprise networks (i.e., CE routers) is less common. The IS-IS 
    related difficulties for IP L2 Interworking VPNs, hence are 
    minimized. 
     
    7.3 RIP  
         
    RIP protocol broadcasts RIP advertisements every 30 seconds. If the 
    group/broadcast address snooping mechanism is used as described 
    above, the attached PE can learn the advertising (CE) router's IP 
    address from the IP header of the advertisement. No special 
    configuration is required for RIP in this type of Layer 2 IP 
    Interworking L2VPN.
