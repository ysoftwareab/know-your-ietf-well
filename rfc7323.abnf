tc=1   <A, TSval=1> ------------------->

tc=2   (lost) <---- <ACK(A), TSecr=1, win=n>
                (RTTM would have been 1)

                   (receive window opens, window update is sent)
tc=5        <---- <ACK(A), TSecr=1, win=m>
                   (RTTM is calculated at 4)

ExpectedSamples = ceiling(FlightSize / (SMSS * 2))
