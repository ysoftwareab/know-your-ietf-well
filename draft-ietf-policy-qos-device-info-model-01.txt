 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

 Abstract 

   The purpose of this draft is to define an information model that 
   describes the QoS mechanisms inherent in different network 
   devices. Broadly speaking, these mechanisms describe the 
   attributes common to selecting and conditioning traffic through 
   the forwarding path of network devices running Differentiated 
   Services (see [R2475]). The next version of this draft will also 
   address Integrated Services (see [R1633]). 

   This draft is intended to be used with the QoS Policy Information 
   Model [QOSPIM] to model how policies can be defined to manage and 
   configure the QoS mechanisms (e.g., the classification, marking, 
   metering, dropping, queuing, and scheduling functionality) of 
   devices. Together, these two drafts describe how to write QoS 
   policy rules to configure and manage the QoS mechanisms of 
   devices. 

   This draft, as well as [QOSPIM], are information models. That is, 
   they represent information independent of binding to a specific 
   type of repository. A separate draft will be written to provide a 
   mapping of the data contained in this document to a form suitable 
   for implementation in a directory that uses (L)DAP as its access 
   protocol. This latter draft is analogous to [QOSSCH], which 
   provides a similar mapping of the data in [QOSPIM] to a 
   directory. Together, these drafts (information models and schema 
   mappings) then describe how to write QoS policy rules that can be 
   used to store information in directories to configure device QoS 
   mechanisms.

 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 


 1. Introduction 

   The purpose of this draft is to define an information model that 
   describes the QoS mechanisms inherent in different network 
   devices. Broadly speaking, these mechanisms describe the 
   attributes common to selecting and conditioning traffic through 
   the forwarding path of network devices running Differentiated 
   Services (see [R2475]). The next version of this draft will also 
   address Integrated Services (see [R1633]). 

   This draft is intended to be used with the QoS Policy Information 
   Model [QOSPIM] to model how policies can be defined to manage and 
   configure the QoS mechanisms (e.g., the classification, marking, 
   metering, dropping, queuing, and scheduling functionality) of 
   devices. Together, these two drafts describe how to write QoS 
   policy rules to configure and manage the QoS mechanisms of 
   devices. 

   This draft, as well as [QOSPIM], are information models. That is, 
   they represent information independent of binding to a specific 
   type of repository. A separate draft will be written to provide a 
   mapping of the data contained in this document to a form suitable 
   for implementation in a directory that uses (L)DAP as its access 
   protocol. This latter draft is analogous to [QOSSCH], which 
   provides a similar mapping of the data in [QOSPIM] to a 
   directory. Together, these drafts (information models and schema 
   mappings) then describe how to write QoS policy rules that can be 
   used to store information in directories to configure device QoS 
   mechanisms. 

   The approach taken in this draft enables a common set of 
   attributes to be defined that can be used to model Differentiated 
   Services QoS.  (Integrated Services will be modeled in the next 
   release of this Draft.) Vendors can then map these attributes, 
   either directly or using a proxy agent like a PIB, to their own 
   device-specific implementations. 

   This draft explicitly separates the concepts of configuration and 
   state. Configuration attributes are used to describe the desired 
   state of the device, whereas state attributes reflect the current 
   operation of the device. Both state as well as configuration 
   attributes are necessary in order to model and manage QoS at the 
   device level. Although configuration is discussed, the draft only 
   models state attributes at this time. Configuration will be added 
   in a future draft. 

   The design of the class and relationship hierarchies described in 
   this draft is influenced from the DMTF Network information model 
   [CIM]. It is specifically not derived from the Policy Core 
   information model [PCIM].  This is because the modeling of the 
   QoS mechanisms of a device is separate and distinct from the 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 5] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   modeling of policies that manage those mechanisms. Hence, there 
   is a need to separate QoS mechanisms (this draft) from their 
   control (specified using the generic policy draft [PCIM] 
   augmented by the QoS Policy draft [QOSPIM]). 

 1.1. Policy Management Conceptual Model 

   The [PCIM] describes a general methodology for constructing 
   policy rules. A policy rule aggregates a set of policy conditions 
   and policy actions. The semantics of a policy rule are such that 
   if the set of conditions evaluates to TRUE, then the set of 
   actions are executed. 

   Policy conditions and actions have two principle components, 
   operands and operators.  Operands can be constants or variables. 
   A policy can not be constructed without specifying the operands 
   to be examined, the operands to be changed, and how they should 
   be bound together.  

   Operands can be specified at a high-level, such as Joe (a user) 
   or Gold (a service). Operands can also be specified at a much 
   finer level of detail, one that is much closer to the operation 
   of the device. Examples of the latter include an IP Address or a 
   queue's bandwidth allocation. Implicit in the use of operands is 
   the binding of legal values or ranges of values to an operand. 
   For example, the value of an IP address cannot be an integer. 
   These concepts are defined in this draft and in [QOSPIM].  

   The second component of policy conditions and actions is a set of 
   operators.  Operators can express both relationships (greater 
   than, member of a set, Boolean OR, etc.) as well as assignments.  
   Together, operators and operands can express a variety of 
   conditions and actions, such as: 

         If Bob is an Engineer... 
         If the source IP address is in the Marketing Subnet... 
         Set Joe's IP address to 2.3.4.5 
         Limit the bandwidth of application x to 10 Mb 
      
   We recognize that the definition of operator semantics is 
   critical to the definition of policies.  However, the definition 
   of these operators is beyond the scope of this document.  Rather, 
   this draft (with [QOSPIM]) takes the first steps in identifying 
   and standardizing a set of attributes (operands) for use in 
   policies. 

 1.2. Purpose and Relation to Other Policy Work 

   This model establishes a canonical model of the QoS mechanisms of 
   a network device (e.g., router or switch) that is independent of 
   any specific type of network device. This enables traffic to be 



 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 6] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   described using a common set of abstractions, modeled as a set of 
   services and sub-services. 

   When the concepts of this draft are used in conjunction with the 
   concepts of [QOSPIM], then one is able to define policies that 
   bind the services in a network to the needs of applications using 
   that network. In other words, the business requirements of an 
   organization can be reflected in one set of policies, and those 
   policies can be translated to a lower-level set of policies that 
   control and manage the configuration and operation of network 
   devices. 

 1.3. Typical Examples of Policy Usage 

   Policies could be implemented as low-level rules using the 
   information model described in this specification. For example, 
   in a low-level policy, a condition could be represented as an 
   evaluation of a specific attribute from this model. Therefore, a 
   condition such as "If filter = HTTP" would be interpreted as a 
   test determining whether any HTTP filters have been defined for 
   the device. A high-level policy, such as "If HTTP, Then mark with 
   DSCP 24", would be expressed as a series of actions in a low-
   level policy using the classes and attributes described below: 

   1. Create HTTP filter 
   2. Create DSCP marker with the value of 24 
   3. Bind the HTTP filter to the DSCP marker 
  
   Using this approach to representing policies, all the semantics 
   of the policy are preserved.  


 2. Approach 

   QoS activities in the IETF have mainly focused in two areas, 
   Integrated Services (IntServ) and Differentiated Services 
   (DiffServ) (see [POLTERM], [R1633] and [R2475]). This version of 
   this draft focuses on the specification of QoS attributes and 
   classes for the policy management of Differentiated Services. 
   However, the framework defined by the structure of the classes 
   defined in this document has been designed with the needs of 
   IntServ in mind. 

 2.1. Common Needs Of DiffServ and IntServ 

   First, let us consider IntServ. IntServ has two principle 
   components. One component is embedded in the forwarding engine of 
   the networking device. Its functions include the classification 
   and policing of individual flows and scheduling admitted packets 
   for the outbound link. The other component of IntServ is the 
   management of the signaling protocol (e.g., the PATH and RESV 
   messages of RSVP). This component processes reservation requests, 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 7] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   manages bandwidth, outsources decision making to policy servers, 
   and interacts with the Routing Table manager.  

   We will take RSVP into consideration when defining the structure 
   of this information model. As this draft initially focuses on the 
   forwarding engine, elements of RSVP applicable to the forwarding 
   engine will be considered in the structure of the classes. 

   This draft models a small subset of the QoS policy problem in 
   hopes of constructing a methodology that can be adapted for other 
   aspects of QoS in particular, and policy construction in general. 
   The focus in this iteration of the draft is on QoS as applied to 
   DiffServ. 

   DiffServ operates exclusively in the forwarding engine. It has 
   all of the same components of the IntServ forwarding engine with 
   two major differences. First, DiffServ performs classification 
   based solely on the DSCP field, whereas IntServ examines a subset 
   of a standard flow's addressing 5-tuple. However, there are 
   special cases in DiffServ where the addressing 5-tuple (or other 
   parameters) can be examined. Most notably, this can occur at the 
   boundary between a DS domain and a non-DS domain. However, most 
   routers in a DiffServ domain will only need to classify based on 
   the DSCP field. 

   The second difference between IntServ and DiffServ is that the 
   signaling protocol used in IntServ (e.g., RSVP) affects the 
   forwarding engine in a more dynamic fashion. This is because each 
   newly admitted RSVP reservation requires a reconfiguration of the 
   forwarding engine. In contrast, DiffServ requires far fewer 
   changes to the forwarding engine after the PHBs have been 
   configured. 

   The approach advocated in this draft for the creation of policies 
   that control the various QoS mechanisms of networking devices is 
   to first identify the attributes with which policies are to be 
   constructed. These attributes are the parameters used in 
   expressions that are necessary to construct policies. There is 
   also a parallel desire to define the operators, relations, and 
   precedence constructs necessary to construct the conditions and 
   actions that constitute these policies. However, these efforts 
   are beyond the scope of this document. 

 2.2. Specific Needs Of DiffServ 

   DiffServ-specific rules focus on two particular areas: the core 
   and the edges of the network. As explained in the DiffServ 
   Architecture document [R2475], the edge of the network is used to 
   classify traffic into different traffic streams. The core of the 
   network then forwards traffic from different streams by using a 
   set of Per-Hop Behaviors (PHBs). The PHB is defined by a DiffServ 
   Code Point (DSCP). The DSCP is part of the IP header of each 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 8] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   packet (as described in [R2474]). This enables multiple traffic 
   streams to be aggregated into a small number of aggregated 
   traffic streams, where each aggregate traffic stream is forwarded 
   using a particular PHB.  

   The attributes used to manipulate QoS capabilities in the core of 
   the network primarily address the behavioral characteristics of 
   each supported DiffServ class (or queue). At the edges of the 
   DiffServ network, the additional complexities of flow 
   classification, policing, RSVP mappings, remarkings, and other 
   factors have to be considered. Additional modeling will be 
   required in this area.  However, first, the standards for edges 
   of the DiffServ network need more detail - to allow the edges to 
   be incorporated into the policy model. 

   This draft will initially focus on the core of the DiffServ 
   network. However, it is expected that as the DiffServ standards 
   evolve to better define the semantics of edge devices, these 
   attributes will also be added to the QoS schema presented in this 
   document. 

 2.3. Specific Needs Of IntServ 

   This first iteration of this document will focus exclusively on 
   the forwarding aspects of network QoS. Therefore, while the 
   forwarding aspects of IntServ will be considered, the management 
   of IntServ will not be considered. This will be addressed in a 
   future iteration of this draft. 


 3. Methodology 

   There is a clear need to define attributes and behavior that 
   together define how traffic should be conditioned. This draft 
   defines a set of classes and relationships that define the QoS 
   mechanisms used to condition traffic; [QOSPIM] is used to define 
   policies to control the QoS mechanisms defined in this draft. 

   However, there are some very basic issues that need to be 
   considered when combining these drafts. Considering these issues 
   should help in constructing a schema for managing the operation 
   and configuration of network QoS mechanisms through the use of 
   QoS policies. 

 3.1. Level of Abstraction for Expressing QoS Policies 

   The first issue requiring consideration is the level of 
   abstraction at which QoS policies should be expressed. If we 
   consider policies as a set of rules used to react to events and 
   manipulate attributes or generate new events, we realize that 
   policy represents a continuum of specifications that relate 
   business goals and rules to the conditioning of traffic done by a 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 9] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   device or a set of devices. An example of a business level policy 
   might be: from 1:00 pm PST to 7:00 am EST, sell off 40% of the 
   network capacity on the open market. In contrast, a device-
   specific policy might be: if the queue depth grows at a geometric 
   rate over a specified duration, trigger a potential link failure 
   event. 

   A general model for this continuum is shown in Figure 1 below. 

    +---------------------+ 
    | High-Level Business |    Not directly related to device  
    |     Policies        |    operation and configuration details 
    +---------------------+ 
              | 
              | 
    +---------V-----------+ 
    | Device-Independent  |    Translate high-level policies to 
    |       Policies      |    general device operational and  
    +---------------------+    configuration information 
              | 
              | 
    +---------V-----------+ 
    |   Device-Dependent  |    Translate generic device information  
    |       Policies      |    to specify how particular devices  
    +---------------------+    should operate and be configured 
   
                    Figure 1. The policy continuum 
   
   High-level business policies are used to express the requirements 
   of the different applications, and prioritize which applications 
   get "better" treatment when the network is congested. The goal, 
   then, is to use policies to relate the operational and 
   configuration needs of a device directly to the business rules 
   that the network administrator is trying to implement (in the 
   network that the device belongs to). 

   Device-independent policies translate business policies into a 
   set of generalized operational and configuration policies that 
   are independent of any specific device. Not only does this enable 
   different types of devices (i.e., routers, switches, firewalls, 
   and hosts) to be controlled by QoS policies, it also enables 
   devices made by different vendors that use different types of QoS 
   mechanisms to be controlled. This enables these different devices 
   to each supply the correct relative conditioning to the same type 
   of traffic. 

   In contrast, device-dependent policies translate device-
   independent policies into ones that are specific for a given 
   device. The reason that a distinction is made between device-
   independent and device-dependent policies is that in a given 
   network, many different devices having many different 
   capabilities (and hence many different mechanisms) need to be 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 10] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   controlled together. Device-independent policies provide a common 
   layer of abstraction for managing multiple devices of different 
   capabilities, while device-dependent policies implement the 
   specific conditioning that is required. This draft provides a 
   common set of abstractions for representing QoS mechanisms in a 
   device-independent way. 

   This draft is focused on the device-independent representation of 
   policies. QoS mechanisms are modeled in sufficient detail as to 
   provide a common device-independent representation of QoS 
   policies. They can also be used to provide a basis for 
   specialization, enabling each vendor to derive a set of vendor-
   specific classes that represent how traffic conditioning is done 
   for that vendor∆s set of devices. This model also contains hooks 
   to enable it to be combined with the QoS policy information model 
   as described in [QOSPIM]. 

 3.2. Specifying Policy Parameters 

   Policies are a function of parameters (attributes) and operators 
   (boolean, arithmetic, relational, etc.). Therefore, both need to 
   be defined as part of the same policy in order to correctly 
   condition the traffic. If the parameters of the policy are 
   specified too narrowly, they will reflect the individual 
   implementations of QoS in each device. As there is currently 
   little consensus in the industry on what the correct 
   implementation model for QoS is, most defined attributes would 
   only be applicable to the unique characteristics of a few 
   individual devices. Lastly, standardizing all of these potential 
   implementation alternatives would be a never-ending task as new 
   implementations appear on the market. 

   Similarly, if the parameters of the policy are specified too 
   broadly, it is impossible to develop meaningful policies. For 
   example, if we concentrate on the so-called Olympic set of 
   policies, a business policy like "Bob gets Gold Service," is 
   clearly meaningless to the large majority of existing devices. 
   This is because the device has no way of determining who Bob is 
   or what QoS mechanisms should be configured in what way to 
   provide Gold service. 

   Furthermore, Gold service may represent a single service, or it 
   may portray a set of services that are related to each other.  In 
   the latter case, these may have different conditioning 
   characteristics.  

   This draft defines a set of parameters that are fit into a 
   canonical model for modeling the elements in the forwarding path 
   of a device. By defining such a model in a device-independent 
   way, the needed parameters can be appropriately abstracted.

 3.3. Specifying Policy Services 

   Administrators want the flexibility to be able to define traffic 
   conditioning without having to have a low-level understanding of 
   the different QoS mechanisms that implement that conditioning. 
   Furthermore, administrators want the flexibility to group 
   different services together, so that the group of services as a 
   whole will receive "better" treatment than another group of 
   services. 

   These two goals dictate the need for the following set of 
   abstractions:  

      - a flexible way to describe a service 

      - must be able to group different services that may use 
       different technologies (e.g., DiffServ and 802.1P) together 

      - must be able to define a set of sub-services that together 
       make up a higher-level service 

      - must be able to associate a service and the set of QoS 
       mechanisms that are used to condition that service 

      - must be able to define policies that manage the QoS 
       mechanisms used to implement a service. 

   This draft addresses this set of problems by defining a set of 
   classes and relationships that can abstract concepts like "Gold 
   Service" and bind them to a specific set of QoS mechanisms that 
   are used to implement the conditioning required by Gold Service. 
   Furthermore, this draft defines the concept of "sub-services" to 
   enable Gold Service to be defined as a single service or a set of 
   services that together should be treated as an atomic entity. 

   Given these abstractions, policies (as defined in [QOSPIM]) can 
   be written to control the QoS mechanisms and services defined in 
   this draft. 

 3.4. Level of Abstraction for Defining QoS Attributes and Classes 

   This draft will standardize a set of classes and attributes that 
   are needed to support policies that configure device QoS 
   mechanisms. This iteration of this draft concentrates on the 
   representation of DiffServ services; the next iteration will 
   include IntServ services. 

   The classes and attributes in this draft are intended to be used 
   in conjunction with the QoS policy classes and attributes defined 
   in [QOSPIM]. For example, to preserve the delay characteristics 
   committed to the end-user, a network administrator may wish to 
   create policies that monitor the queue depths in a device and 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 12] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   adjust resource allocations when delay budgets are at risk 
   (perhaps as a result of a network topology change). The classes 
   and attributes in this document define the specific services and 
   mechanisms required to implement those services. The classes and 
   attributes defined in [QOSPIM] provide the overall structure of 
   the policy that manages and configures this service. 

   This combination of low-level specification (using this draft) 
   and high-level structuring (using [QOSPIM]) of network services 
   enables network administrators to define new services required of 
   the network, that are directly related to business goals, while 
   ensuring that such services can be managed. However, this goal 
   (of creating and managing service-oriented policies) can only be 
   realized if policies can be constructed that are capable of 
   supporting diverse implementations of QoS. The solution is to 
   model the QoS capabilities of devices at the behavioral level. 
   This means that for DiffServ, the model must support the 
   following characteristics: 

      - Modeling of a generic network service that has QoS 
       capabilities 

      - Modeling of how DiffServ traffic conditioning is defined 

      - Modeling of how statistics are gathered to monitor DiffServ     
       (and other types of QoS) services 

   This draft models a network service and associates it with one or 
   more QoS mechanisms that are used to implement that service. It 
   also models the various components that are used to condition 
   DiffServ traffic in a canonical form, such that standard as well 
   as custom DiffServ services may be described. It further 
   generalizes this such that other technologies, such as IntServ, 
   may use the same set of conditioning primitives. 

   Statistics will be added in the next release of this draft. 

 3.5. Characterization of QoS Attributes 

   The QoS attributes and container classes will be described in 
   more detail in section 4. However, we should consider the basic 
   characteristics of these attributes to understand the methodology 
   for representing them. 

   There are essentially two types of attributes, state and 
   configuration.  Configuration attributes describe the desired 
   state of the device, and include attributes and classes for 
   representing desired or proposed thresholds, bandwidth 
   allocations, and how to classify traffic. State attributes 
   describe the actual state of the device. This includes the 
   current ACTUAL value of these configuration attributes in 
   devices, as well as attributes that represent dynamic state 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 13] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   (queue depths, excess capacity consumption, loss rates, and so 
   forth). 

   These two types of attributes must be modeled using a common 
   information model in order for them to be able to be used 
   together. This draft makes explicit the common information model 
   for modeling state as well as configuration attributes for 
   network QoS mechanisms. In addition, it emphasizes the need to 
   separate these two types of attributes. 

   One should note that the state attributes defined in this draft 
   are purposely device-independent. In contrast, configuration 
   attributes that are defined in a future release of this draft can 
   be represented and applied to either the same set of devices or a 
   specific device. Examples of the former are setting one or more 
   attributes in all devices in the same domain that share the same 
   AS (autonomous system) number, or all core devices that share the 
   same delay bound for a specific service. Examples of the latter 
   are setting a specific set of attributes that configures how a 
   device-specific implementation of a conditioning mechanism will 
   operate. 

   This difference between state and configuration attributes 
   suggests that the schema for configuration attributes will not be 
   exactly the same as the schema that supports state attributes. 
   However, many of the attributes defined in this draft are exactly 
   the settings that will be configured. Thus, the definition of 
   these attributes provides the link between modeling the 
   operational state of a device and setting configuration 
   parameters of that device. The intersection of these two schemata 
   will be through the set of attributes, associations and 
   aggregations that relates one schema to the other. 

 3.6. Identifying Common Shared Policies 

   Another issue that arises is how to distinguish policies for 
   individual devices or even components of a device from policies 
   that apply to a set of devices. These contextual issues depend on 
   more than just the policy schema in order for them to function 
   properly. Hence, ongoing efforts to define devices, services, 
   users, groups, and collections of these objects are all relevant 
   to the proper construction of a policy model. Context is a key 
   aspect of policies that still requires a great deal more work. 
   The next iteration of this draft will include some preliminary 
   results from these modeling efforts. This will focus on using the 
   concepts in this draft, the concepts in [QOSPIM] and some new 
   concepts, to establish a better definition of the context in 
   which a policy is operating. 






 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 14] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

 3.7. QoS Information Model Derivation 

   The question of context also begs another question: how does the 
   information specified in the core and QoS policy models ([PCIM] 
   and [QOSPIM], respectively) integrate with the information 
   defined in this draft? Put another way, where should device-
   independent concepts that lead to device-specific QoS attributes 
   be derived from? 

   Past thinking was that QoS was part of the policy model. That is 
   not completely accurate, and leads to confusion. QoS is a set of 
   services that can be controlled using policy. These services are 
   represented as device mechanisms. Not all mechanisms are always 
   applicable for building a given service, and so this is further 
   abstracted by referring to the QoS capabilities of a device. 
   However, a key point is that QoS services, as well as other types 
   of services (e.g., security), are provided by the mechanisms 
   inherent in a given device. This means that all devices are 
   indeed not created equal.  For example, although two devices may 
   have the same type of mechanism (e.g., a queue), one may be a 
   simple implementation (i.e., a FIFO queue) whereas one may be 
   much more complex and robust (i.e., CBWFQ). However, both of 
   these devices can be used to deliver QoS services, and both need 
   to be controlled by policy. Thus, a device-independent policy can 
   instruct the device to queue certain traffic, and a device-
   specific policy can be used to implement the queuing of each 
   device. 

   Furthermore, policy is used to control these mechanisms, not to 
   represent them. For example, QoS services are implemented with 
   classifiers, meters, markers, droppers, queues, and schedulers. 
   Similarly, security is also a characteristic of devices, as 
   authentication and encryption capabilities represent services 
   that networked devices perform (irrespective of interactions with 
   policy servers). These security services may use some of the same 
   mechanisms that are used by QoS services, such as the concepts of 
   filters. However, they will largely require different mechanisms 
   than are used by QoS, even though they are both implemented in 
   the same device. 

   Thus, the similarity between QoS and other services is not so 
   much that they contain a few common mechanisms. Rather, they 
   model how a device implements that service. As such, the modeling 
   of QoS should be part of a networking device schema rather than a 
   policy schema. This enables the networking device schema to 
   concentrate on modeling device mechanisms and the policy schema 
   to focus on the semantics of representing the policy itself 
   (conditions, actions, operators, etc.). While this iteration of 
   this draft concentrates on defining an information model that can 
   represent DiffServ QoS services, the ultimate goal is to be able 
   to apply policies that control these services in network devices. 
   Furthermore, these two schemata (device and policy) must be 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 15] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   tightly integrated in order to enable policy to control QoS 
   services. 

 3.8. Attribute Representation 

   The last issue to be considered is the question of how attributes 
   are represented. If QoS attributes are represented as absolute 
   numbers (e.g., Class AF2 gets 2 Mbs of bandwidth), it is more 
   difficult to make them uniform across multiple ports in a device 
   or multiple devices, because of the broad variation in link 
   capacities. However, expressing attributes in relative or 
   proportional terms (e.g., Class AF2 gets 5% of the total link 
   bandwidth) makes it more difficult to express certain types of 
   conditions and actions, such as: 

       (If ConsumedBandwidth = AssignedBandwidth Then ...) 

   There are really three alternatives to address this problem: 

    o Multiple attributes can be defined to express the same value 
      in various forms. This idea has been rejected because of the 
      likelihood of inconsistencies between the attributes, along 
      with the difficulty in keeping these different attributes 
      synchronized (e.g., when one attribute changes, the others all 
      have to be updated). 

    o Multi-modal attributes can be defined to express the same 
      value, in different terms, based on the access or assignment 
      mode. This option was rejected because it significantly 
      complicates the model and is impossible to express in current 
      directory access protocols (e.g., (L)DAP). 

    o Attributes can be expressed as "absolutes", but the operators 
      in the policy schema would need to be more sophisticated. 
      Thus, to represent a percentage, division and multiplication 
      operators are required (e.g., Class AF2 gets .05 * the total 
      link bandwidth). This is the approach that has been taken in 
      this draft. 

 3.9. Mental Model 

   The mental model for constructing this schema is based on the 
   work done in the Differentiated Services working group. This 
   schema is based on information provided in the current versions 
   of the DiffServ Conceptual Model [DSMODEL], the DiffServ MIB 
   [DSMIB], the PIB [PIB], as well as the set of RFCs that 
   constitute the basic definition of DiffServ itself ([R2475], 
   [R2474], [R2597], and [R2598]). In addition, a common set of 
   terminology is available in [POLTERM]. 

   Note that this work is not yet completely aligned, as there are 
   differences between the DiffServ Conceptual Model, the DiffServ 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 16] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   MIB, the DiffServ PIB, and this draft. Work to finish aligning 
   these drafts is in progress, and will be reflected in the next 
   revision of this draft. 

   This model is built around two fundamental class hierarchies that 
   are bound together using a set of relationships. The two class 
   hierarchies derive from the QoSService and ConditioningService 
   base classes. A set of associations relate lower-level QoSService 
   subclasses to higher-level QoSServices, relate different types of 
   ConditioningServices together in processing a traffic class, and 
   relate a set of ConditioningServices to a specific QoSService. 
   This combination of relationships enables us to view the device 
   as providing a set of services that can be configured, in a 
   modular building block fashion, to construct application-specific 
   services. Thus, this document can be used to model existing and 
   future standard as well as application-specific network QoS 
   services. 

 3.9.1. The QoSService Class 

   The first of these classes, QoSService, is used to represent 
   higher-level network services that require special conditioning 
   of their traffic. QoSService has a set of subclasses that 
   represent technology-specific implementations of QoS (e.g., 
   DiffServ vs. 802.1P) as well as two relationships to the second 
   fundamental class, ConditioningService. This set of subclasses is 
   conceptualized as a set of coordinated, cooperating sub-services. 

   The QoS services can be related to each other or be implemented 
   as subservient services to each other. This enables us to define 
   Gold Service as (for example) a combination of the EF PHB to 
   implement a voice service and a set of AF PHBs to condition data 
   traffic. Furthermore, it lets us think of AF as a service that 
   requires different sub-services (e.g., a classification service, 
   a dropping  

   service, etc.) to implement it. This set of sub-services derive 
   from the ConditioningService class, and are related to the 
   QoSService class via the aggregation QoSConditioningSubServices 
   (see section 4 for class and relationship definitions). 

   This document, in its current form, identifies three subclasses 
   of QoS services: DiffServ, 802.1P, and Precedence. The purpose of 
   these subclasses is to enable administrators to manage the 
   application of QoS according to the specific technologies that 
   they are using. Thus, a network consisting of a set of DiffServ- 
   and non-DiffServ-compliant devices that each provided QoS traffic 
   conditioning would be modeled using different subclasses of 
   QoSService. However, each mechanism can be inter-related since 
   they all derive from a common base class, QoSService. 

   These concepts are depicted in Figure 2.

 3.9.2. The ConditioningService Class 

   The goal of the ConditioningService classes is to describe the 
   sequence of traffic conditioning that is applied to a given 
   traffic stream from an ingress to an egress interface. This is 
   done using a set of classes and relationships. 

   A single base class, ConditioningService, represents the 
   superclass for a set of mechanisms that condition traffic. Its 
   subclasses define device-independent conditioning primitives 
   (including classifiers, meters, markers, droppers, and queues) 
   that together implement the conditioning of traffic. This model 
   abstracts these services into a common set of modular building 
   blocks that can be used, regardless of device implementation, to 
   model the forwarding decisions internal to the device. 

   The different conditioning mechanisms need to be related to each 
   other to describe how traffic is conditioned. Several important 
   variations of how these services are related together exist: 

      - all types of ConditioningServices may not be required 

      - multiple instances of the same mechanism may be required 

      - no set order of application of each ConditioningService 
       exists 

   Therefore, this model does not dictate ordering, or a first or 
   last ConditioningService to be applied.  Instead, this model ties 
   together the various ConditioningServices that can be used using 
   the NextService association (see Section 4).  And, it allows the 
   special case of ingress and egress conditioning to be described 
   via a separate association, called ConditioningServiceOnEndpoint 
   (see section 4). 

   These concepts are depicted in Figure 3.

 3.9.3. QoS Statistics Classes 

   Various statistics classes were proposed in the previous 
   iteration of this draft. Such statistics are necessary to 
   properly instrument QoS services. However, since the core of this 
   draft has been reworked, the previous statistics classes did not 
   correspond and were removed. The next iteration of this draft 
   will add these classes back into the draft. 


 4. The Class Hierarchy 

   The following sections describe the class hierarchy of the 
   information model for modeling QoS capabilities at the device 
   level. 

 4.1. Difference Between Inheritance and Relationship Associations 

   This draft defines two different sets of associations - 
   inheritance and class relationships (such as dependencies and 
   aggregations).  Inheritance hierarchies are "the mechanism by 
   which more-specific elements incorporate the structure and 
   behavior of more-general elements." [UMLUG] The next two sections 
   describe the class relationships that are used in this draft and 
   model. 

 4.1.1. Associations 

   An association is a means of representing a dependency 
   relationship between two (or theoretically more) objects.  In CIM 
   and DEN, this type of relationship is modeled as a class 
   containing two (or more) object references.  Since the 
   association is itself a class, it can benefit from all of the 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 19] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   object-oriented abilities that other non-association classes 
   have. For example, it can contain properties and methods, and 
   inheritance can be used to refine its semantics such that it 
   represents a more specialized type of dependency. This has proven 
   to be a very useful abstraction, and will be used in this 
   document as well. 

   It is important to note that associations form a hierarchy that 
   is separate from the inheritance hierarchy. Although associations 
   are inherently bi-directional, there is nothing that prevents 
   higher order associations from being defined. However, such 
   associations are inherently more complex to define, understand 
   and use. In practice, associations higher than binary are rarely 
   used because of their greatly increased complexity and lack of 
   generality. 

   Finally, note that associations that are defined between two 
   classes do not affect the classes themselves. That is, the 
   addition or deletion of an association does not affect the 
   interface of the classes that it is connecting. 

 4.1.2. Aggregations 

   An aggregation is a strong form of an association, which usually 
   represents a "whole-part" or a "collection" relationship.  For 
   example, CIM uses an aggregation to represent the containment 
   relationship between a system and the components that make it up.  
   In this draft, all aggregations represent "whole-part" 
   relationships. 

   Note that an aggregate object is treated as an atomic unit, even 
   though it is comprised of, or collects, multiple objects. This is 
   a defining feature of an aggregation -
                                        - although the individual 
   components that make up an aggregate object have their own 
   identities, the aggregate object that is constructed from these 
   objects has its own identity and name. 

   "Whole-part" aggregations have some very interesting properties: 

      - cascaded deletion (if you delete the aggregate, you delete 
       all of its constituent components) 

      - transitivity (e.g., if Object A is-a-part-of Object B, and 
       if Object B is-a-part-of Object C, then Object A is-a-
       part-of Object C) 

      - anti-symmetricity (e.g., if Object A is-a-part-of Object B, 
       then Object B can not also be a-part-of Object A) 

   Aggregation is used to represent the physical and/or logical 
   grouping of related objects.

 4.2. The Structure of the Class Hierarchy 

   The following sections discuss the class hierarchies that will be 
   used to model the state of QoS devices and services.  A later 
   release will include configuration hierarchies.  This model is 
   influenced by [CIM], and is compatible with the Directory Enabled 
   Networks (DEN) effort. 

 4.2.1. The Class Hierarchy for Modeling State Information 

   The structure of the Class Hierarchy for managing the state of 
   Differentiated and Integrated Services is shown in Figure 4. In 
   this figure, the following definitions apply: 

      - CIMCORE: a class that is defined in the CIM Core Model 

      - CIMNET:  a class that is defined in the CIM Network Model 

   All of the remaining classes are defined in this document. Please 
   refer to [CIM] for the definitions of the classes in [CIMCORE] 
   and [CIMNET].

 4.2.2. The Class Hierarchy for Modeling Configuration Information 

   The structure of the class hierarchy for managing the 
   configuration of Differentiated and Integrated Services will be 
   presented in the next iteration of this draft. This is due to the 
   above hierarchy being changed significantly to reflect 
   participant feedback. 

 4.3. Class Definitions for the State Portion of the Model 

   This section will define the classes and attributes that make up 
   the Information Model for describing the QoS-related 
   functionality of network devices. This information is derived 
   from the CIM Network Model [CIM]. Only new classes that are

 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   presented in this draft will be defined; however, all existing 
   Network Model classes will be described briefly. The reader is 
   encouraged to look at [CIM] for further information. Associations 
   and aggregations will be defined in Section 4.3. 

 4.3.1. The Class ManagedElement 

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Core Model of 
   CIM. It is the root of the entire CIM inheritance hierarchy and 
   exists as a referenced class in some generic associations, such 
   as Dependency and MemberOfCollection.  ManagedElement's 
   properties are Caption and Description.  Both are free-form 
   strings to describe an instantiated object. Please refer to [CIM] 
   for the full definition of this class. 

 4.3.2. The Class ManagedSystemElement 

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Core Model of 
   CIM. It is the base class of the System, Physical, and Logical 
   Element class hierarchies. Any distinguishable component of a 
   System is a candidate for inclusion in this class hierarchy, 
   including physical components (e.g., chips and cards) and logical 
   components (e.g., software components, services, and other 
   objects). Please refer to [CIM] for the full definition of this 
   class. 

 4.3.3. The Class LogicalElement 

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Core Model of 
   CIM. It is a subclass of the ManagedSystemElement class, and is 
   the base class for all components of a managed System, such as 
   Files, Processes, or system capabilities in the form of Logical 
   Devices and Services. Please refer to [CIM] for the full 
   definition of this class. 

 4.3.4. The Class Service 

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Core Model of 
   CIM. It is a subclass of the LogicalElement class, and is the 
   base class for all objects which provide a "service" or 
   functionality in a System.  Note that a Service is a general-
   purpose object that is used to configure and manage the 
   implementation of functionality. Please refer to [CIM] for the 
   full definition of this class. 

 4.3.5. The Class NetworkService 

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Network Common 
   Model of CIM. It is a subclass of the Service class, and is the 
   base class rooting the network service hierarchy. Network 
   services represent generic functions that are available from the 
   network, and that condition and/or modify one or more parameters

   of the traffic being sent, such as fields in a packet's header. 
   Please refer to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.3.6. The Class ForwardingService 

   This is a concrete class that is defined in the Network Common 
   Model of CIM. It is a subclass of the NetworkService class, and 
   represents the forwarding of network traffic by receiving data 
   from one or more communication sources, and discarding it or 
   sending it via other communication sources.  The properties of 
   ForwardingService are ProtocolType and OtherProtocolType - 
   describing the type of protocol being forwarded. Please refer to 
   [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.3.7. The Class ConditioningService 

   This class is a specialization of ForwardingService, and 
   represents the ability to define how traffic is conditioned in 
   the data forwarding path of a device. The subclasses of 
   ConditioningService define the particular type of conditioning 
   that is done. Five fundamental types of functions are defined in 
   this draft. They are the services performed by a classifier, 
   meter, marker, dropper, and queue. Note that other, more 
   sophisticated, types of conditioning may be defined in future 
   iterations. 

   Two associations of ConditioningService are critical to its usage 
   in QoS - QoSConditioningSubService and NextService.  
   QoSConditioningSubService aggregates ConditioningServices into a 
   particular QoS service (such as AF) to describe the specific 
   conditioning functionality that underlies that QoS service.  
   NextService indicates the subsequent conditioning service(s) for 
   different traffic streams. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                ConditioningService 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class to define how traffic  
                           will be conditioned in the data  
                           forwarding path of a network device. 
       DERIVED FROM        ForwardingService 
       TYPE                Structural 
       PROPERTIES          Enabled 
   
 4.3.7.1. The property Enabled 

   This property is a boolean that, if TRUE, signifies that one or 
   more conditioning functions can be performed on traffic 
   encountered by the ConditioningService.

 4.3.8. The Class ClassifierService 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model. The 
   concept of a Classifier is defined in [DSMODEL]. It represents a 
   logical entity in the data forwarding path of a device, that 
   takes a single input stream and sorts into one or more output 
   streams. The sorting is done by a set of filters that select 
   packets based on the packet contents (or possibly other 
   attributes associated with the packet). Each output stream is the 
   result of matching a particular filter (or not matching any 
   filter). 

   This version of this model does not generalize the representation 
   of a classifier. Rather, it seeks to portray a classifier as 
   defined by [DSMODEL]. Thus, the principal components of a 
   classifier are its ability to use filters. The association, 
   ClassifierFilterSet, conveys this basic semantic.   

   A Classifier is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can 
   be aggregated into a QoSService (using the 
   QoSConditioningSubService association), and can use the 
   NextService association to describe the subsequent 
   ConditioningServices for different traffic streams. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                ClassifierService 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class describing how an input 
                           traffic stream is sorted into multiple  
                           output streams using one or more  
                           filters. 
       DERIVED FROM        ConditioningService 
       TYPE                Structural 
       PROPERTIES          ClassifierType, OtherClassifierType,  
                           HaveClassifiedPackets 
   
 4.3.8.1. The Property ClassifierType 

   This is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer that is used to 
   define the specific type of classifier of this instance. The 
   following types of classifiers are defined in this draft (please 
   see [DSMODEL] for a description of each one): 

      1 - Other 
      2 - Behavior Aggregate 
      3 - IPv4 Multi-Field-5 
      4 - IPv6 Multi-Field-5 
      5 - IPv4 Multi-Field-6 
      6 - IPv6 Multi-Field-6 
      7 - 802 MAC 
      8 - IEEE Priority 
      9 - IEEE VLAN

      10 - Free-form 
       
   Here, Multi-Field-5 defines a filter to match on source and 
   destination IP address, source and destination port, and IP 
   Protocol. Multi-Field-6 is the same, except that the DSCP value 
   is also matched. 

 4.3.8.2. The Property OtherClassifierType 

   This is a string attribute that defines a vendor-specific 
   description of the type of classifier. It is used when the value 
   of the ClassifierType attribute of this class is equal to 1. 

 4.3.8.3. The Property HaveClassifiedPackets 

   This is a Boolean attribute that, if TRUE, means that this 
   Classifier has already processed at least one packet. 

 4.3.9. The Class MeterService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. This class 
   represents the metering of network traffic. Metering is the 
   function of monitoring the arrival times of packets of a traffic 
   stream and determining the level of conformance of each packet 
   with respect to a pre-established traffic profile. A meter has 
   the ability to invoke different ConditioningServices for 
   conforming and non-conforming traffic. Non-conforming packets may 
   be further conditioned (e.g., dropped or queued) by routing the 
   packet to another conditioning element. Please see [DSMODEL] for 
   more information on metering. 

   This class is the base class for defining different types of 
   meters. As such, it contains common properties that all meter 
   subclasses share. It is modeled as a ConditioningService so that 
   it can be aggregated into a QoSService (using the 
   QoSConditioningSubService association) to describe that its 
   functionality underlies that QoS service.  Also, it uses a 
   subclass of the NextService association to describe the 
   subsequent ConditioningServices for conforming and non-conforming 
   traffic. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                MeterService 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class describing the  
                           monitoring of traffic with respect to a  
                           pre-established traffic profile. 
       DERIVED FROM        ConditioningService 
       TYPE                Structural 
       PROPERTIES          MeterType, OtherMeterType,  
                           ConformanceLevels

 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   Note: The MeterType property and the MeterService subclasses 
   provide similar information. The MeterType property is defined 
   for query purposes and for future expansion. It is assumed that 
   not all MeterServices will require a subclass to define them.  
   Therefore, MeterService will be instantiated directly and the 
   Type property is needed. 

 4.3.9.1. The Property MeterType 

   This attribute is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer that is 
   used to specify the particular type of meter that is being used. 
   Defined values of the enumerations are: 

      1 - Other 
      2 - Average Rate Meter 
      3 - Exponentially Weighted Moving Average Meter 
      4 - TokenBucketMeter 
       
 4.3.9.2. The Property OtherMeterType 

   This is a string attribute that defines a vendor-specific 
   description of the type of meter. It is used when the value of 
   the MeterType attribute of this class is equal to 1. 

 4.3.9.3. The Property ConformanceLevels 

   This attribute is a 16-bit unsigned integer. It indicates the 
   number of conformance levels supported by the meter.  For 
   example, when only "in-profile" or "out of profile" metering is 
   supported, ConformanceLevels is set to 2. 

 4.3.10. The Class AverageRateMeter 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It is a 
   subclass of MeterService and describes a simple meter, called an 
   Average Rate Meter. This type of meter measures the average rate 
   at which packets are submitted to it over a specified time. 
   Packets are defined as conformant if their average arrival rate 
   does not exceed the specified measuring rate of the meter. Any 
   packet that causes the specified measuring rate to be exceeded is 
   defined to be non-conforming. For more information, please see 
   [DSMODEL]. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                AverageRateMeter 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class describing traffic as  
                           either conforming or non-conforming,  
                           depending on whether the arrival of a  
                           packet causes the average arrival rate 
                           to exceed a pre-determined value or not.

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It is a 
   subclass of the MeterService class, and represents an 
   exponentially weighted moving average meter. This meter is a 
   simple IIR low-pass filter that measures the rate of incoming 
   packets over a small, fixed sampling interval. Any admitted 
   packet that pushes the average rate over a pre-defined limit is 
   defined to be non-conforming. Please see [DSMODEL] for more 
   information. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                EWMAMeter 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class describing admitted 
                           traffic as either conforming or non- 
                           conforming, depending on whether the  
                           arrival of a packet in a small fixed  
                           sampling interval causes the average  
                           arrival rate to exceed a  
                           pre-determined value or not.

 4.3.11.1. The Property AverageRate 

   This attribute is a 32-bit real number that defines the average 
   rate against which the sampled arrival rate of packets should be 
   measured. Any packet that causes the sampled rate to exceed this 
   rate is deemed non-conforming. The value is specified in kilobits 
   per second. 

 4.3.11.2. The Property DeltaInterval 

   This attribute is a 32-bit real number that defines the sampling 
   interval used to measure the arrival rate in bytes. The

   calculated rate is averaged over this interval and checked 
   against the AverageRate attribute. All packets whose computed 
   average arrival rate is less than the AverageRate are deemed 
   conforming.  

   The value is specified in microseconds. 

 4.3.11.3. The Property Gain  

   This attribute is a 32-bit real number that defines the time 
   constant (e.g., frequency response) of what is essentially a 
   simple IIR low-pass filter. 

 4.3.12. The Class TokenBucketMeter 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model. It 
   describes the metering of network traffic using a token bucket 
   meter. Two types of token bucket meters are defined using this 
   class - a simple, two parameter bucket meter, and a multi-stage 
   meter. 

   A simple token bucket usually has two parameters, an average 
   token rate and a burst size, and has two conformance levels. This 
   class also defines an excess burst size, which enables the meter 
   to have three conformance levels (basically, "conforming", 
   "partially conforming", and "non-conforming"). The difference is 
   that packets that exceed the excess burst size are deemed non-
   conforming, while packets that exceed the smaller BurstSize but 
   are less than the ExcessBurst size are deemed partially 
   conforming. Operation of these meters is described in [DSMODEL]. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                TokenBucketMeter 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class describing admitted 
                           traffic with respect to a token bucket. 
                           Either two or three levels of  
                           Conformance can be defined.

 4.3.12.2. The Property PeakRate 

   This attribute is a 32-bit real number that is used to define the 
   peak rate of the meter. The value is specified in kilobits per 
   second. 

 4.3.12.3. The Property BurstSize 

   This attribute is a 32-bit real number that is used to define the 
   maximum number of tokens available for the committed rate 
   (specified by the AverageRate property). The value is specified 
   in kilobytes. 

 4.3.12.4. The Property ExcessBurstSize 

   This attribute is a 32-bit real number that is used to define the 
   maximum number of tokens available for the peak rate (specified 
   by the PeakRate property). The value is specified in kilobytes. 

 4.3.13. The Class MarkerService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It describes 
   the marking or re-marking (e.g., setting or resetting of a 
   particular field in a packet header) of network traffic. Markers 
   may act either on unmarked packets or re-mark previously marked 
   ones. Markers are usually invoked as a result of a preceding 
   classifier match. Operation of various types of markers is 
   described in [DSMODEL]. 

   MarkerService is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can 
   be aggregated into a QoSService (using the 
   QoSConditioningSubService association) to describe that its 
   functionality underlies that QoS service.  Also, it uses the 
   NextService association to describe the subsequent 
   ConditioningServices after marking. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                MarkerService 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class defining the value of a 
                           field in a packet that is "marked" in  
                           order to control the conditioning that  
                           the packet receives.

   attribute with the value specified in the RemarkValue attribute.  
   The change will be made to unmarked packets and to remark a 
   previously marked one.  

   Otherwise, if FALSE and the field value is filled in, then NO 
   remarking will be done.  If FALSE, only unmarked packets will be 
   changed. 

 4.3.13.2. The Property RemarkType 

   This attribute is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer that 
   defines what type of remarking will be done. Values include: 

      1 - Other 
      2 - Mark ToS Byte 
      3 - Mark the DSCP 
      4 - Mark the Priority Field     
    

 4.3.13.3. The Property OtherRemarkType 

   This is a string attribute that defines a vendor-specific 
   description of the type of remarking that is done. It is used 
   when the value of the RemarkType attribute of this class is equal 
   to 1. 

 4.3.13.4. The Property RemarkValue 

   This attribute is a 16-bit unsigned integer that is the value to 
   be applied to the field specified in the RemarkType attribute.  

 4.3.14. The Class DropperService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It 
   represents the ability to drop network traffic or invoke another 
   ConditioningService for further processing of the remaining 
   traffic. This is the base class for different types of droppers.  
   Droppers are distinguished by the algorithm that they use to drop 
   traffic. Please see [DSMODEL] for more information about the 
   various types of droppers. 

   DropperService is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can 
   be aggregated into a QoSService (using the 
   QoSConditioningSubService association) to describe that its 
   functionality underlies that QoS service.  Also, it uses the

   Note: The DropperType property and the DropperService subclasses 
   provide similar information. The DropperType property is defined 
   for query purposes and to not require a subclass for all types of 
   DropperServices (for example, to describe a Head or Tail dropper 
   in today's model).  Therefore, DropperService can be instantiated 
   directly and the Type property is needed. 

 4.3.14.1. The Property DropperType 

   This is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer that defines the 
   type of dropper.  Values are: 

      1 - Other

      3 - Tail 
      4 - RED 
      5 - Weighted RED 
       
 4.3.14.2. The Property OtherDropperType 

   This string attribute is used in conjunction with the DropperType 
   attribute. When the value of DropperType is 1 (e.g., Other), then 
   the name of the type of dropper (for this instance) is defined in 
   this attribute. 

 4.3.14.3. The Property AlwaysDrop 

   This is a boolean attribute that, if TRUE, signifies that this 
   Dropper will always drop incoming packets. 

 4.3.14.4. The Property DropStartMetric 

   This property is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer that 
   defines the metric used to trigger the start of dropping packets. 
   This does NOT mean that all packets will be dropped; it does mean 
   that SOME packets will start to be dropped. The number and type 
   of packets dropped is a function of the type of algorithm used by 
   this Dropper.  

   Values are: 

      1 - Other 
      2 - Queue Threshold

 4.3.14.5. The Property DropMaintainMetric 

   This property is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer that 
   defines the metric used to determine when ALL packets will be

   Values are: 

      1 - Other 
      2 - Queue Threshold  
      3 - Arrival Rate  
  
 4.3.15. The Class REDDropperService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It describes 
   the ability to drop network traffic using a Random Early 
   Detection (RED) algorithm.  This algorithm is described in [RED]. 
   RED∆s purpose is congestion avoidance (as opposed to managing 
   congestion). Instead of waiting for the queues to fill up and 
   then dropping large numbers of packets, RED works by monitoring 
   the average queue depth. When the queue depth exceeds a minimum 
   threshold, packets are randomly discarded, asking only those 
   connections to slow down. Please see [DSMODEL] for more 
   information about a dropper. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                REDDropperService 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class used to describe  
                           Dropping using the RED algorithm (or

 4.3.15.1. The Property MinQueueThreshold 

   This is a 32-bit real number, and is used to define the minimum 
   queue length at which packets are subject to being dropped. 

 4.3.15.2. The Property MaxQueueThreshold 

   This is a 32-bit real number, and is used to define the maximum 
   queue length at which packets will always be dropped. 

 4.3.15.3. The Property StartProbability  

   This is a 32-bit real number, and is used in conjunction with the 
   StopProbability attribute to define the slope of the drop

   packets are subject to being dropped, as a function of the queue 
   length. 

   Min and max values are 0 to 100. 

 4.3.15.4. The Property StopProbability  

   This is a 32-bit real number, and is used in conjunction with the 
   StartProbability attribute to define the slope of the drop 
   probability function. The latter governs the rate at which 
   packets are subject to being dropped, as a function of the queue 
   length. 

   Min and max values are 0 to 100. 

 4.3.16. The Class WeightedREDDropperService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It describes 
   the ability to drop network traffic using a Weighted Random Early 
   Detection (WRED) algorithm. Like RED, the purpose of WRED is to 
   avoid congestion (as opposed to managing congestion). This 
   modification of the basic RED algorithm enables packets belonging 
   to different traffic classes to be dropped at different queue 
   depths. This algorithm also enables discard to be done based on 
   different information contained in the packet header, such as IP 
   Precedence, RSVP session parameters, or even on other factors not 
   directly encoded in the packet header, such as the queue depth. 
   Please see [DSMODEL] for more information about a dropper.

 4.3.16.3. The Property Weight 

   This is a 32-bit real number that representing the weighting 
   factor used to used to determine which queues get more service. 
   Min and max values are 0 to 100. 

 4.3.17. The Class QueuingService 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model. It 
   represents the ability to queue network traffic and to specify 
   the characteristics for determining long-term congestion. Please 
   see [DSMODEL] for more information about queuing functionality. 

   QueuingService is modeled as a ConditioningService so that it can 
   be aggregated into a QoSService (using the 
   QoSConditioningSubService association) to describe that its 
   functionality underlies that QoS service.  Also, it uses the

   This attribute is a 32-bit real number, and defines the degree to 
   which each actual queue depth influences the averaged (smoothed) 
   queue depth used for determining long-term congestion in RED-like 
   droppers. This attribute is specified as the percentage/weight 
   that each calculation of averaged queue depth influences the new 
   value of average depth. 

   Min and max values are 0 to 100.

 4.3.17.2. The Property TimeInterval 

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and defines the 
   number of nano-seconds between each calculation of average queue 
   depth. When this attribute is not specified, it implies that the 
   calculation is performed every time a packet departs from the 
   queue under normal operating conditions. In other words, if the 
   queue is serviced intermittently, the calculations will be 
   performed logically to simulate a consistent queue servicing 
   interval.   

 4.3.17.3. The Property GiveExcessCapacity 

   This property is a boolean attribute that, if TRUE, enables the 
   queue to be made available to other queue/scheduler instances. 
   When true, the queue can be used to hold packets from other 
   traffic classes than normally serviced. For example, assume that 
   queues for Gold, Silver and Bronze traffic classes are defined.  
   Further assume that the Silver queue is full and the others are 
   empty. If this boolean is set for the Gold and Bronze queues, 
   their capacity can be used to hold Silver traffic, as opposed to 
   dropping it. 

 4.3.18. The Class PacketSchedulingService 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model.  It 
   represents a scheduling service, which is a process that 
   determines whether a queued packet should be removed from a queue 
   and sent to an output interface. Note that output interfaces can 
   be physical network interfaces or interfaces to components 
   internal to systems, such as crossbars or backplanes. In either 
   case, if multiple queues are involved, schedulers are used to 
   provide access to the interface.  

   Each instance of a PacketSchedulingService describes a scheduler 
   from the perspective of the queue that it is servicing. One can 
   describe that different schedulers support different queues, or 
   that a scheduler supports several queues.  Please see [DSMODEL] 
   for more information about a scheduler. 

   PacketSchedulingService is modeled as a sibling service to 
   ConditioningService. Both are derived from a common root, 
   ForwardingService. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                PacketSchedulingService

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and defines the 
   number of bytes that can be delivered from a queue each cycle. 

 4.3.20.2. The Property BurstsAllowed 

   This is a boolean attribute which, if TRUE, signifies that a 
   temporary or short-term allocation of additional bandwidth in 
   addition to the amount of bandwidth allocated through the 
   BandwidthAllocation property is allowed. 

 4.3.20.3. The Property BurstAllocation 

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and specifies the 
   amount of temporary or short-term bandwidth that can be allocated 
   beyond the amount of bandwidth allocated through the 
   BandwidthAllocation property. If the maximum actual bandwidth 
   allocation were to be measured, it would be the sum of the 
   BurstAllocation and the BandwidthAllocation properties. 

 4.3.21. The Class BandwidthSchedulingService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It 
   represents a bandwidth scheduler, which is a process that 
   reserves a portion of the bandwidth of a link for each selected 
   traffic type.

 4.3.21.1. The Property BandwidthAllocation 

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and defines the 
   number of bytes that can be delivered from a queue each cycle. 

 4.3.21.2. The Property BurstsAllowed 

   This is a boolean attribute which, if TRUE, signifies that a 
   temporary or short-term allocation of additional bandwidth in 
   addition to the amount of bandwidth allocated through the 
   BandwidthAllocation property is allowed. 

 4.3.21.3. The Property BurstAllocation 

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and specifies the 
   amount of temporary or short-term bandwidth that can be allocated 
   beyond the amount of bandwidth allocated through the 
   BandwidthAllocation property. If the maximum actual bandwidth 
   allocation were to be measured, it would be the sum of the 
   BurstAllocation and the BandwidthAllocation properties. 

 4.3.21.4. The Property CanShare 

   This is a boolean attribute that, if TRUE, enables unused 
   bandwidth from the associated queue to be allocated to queues 
   that need additional resources. 

 4.3.21.5. The Property WorkConserving 

   This is a boolean attribute that, if TRUE, prevents the scheduler 
   from bursting traffic from the queue to which this instance of 
   the scheduler is associated (via SchedulerUsed). When TRUE, this 
   attribute also prevents bandwidth from other idle queues to be 
   consumed by the current queue, thereby preventing resource 
   allocations above the assigned bandwidth. 

 4.3.22. The Class RoundRobinPacketSchedulingService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It 
   represents a round robin packet scheduler, which is a process 
   that guarantees that bandwidth will be allocated fairly at the 
   packet level. With this type of scheduler, each queue is entitled 
   to equal access to the output interface.

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It

   fair packet scheduler except that a per-traffic stream multiplier 
   is applied to each stream.  

   The class definition is as follows:

 4.3.23.1. The Property WeightingFactor 

   This real 32-bit attribute is used to define the weighting factor 
   that will be used to offer some queues a higher probability of 
   being serviced than other queues. This attribute represents this 
   probability. 

 4.3.23.2. The Property Priority 

   This 16-bit unsigned integer specifies a tie breaker in the event 
   that two or more queues achieve an equal weighting. While this 
   condition may not occur in some implementations of a weighted 
   round robin scheduler, there are many implementations that 
   require a priority to resolve it. However, in instances where 
   this behavior is not necessary or undesirable, this attribute may 
   be left unspecified. 

 4.3.24. The Class QoSService 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model. It 
   represents the ability to conceptualize a QoS service as a set of 
   coordinated sub-services. This enables the network administrator 
   to map business rules to the network, and the network designer to 
   engineer the network such that it can provide different functions 
   for different traffic streams.

   This class has two main purposes. First, it serves as a common 
   base class for defining various sub-services that are needed to 
   build higher-level QoS services. Second, it serves as a way to 
   consolidate relationships between different types of QoS services 
   and different types of ConditioningServices. 

   For example, Gold Service may be defined as a set of sub-
   services, where each of these sub-services perform one or more 
   different functions required by the higher-level service. 
   Continuing the example, Gold Service may be used to specify EF 
   for one traffic stream along with different AF services for other 
   different traffic streams. Each of these services are instances 
   of the class QoSService, and each require a set of sub-services 
   to be defined as part of their implementation. For example, one 
   would expect to see different marking, dropping, and queuing sub-
   services to be defined for each of these services. 

   This is modeled as a type of NetworkService, which is used as the 
   anchor point for defining a set of sub-services that implement 
   the desired conditioning characteristics for different types of 
   flows. It will direct the specific type of ConditioningServices 
   to be used in order to implement this service.  

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                QoSService 
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class used to represent a QoS

 4.3.25. The Class DiffServService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. This class 
   represents using standard or custom DiffServ services to 
   implement a (higher-level) QoS service. Note that the 
   DiffServService may be just one of a set of  coordinated 
   QoSSubServices that together implement a higher-level QoS 
   service. 

   DiffServService is modeled as a specialization of QoSService. 
   This enables it to be related to a higher-level QoS service (via 
   QoSSubService) as well as to specific ConditioningServices (e.g., 
   classification, metering, dropping, queuing, and others).  

   The class definition is as follows:

 4.3.25.1. The Property DSCP 

   This attribute is an unsigned 8-bit integer. It defines the 
   Differentiated Services Code Point used to represent various 
   types of differentiated services, through device-specific 
   configuration commands. 

 4.3.26. The Class AFService 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model. It 
   represents a specialization of the general concept of forwarding 
   network traffic by adding specific semantics that characterize 
   the operation of the Assured Forwarding (AF) Service ([R2597]).  

   [R2597] defines four different AF classes to represent four 
   different treatments of traffic (e.g., a different amount of 
   forwarding resources, such as buffer space and bandwidth, are 
   allocated. Within each AF class, IP packets are marked with one 
   of three possible drop precedence values. The drop precedence of 
   a packet determines the relative importance of that packet 
   compared to other packets within the same AF class, if congestion 
   occurs. A congested interface will try to avoid dropping packets 
   with a lower drop precedence value by instead discarding packets 
   with a higher drop precedence value. 

   Note that [R2597] defines 12 DSCPs that together implement the AF 
   Per-Hop Behavior (PHB) group. Implementations are free to extend 
   this (e.g., add more classes and/or drop precedences). 

   The AFService class is modeled as a specialization of 
   DiffServService, which is in turn a specialization of QoSService. 
   This enables it to be related to a higher-level QoS services as 
   well as to lower-level sub-services (e.g., classification, 
   metering, dropping, queuing, and others).  

   The class definition is as follows:

 4.3.26.1. The Property ClassNumber 

   This attribute is an 8-bit unsigned integer that defines the 
   number of classes that this AF implementation uses. 
   Implementations should define at least 4 classes. 

 4.3.26.2. The Property DropperNumber 

   This attribute is an 8-bit unsigned integer that defines the 
   number of drop precedences that this AF implementation uses. The 
   number of drop precedence values are PER AF CLASS. 
   Implementations should define at least three drop precedence 
   values per class. 

 4.3.27. The Class EFService 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It 
   represents a specialization of the general concept of forwarding 
   network traffic by adding specific semantics that characterize 
   the operation of the Expedited Forwarding (EF) Service ([R2598]). 

   The EFService class is modeled as a specialization of 
   DiffServService, which is in turn a specialization of QoSService. 
   This enables it to be related to a higher-level QoS service as 
   well as to lower-level sub-services (e.g., classification, 
   metering, dropping, queuing, and others).  

   The EF PHB can be used to build a low loss, low latency, low 
   jitter, assured bandwidth, end-to-end service through DiffServ 
   domains.  Such a service appears to the endpoints like a point-
   to-point connection or a virtual leased line. This service has 
   also been described as Premium service. 

   [R2598] defines one DSCP for the EF service. The inherited DSCP 
   property will contain this value for all instances.  

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                EFService

                           traffic forwarding using the EF

 4.3.28. The Class PrecedenceService 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model. It 
   represents a specialization of the general concept of forwarding

   network traffic by adding specific semantics that define how 
   traffic is forwarded based on the value of the ToS byte of a 
   packet.  

   This class is used to enable DiffServ devices and non-DiffServ 
   devices to exchange traffic. This is done by defining a sibling 
   class, DiffServService, to represent devices that forward traffic 
   based on the DiffServ code point. This enables the administrator 
   to define mappings between devices that do not support DiffServ, 
   and instead use IP Precedence, to devices that do support 
   DiffServ, which use DSCPs.  

   Since the PrecedenceService class is a specialization of 
   QoSService, it can be related to higher-level QoS services using 
   the QoSSubService association. Also, it can be related to lower-
   level sub-services (e.g., classification, metering, dropping, 
   queuing, and others), using the QoSConditioingSubService 
   association. 

   The class definition is as follows:

 4.3.28.1. The Property PrecedenceValue 

   This attribute is an 8-bit unsigned integer that defines the 
   notion of precedence for different types of traffic. See [R2474] 
   for more information on the definition, backward compatibility 
   with the ToS byte of IPv4 traffic, and use of this attribute. 

 4.3.29. The Class 8021PService 

   This is a new concrete class that is defined in this model. It 
   represents a specialization of the general concept of forwarding 
   network traffic by adding specific semantics that define how 
   traffic is forwarded based on the value of the Priority field in 
   the 802.1P header.  

   This class is used to enable DiffServ devices and domains that 
   support 802.1P, to exchange traffic.  It allows implementations 
   that only support 802.1P priority marking to be mapped to 
   implementations that support DiffServ, which uses DSCPs.

   Since the 8021PService class is a specialization of QoSService, 
   it can be related to higher-level QoS services using the 
   QoSSubService association. Also, it can be related to lower-level 
   sub-services (e.g., classification, metering, dropping, queuing,

 4.3.29.1. The Property PriorityValue 

   This attribute is an 8-bit unsigned integer that defines the 
   notion of priority as specified in 802.1P implementations. 

 4.3.30. The Class FilterEntryBase  

   A simplistic but accurate view of the CIM filter classes is of: 

      - FilterEntries aggregated into FilterLists,  

      - Which are then used by the ClassifierService  

      - To separate incoming traffic into different traffic classes 
       (and service levels). 

   FilterEntryBase is an abstract class that is defined in the 
   Network Model of CIM.  It is a base class for all filter entries, 
   and is the endpoint of the association aggregating filter entries 
   into filter lists.  Its properties include CIM naming attributes 
   and an IsNegated Boolean property (to easily "NOT" the match 
   information specified in FilterEntryBase's subclasses). Please 
   refer to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.3.31. The Class FilterEntry 

   FilterEntry is a concrete class defined in the Network Model of 
   CIM.  It is specific to packet filtering, identifying traffic for 
   forwarding/further processing or for dropping. Please refer to 
   [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

   FilterEntry's properties include:

      - TrafficType (an enumeration) - Indicates the type of traffic 
       that is filtered.  This property affects what can be 
       specified in MatchCondition.  Currently, only IP-related 
       values are defined ("IPv4", "IPX" and "IPv6"). 

      - MatchConditionType (an enumeration) - Specifies the type of 
       condition that will be matched - source/destination address 
       and mask, port or port range, protocol type, DiffServ 
       codepoint, ToS Value, 802.1 Priority, etc. 

      - OtherMatchConditionType (a string) - When the 
       MatchConditionType is "Other" (value = 1), this string 
       explicitly describes the type of MatchCondition. 

      - MatchConditionValue (a string) - Indicates the specific 
       value(s) to match (or NOT match if the inherited IsNegated 
       property is TRUE).  

      - ActionType (an enumeration) - Specifies "Permit" or 
       "Deny" actions for the traffic class. 

      - DefaultFilter (a Boolean) - Defines this FilterEntry as the 
       "default" one when aggregated in a FilterList. 

      - TrafficClass  (a string) - Specifies the label for the 
       traffic class of a packet, when that packet is matched by 
       the FilterEntry.  Traffic class information is carried 
       through the sequence of ConditioningServices via the 
       NextService.TrafficClass property. 

 4.3.32. The Class FilterList 

   A concrete class defined in the Network Model of CIM.  It 
   aggregates instances (of subclasses) of FilterEntryBase via the 
   association, EntriesInFilterList.  It is possible to aggregate 
   different types of Filters into a single List - for example, 
   aggregating packet filters (which are instances of FilterEntry) 
   and security filters (which are being defined for the next 
   release of the CIM Network Model).   

   The association property, EntriesInFilterList.EntrySequence, 
   serves to order the filter entries in the FilterList.  This is 
   very useful when algorithms such as "Match First" are used to 
   identify traffic based on the aggregated Filters.  If 
   EntrySequence is set to 0, then all aggregated Filters should be 
   ANDed together to define a class of traffic. 

   Please refer to [CIM] for the full definition of the FilterList 
   and EntriesInFilterList classes.

 4.3.33. The Class ServiceAccessPoint 

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Core Model of 
   CIM. It is a subclass of the LogicalElement class, and is the 
   base class for all objects which manage access to CIM_Services.  
   It represents the management of utilizing or invoking a Service.  
   Please refer to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.3.34. The Class ProtocolEndpoint 

   This is a concrete class that is defined in the Network Common 
   Model of CIM.  It subclasses from ServiceAccessPoint and 
   describes a communication point from which the Services of the 
   network, or the System's protocol stack may be accessed.  Please 
   refer to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.3.35. The Class Collection 

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Core Model of 
   CIM. It is a superclass for all objects that are groupings or 
   bags, and carry no status or "state" (the latter would be more 
   correctly modeled as ManagedSystemElements).  Please refer to 
   [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.3.36. The Class CollectionOfMSEs  

   This is an abstract class that is defined in the Core Model of 
   CIM. It is a specialization of the Collection superclass, 
   restricting the contents of the Collection to 
   ManagedSystemElements.  Please refer to [CIM] for the full 
   definition of this class. 

 4.3.37. The Class BufferPool 

   This is a new concrete class, defined in this model. It 
   represents the collection of buffers used by a QueuingService. 
   (The association QueueAllocation describes this usage semantic.) 
   The existence and management of individual buffers will be 
   modeled in a future release. At the current level of abstraction, 
   modeling the existence of the BufferPool is necessary.  Long 
   term, it is not sufficient. 

   In implementations where there are multiple buffer sizes, an 
   instance of BufferPool should be defined for each set of buffers 
   with identical or similar sizes. These instances of buffer pools 
   can then be grouped together using the CollectedBuffersPool 
   association.  

   Note that this class is derived from CollectionOfMSEs, and not 
   from Forwarding or ConditioningService. BufferPool is only a 
   collection of storage, and is NOT a Service.

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME                BufferPool  
       DESCRIPTION         A concrete class describing the  
                           a collection of buffers. 
       DERIVED FROM        CollectionOfMSEs 
       TYPE                Structural 
       PROPERTIES          CollectionID, CreationClassName,  
                           Name, BufferSize, TotalBuffers, 
                           AvailableBuffers, SharedBuffers   
                           
 4.3.37.1. The Property CollectionID 

   CollectionID is a string property of maximum length 256 
   characters.  It identifies the buffer pool. 

 4.3.37.2. The Property CreationClassName 

   This attribute is a string property of maximum length 256 
   characters.  It is set to "CIM_BufferPool" if this class is 
   directly instantiated, or to the class name of the BufferPool 
   subclass that is created. 

 4.3.37.3. The Property Name 

   This attribute is a string of maximum length 256 characters.  It 
   is the common name or label by which the object is known. 

 4.3.37.4. The Property BufferSize 

   This attribute is a 16-bit unsigned integer, defining the number 
   of bytes in each buffer in the buffer pool. 

 4.3.37.5. The Property TotalBuffers 

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, defining the total 
   number of individual buffers in the pool. 

 4.3.37.6. The Property AvailableBuffers 

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, defining the number 
   of buffers in the Pool that are currently not allocated to any 
   instance of a QueuingService. Buffers allocated to a 
   QueuingService could either be in use (containing packet data), 
   or allocated to a Queue pending the arrival of new packet data. 

 4.3.37.7. The Property SharedBuffers 

   This attribute is a 32-bit unsigned integer, and defines the 
   number of buffers in the Pool that have been simultaneously 
   allocated to multiple instances of QueuingService.

 4.4. Relationships Defined in the State Portion of the Model 

   This section details the QoS device class associations, that were 
   presented earlier and drawn in Figure 5.  These relationships are 
   defined as classes (that can have properties) in the Information 
   Model. 

 4.4.1. The Association Dependency 

   This abstract association defines two object references (named 
   Antecedent and Dependent) that are used to establish general 
   dependency relationships between different managed objects in the 
   information model.  The Antecedent reference identifies the 
   independent object in the association, while the Dependent 
   reference identifies the entity that IS dependent.  

   The association's cardinality is many to many. 

   The association is defined in the CIM Core Model.  Please refer 
   to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.4.2. The Association ServiceSAPDependency 

   This association defines two object references that establish a 
   general dependency relationship between a Service object and a 
   ServiceAccessPoint object. This relationship indicates that the 
   referenced Service uses the ServiceAccessPoint of ANOTHER 
   Service.  The Service is the Dependent reference, relying on the 
   ServiceAccessPoint to gain access to another Service. 

   The association's cardinality is many to many. 

   The association is defined in the CIM Core Model.  Please refer 
   to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.4.3. The Association ConditioningServiceOnEndpoint 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It establishes a 
   dependency relationship between a ProtocolEndpoint object and a 
   ConditioningService object. This relationship indicates that the 
   referenced ProtocolEndpoint is used by the ConditioningService 
   for traffic to enter or leave the device. The latter is 
   distinguished by the property ServiceType, which indicates 
   whether the ConditioningService object handles incoming or out-
   going traffic. The ProtocolEndpoint represents whether the 
   traffic arrives at or leave from a network device, and the 
   ConditioningService which begins or ends the traffic conditioning 
   process within a network device. 

   This class is subclassed from the ServiceSapDependency 
   association. It restricts the Antecedent to instances of the 
   ProtocolEndpoint class (instead of the more generic 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 51] 
 Internet Draft        QoS Device Info Model               July 2000 

   ServiceAccessPoint class) and further restricts the cardinality 
   of this end of the relationship to be 0-or-1 (instead of the more 
   generic 0-or-more). It restricts the Dependent to instances of 
   the ConditioningService class (instead of the more generic 
   Service class) and further restricts the cardinality of this end 
   of the relationship to be 0-or-1 (instead of the more generic 0-
   or-more). 

   The class definition for this association is as follows: 

       NAME              ConditioningServiceOnEndpoint  
       DESCRIPTION       A generic association used to establish  
                         dependency relationships between a  
                         ConditioningService object and a  
                         ProtocolEndpoint object. 
       DERIVED FROM      ServiceSAPDependency 
       ABSTRACT          False 
       PROPERTIES        Antecedent[ref ProtocolEndpoint[0..1]], 
                         Dependent[ref ConditioningService[0..1]], 
                         ServiceType 
   
 4.4.3.1. The Reference Antecedent 

   This property is inherited from the ServiceSAPDependency 
   association, and overridden for two reasons - To serve as an 
   object reference to a ProtocolEndpoint object (instead of the 
   more general ServiceAccessPoint object), and To update 
   cardinality. This reference defines the ProtocolEndpoint through 
   which traffic arrives at or leaves from a network device. 

 4.4.3.2. The Reference Dependent 

   This property is inherited from the ServiceSAPDependency 
   association, and overridden to serve as an object reference to a 
   ConditioningService object (instead of the more general Service 
   object) and to update cardinality. This reference indicates the 
   ConditioningService that begins or ends the traffic conditioning 
   processing within a network device. 

 4.4.3.3. The Property ServiceType 

   This property is a 16-bit unsigned integer that indicates whether 
   a packet is incoming (value = 1, "Ingress") or out-going (value = 
   2, "Egress") at the ProtocolEndpoint, relative to the 
   ConditioningService. 

 4.4.4. The Association ServiceServiceDependency 

   This association defines two object references that establish a 
   dependency relationship between two Service objects. The 
   particular type of dependency is described by the 
   TypeOfDependency property; typical examples include that one 


 Strassner, et al.     Expires: Jul 2000 + 6 months        [Page 52]

   Service is required to be present or required to have completed 
   for the other Service to operate. 

   This association is very similar to the ServiceSAPDependency 
   relationship.  For the latter, the Service is dependent on an 
   AccessPoint to get at another Service.  In this relationship, it 
   directly identifies its Service dependency.  Both relationships 
   should not be instantiated - since their information is 
   repetitive. 

   The association's cardinality is many to many. 

   The association is defined in the CIM Core Model.  Please refer 
   to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.4.5. The Association QueueHierarchy 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It is a subclass 
   of ServiceServiceDependency, and defines two object references 
   that are used to establish a dependency relationship between two 
   QueuingService objects. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME              QueueHierarchy  
       DESCRIPTION       A generic association used to establish  
                         dependency relationships between two  
                         QueuingService objects.

                         Dependent[ref QueuingService[0..n]] 
   
 4.4.5.1. The Reference Antecedent 

   This property is inherited from the ServiceServiceDependency 
   association, and overridden to serve as an object reference to a 
   QueuingService object (instead of the more general Service 
   object). It also restricts the cardinality of this end of the 
   relationship to 0-or-1 (instead of the more generic 0-or-more). 
   This reference defines the supporting queue through its 
   QueuingService. This QueuingService can only support at most one 
   higher-level QueuingService. 

 4.4.5.2. The Reference Dependent 

   This property is inherited from the ServiceServiceDependency 
   association, and overridden to serve as an object reference to a 
   QueuingService object (instead of the more general Service 
   object). This reference indicates the QueuingService that depends 
   on another QueuingService.

 4.4.6. The Association SchedulerUsed 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It is a subclass 
   of ServiceServiceDependency, and defines two object references 
   that establish a dependency relationship between a 
   PacketSchedulingService and one or more QueuingService objects. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME              SchedulerUsed  
       DESCRIPTION       A generic association used to establish  
                         dependency relationships between a  
                         specific PacketSchedulingService and one   
                         or more QueuingService objects. 
       DERIVED FROM      ServiceServiceDependency 
       ABSTRACT          False

                         Dependent[ref QueuingService[0..n]] 

 4.4.6.1. The Reference Antecedent 

   This property is inherited from the ServiceServiceDependency 
   association, and overridden to serve as an object reference to a 
   PacketSchedulingService object (instead of the more general 
   Service object). It also restricts the cardinality of this 
   relationship to exactly 1 instance (instead of the more generic 
   0-or-more instances). This reference defines the 
   PacketSchedulingService, which is used to empty the queue(s) 
   controlled by the QueuingService. 

 4.4.6.2. The Reference Dependent 

   This property is inherited from the ServiceServiceDependency 
   association, and overridden to serve as an object reference to a 
   QueuingService object (instead of the more general Service 
   object). This reference indicates the queue(s) and the associated 
   QueuingService that depends on the PacketSchedulingService. 

 4.4.7. The Association AFRelatedServices 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It defines two 
   object references that establish a dependency relationship 
   between two AFService objects. This dependency is the precedence 
   of the individual AF drop-related Services within an AF IP 
   packet-forwarding class. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME              AFRelatedServices  
       DESCRIPTION       An association used to establish  
                         a dependency relationship between two

                         AFService objects. 
       DERIVED FROM      Nothing 
       ABSTRACT          False 
       PROPERTIES        AFLowerDropPrecedence[ref  
                            AFService[0..1]],     
                         AFHigherDropPrecedence[ref  
                            AFService[0..n]] 
   
 4.4.7.1. The Reference AFLowerDropPrecedence 

   This property serves as an object reference to an AFService 
   object that has the lower probability of dropping packets. 

 4.4.7.2. The Reference AFHigherDropPrecedence 

   This property serves as an object reference to an AFService 
   object that has the higher probability of dropping packets. 

 4.4.8. The Association NextService 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It defines two 
   object references that establish a dependency relationship 
   between two ConditioningService objects. This association is used 
   to indicate the sequence of ConditioningServices required to 
   process a particular type of traffic.  

   Instances of this dependency describe the various relationships 
   between different ConditioningServices (such as Classifiers, 
   Meters, Droppers, etc.) that are used collectively to condition 
   traffic. Both one-to-one and more complicated fan-in and/or fan-
   out relationships can be described. The ConditioningServices may 
   feed one another directly, or be mapped to multiple "next" 
   Services based on the characteristics of the packet. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME              NextService  
       DESCRIPTION       An association used to establish  
                         a dependency relationship between two  
                         ConditioningService objects.

 4.4.8.1. The Reference PrecedingService 

   This property serves as an object reference to a 
   ConditioningService object that occurs earlier in the processing 
   sequence for a given type of traffic. 

 4.4.8.2. The Reference FollowingService 

   This property serves as an object reference to a 
   ConditioningService object that occurs later in the processing 
   sequence for a given type of traffic. 

 4.4.8.3. The Property TrafficClass 

   This property is a string that is used to identify different 
   traffic flows that have been separated by the Classifier 
   ConditioningService.  

   This property enables a ConditioningService to forward multiple 
   traffic flows to (for example) the same "next" 
   ConditioningService while maintaining their traffic identity. 

 4.4.9. The Association NextServiceAfterMeter 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It defines two 
   object references that establish a dependency relationship 
   between a MeterService and one or more ConditioningService 
   objects that process traffic from the MeterService. It subclasses 
   the NextService association to restrict the independent (or 
   PrecedingService) to be a MeterService.  

   Meters are 1:n fan-out elements, which means that we need a way 
   to distinguish between the different outputs of the meter. 
   Therefore, this association also defines a new property, 
   MeterResult, which can be used to identify which output of the 
   meter this traffic originated from. 

   The class definition is as follows: 

       NAME              NextServiceAfterMeter  
       DESCRIPTION       An association used to establish  
                         a dependency relationship between a  
                         particular output of a MeterService 
                         and the next ConditioningService 
                         object that is responsible for further 
                         processing of the traffic.

 4.4.9.1. The Reference PrecedingService 

   This property is inherited from the NextService association. It 
   is overridden in this subclass to restrict the object reference 
   to a MeterService, as opposed to the more general 
   ConditioningService defined in the NextService superclass. 

   This property serves as an object reference to a MeterService 
   object that occurs earlier in the processing sequence for a given 
   type of traffic. Since Meters are 1:n fan-out devices, this 
   relationship associates a particular output of a MeterService 
   (identified by the MeterResult property) to the next 
   ConditioningService that is used to further process the traffic. 

 4.4.9.2. The Property MeterResult 

   This property is an enumerated 16-bit unsigned integer, and 
   represents information describing the result of the metering. 
   Traffic is distinguished as being in- or out-of-profile, or 
   partially conforming. More complicated metering can be built by 
   either extending the enumeration or by cascading meters.  

   The enumerated values are: "Unknown" (0), "In-profile" (1), 
   "Partially Conforming" (2), "Out-of-profile" (3). 

 4.4.10. The Aggregation Component 

   This abstract aggregation is a generic relationship used to 
   establish "part-of" relationships between managed objects (named 
   GroupComponent and PartComponent). The association's cardinality 
   is many to many. 

   The association is defined in the CIM Core Model.  Please refer 
   to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.4.11. The Aggregation ServiceComponent 

   This aggregation is used to model a set of subordinate Services 
   that are aggregated together to form a higher-level Service. This 
   aggregation is subclassed from the more generic Component 
   superclass to restrict the types of objects that can participate 
   in this relationship. 

   The association is defined in the CIM Core Model.  Please refer 
   to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.4.12. The Aggregation QoSSubService 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It is used to 
   model a set of subordinate QoSServices that are aggregated 
   together to form a higher-level QoSService. A QoSService is a

   specific type of Service that conceptualizes QoS functionality as 
   a set of coordinated sub-services. 

   This aggregation is subclassed from the more generic 
   ServiceComponent superclass to restrict the types of objects that 
   can participate in this relationship to QoSService objects, 
   instead of a more generic Service object. It also restricts the 
   cardinality of the aggregate to 0-or-1 (instead of the more 
   generic 0-or-more). 

   The class definition for the aggregation is as follows:

                         higher-level QoSService object and the 
                         set of lower-level QoSServices that 
                         are aggregated to create/form it.

 4.4.12.1. The Reference GroupComponent 

   This property is overridden in this relationship to represent an 
   object reference to a QoSService object (instead of the more 
   generic Service object defined in its superclass). This object 
   represents the parent, or aggregate, object in the relationship. 

 4.4.12.2. The Reference PartComponent 

   This property is overridden in this relationship to represent an 
   object reference to a QoSService object (instead of the more 
   generic Service object defined in its superclass). This object 
   represents the child, or "component", object in the relationship. 

 4.4.13. The Aggregation QoSConditioningSubService 

   This association is new, defined in this model.  It is used to 
   define the set of ConditioningServices that together condition 
   traffic for a particular QoSService. 

   This aggregation is subclassed from the more generic 
   ServiceComponent superclass to restrict the types of objects that 
   can participate in this relationship to ConditioningService and 
   QoSService objects, instead of a more generic Service object. 

   The class definition for the aggregation is as follows:

 4.4.13.1. The Reference GroupComponent 

   This property is overridden in this relationship to represent an 
   object reference to a QoSService object (instead of the more 
   generic Service object defined in its superclass).  It also 
   restricts the cardinality of the aggregate to 0-or-1 (instead of 
   the more generic 0-or-more). 

   This object represents the parent, or aggregate, object in the 
   relationship. In this case, this object represents the QoSService 
   that aggregates one or more ConditioningService objects to 
   implement the appropriate traffic conditioning for its traffic. 

 4.4.13.2. The Reference PartComponent 

   This property is overridden in this relationship to represent an 
   object reference to a ConditioningService object (instead of the 
   more generic Service object defined in its superclass). This 
   object represents the child, or "component", object in the 
   relationship. In this case, this object represents one or more 
   ConditioningService objects that together define how traffic for 
   a specific QoSService will be conditioned. 

 4.4.14. The Aggregation MemberOfCollection 

   This aggregation is a generic relationship used to model the 
   aggregation of a set of ManagedElements in a generalized 
   Collection object. The association's cardinality is many to many. 

   The association is defined in the CIM Core Model.  Please refer 
   to [CIM] for the full definition of this class. 

 4.4.15. The Aggregation CollectedBufferPool 

   This relationship is used to model the ability to treat a set of 
   buffers as a pool, or collection, that can in turn be contained 
   in a "higher-level" buffer pool. This class overrides the more 
   generic MemberOfCollection aggregation to restrict both the 
   aggregate and the part component objects to be instances only of 
   the BufferPool class.

   The class definition for the aggregation is as follows: 

       NAME              CollectedBufferPool  
       DESCRIPTION       A generic association used to aggregate 
                         a set of related buffers into a   
                         higher-level buffer pool.   
       DERIVED FROM      MemberOfCollection 
       ABSTRACT          False 
       PROPERTIES        Collection[ref BufferPool[0..n]], 
                         Member[ref BufferPool[0..n]]  
   
 4.4.15.1. The Reference Collection 

   This property represents the parent, or aggregate, object in the 
   relationship. It is a BufferPool object. 

 4.4.15.2. The Reference Member 

   This property represents the child, or lower level pool, in the 
   relationship. It is one of the set of BufferPools that together 
   make up the higher-level pool. 

 4.4.16. The Aggregation EntriesInFilterList 

   This aggregation is a specialization of the Component association
   and is used to define a set of filter entries (subclasses of  
   FilterEntryBase) that are aggregated by a FilterList. Cardinality 
   is many to many.

   The association is defined in the Network Model of CIM.  Please 
   refer to [CIM] for the full class definition. 


 5. Intellectual Property 

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described 
   in this document or the extent to which any license under such 
   rights might or might not be available; neither does it represent 
   that it has made any effort to identify any such rights.  
   Information on the IETF's procedures with respect to rights in 
   standards-track and standards-related documentation can be found 
   in BCP-11. 

   Copies of claims of rights made available for publication and any 
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an 
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the 
   use of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this 
   specification can be obtained from the IETF Secretariat.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention 
   any copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other 
   proprietary rights which may cover technology that may be 
   required to practice this standard.  Please address the 
   information to the IETF Executive Director. 


 6. Acknowledgements 

   The authors wish to thank the participants of the Policy 
   Framework working group for their many helpful comments and 
   suggestions.  


 7. Security Considerations 

   Security and denial of service considerations are not explicitly 
   considered in this memo, as they are appropriate for the 
   underlying policy architecture implementing the distribution and 
   communication of the information described in this draft. 
   Specifically, any mechanisms used to distribute and communicate 
   the information described in this draft must minimize theft and 
   denial of service threats. Second, it must be ensured that the 
   entities involved in policy control can verify each other's 
   identity and establish necessary trust before communicating. 

   The communication tunnel between policy clients and policy 
   servers SHOULD be secured by the use of an IPSEC [R1825] channel. 
   It is advisable that this tunnel makes use of both the AH 
   (Authentication Header) and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) 
   protocols, in order to provide confidentiality, data origin 
   authentication, integrity and replay prevention.
