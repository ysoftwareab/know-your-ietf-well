                        MSRP over Data Channels
              draft-ietf-mmusic-msrp-usage-data-channel-09

Abstract

   This document specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP)
   can be instantiated as a data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP
   offer/answer exchange-based generic data channel negotiation
   framework.  Two network configurations are documented: a WebRTC end-
   to-end configuration (connecting two MSRP over data channel
   endpoints), and a gateway configuration (connecting an MSRP over data
   channel endpoint with an MSRP over TCP or TLS endpoint).

1.  Introduction

   The Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) [RFC4975] is a protocol for
   transmitting a series of related instant messages in the context of a
   session.  In addition to instant messaging, MSRP can also be used for
   image sharing or file transfer.  MSRP is currently defined to work
   over TCP and TLS connections, and a WebSocket subprotocol specified
   by [RFC4975].

   This document defines the negotiation and transport of this MSRP
   protocol over data channels, where a data channel is a bi-directional
   communication channel running on top of SCTP/DTLS (as per
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel]) and where MSRP is instantiated as a
   sub-protocol of this data channel.  The MSRP protocol negotiation
   defined in this document is based on the generic SDP offer/answer
   exchange based data channel negotiation as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   Defining MSRP as a data channel sub-protocol has many benefits:

   o  provides to applications a proven protocol enabling instant
      messaging, file transfer, image sharing

   o  integrates those features with other RTCWeb voice, video and data
      features

   o  leverages the SDP-based negotiation already defined for MSRP

   o  allows the interworking with MSRP endpoints running on a TCP or
      TLS connection

   Compared to WebSockets, that provide a message passing protocol to
   applications with no direct access to TCP or TLS sockets, data

   channels provide a low latency transport, leverage NAT-aware
   connectivity and security features of WebRTC, and are increasingly
   available not only in modern browsers but in other applications that
   use WebRTC for media or other purposes (IoT or telemetry in general,
   non-media data exchange, etc).

   Considering an MSRP endpoint being an MSRP application that uses data
   channel from WebRTC specifications [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel],
   this document describes two configurations where the other endpoint
   is respectively either another MSRP over data channel endpoint (e.g.,
   a WebRTC application) or an MSRP endpoint using either TCP or TLS
   transport.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms:

      Data channel: A WebRTC data channel as specified in
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

      MSRP data channel: A data channel specifically used to transport
      the messages of one MSRP session.

      External negotiation: Data channel negotiation based on out-of-
      band or in-band mechanisms other than the Data Channel
      Establishment Protocol specified in
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-protocol].

      In-band: Transmission through the peer-to-peer SCTP association.

      Out-of-band: Transmission through the call control signaling path,
      e.g., using JSEP [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-jsep] and the SDP Offer/Answer
      model [RFC3264].

      Peer: From the perspective of one of the agents in a session, its
      peer is the other agent.  Specifically, from the perspective of
      the SDP offerer, the peer is the SDP answerer.  From the
      perspective of the SDP answerer, the peer is the SDP offerer.

4.  Principles

4.1.  MSRP Data Channel

   In this document, an MSRP data channel is a data channel for which
   the instantiated sub-protocol is "MSRP", and where the MSRP-related
   negotiation is done as part of the SDP-based external negotiation
   method defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

4.2.  Session Mapping

   In this design, the MSRP session maps to the SCTP association and the
   "SCTP stream pair" assigned to the data channel, and each MSRP
   session maps to one data channel exactly.

4.3.  MSRP URI

   This document extends the MSRP URI syntax [RFC4975] by defining the
   new transport parameter value "dc":

   transport  /= "dc" / 1*ALPHANUM
                 ; Add "dc" to existing transports per [RFC4975]

   MSRP design provides for new transport bindings, see Section 6 of
   [RFC4975], MSRP implementations are expected to allow unrecognized
   transports for which there is no need to establish a connection to
   the resource described by the URI, as it's the case of data channels
   (Section 5.1.2).

4.4.  msrp-scheme

   The msrp-scheme portion of the MSRP-URI that represents an MSRP data
   channel endpoint (used in the SDP path attribute and in the MSRP
   message headers) is always "msrps", which indicates that the MSRP
   data channel is always secured using DTLS as described in
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-data-channel].

5.  End-to-End Configuration

   This section describes the network configuration where each MSRP
   endpoint is running MSRP over a data channel.

5.1.1.  Session Negotiation

5.1.1.1.  Use of the dcmap Attribute

   The SDP offer SHALL include a dcmap attribute line (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]) within the media description
   of the SCTP association for each MSRP data channel session to be
   negotiated.

   The attribute includes the following data channel parameters:

   o  "label=" labelstring

   o  "subprotocol=" "MSRP"

   The labelstring is set by the MSRP application according to
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].  Ordered and reliable data
   channels MUST always be used, so that the "max-retr" and "max-time"
   parameters SHALL NOT be used.  If the "ordered" parameter is used,
   then its value MUST be equal to "true".

   Rest of the SDP offer/answer procedures are per
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   The following is an example of the dcmap attribute for an MSRP
   session to be negotiated with stream-id=2 and label="chat":

   a=dcmap:2 label="chat";subprotocol="MSRP"

5.1.1.2.  Use of the dcsa Attribute

   The SDP offer SHALL also include within the media description for the
   SCTP association, a dcsa attribute line (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]) for each MSRP-specific SDP
   attribute to be negotiated for each MSRP data channel being
   negotiated.

   The MSRP-specific items that can be negotiated include at least all
   of the following well-known attributes:

   o  defined in [RFC4975]: "path", "accept-types", "accept-wrapped-
      types", "max-size"

   o  defined in [RFC4566]: "sendonly", "recvonly", "inactive", and
      "sendrecv"

   o  defined in [RFC6135]: "setup"

Internet-Draft           MSRP over Data Channels                May 2018


   o  defined in [RFC6714]: "msrp-cema"

   o  defined in [RFC5547]: all the parameters related to MSRP file
      transfer.  See Section 5.2.

   The msrp-cema attribute SHALL be assumed to be present for every MSRP
   session using data channel transport, so the inclusion of the msrp-
   cema attribute is OPTIONAL.  This ensures that the data channel
   transport for the MSRP session is established without using the path
   attribute.

   The SDP answer SHALL include zero or more corresponding dcsa
   attribute lines for each negotiated MSRP session, according to the
   MSRP-specific attribute negotiation rules in the corresponding
   specifications.

   A new SDP offer/answer MAY update the MSRP subprotocol attributes
   while keeping the same subprotocol a=dcmap description.  The
   semantics for newly negotiated MSRP subprotocol attributes are per
   [RFC4975].

5.1.1.3.  Use of the setup Attribute

   A dsca embedded setup attribute, as defined in [RFC4145], MUST be
   used for MSRP sessions over data channels.  It is used to negotiate
   which MSRP session endpoint assumes the active role as per
   Section 4.2.2 of [RFC6135] and Section 5.4 of [RFC4975].  It has no
   relationship with the DTLS connection establishment roles.

   The dcsa embedded setup attribute is of the form "a=dcsa:x
   setup:<role>", with x being the data channel's SCTP stream
   identifier, so that such attribute is explicitly associated with an
   MSRP session over a specific data channel.

   It is considered an error if an MSRP over data channel description
   does not contain a dcsa embedded setup attribute.

   The SDP setup attribute can also be used in WebRTC data channel
   related SDP media descriptions as a media level attribute, which is
   associated with the corresponding UDP/DTLS/SCTP or TCP/DTLS/SCTP "m"
   line.  Such an "a=setup" attribute is used as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-sctp-sdp] in order to negotiate the establishment
   roles of the DTLS connection and has no relationship with the MSRP
   session.

5.1.1.4.  Example SDP Negotiation

   The following is an example of an "m" line for data channels in an
   SDP offer that includes the attributes needed to establish two MSRP
   sessions: one for chat and one for file transfer.  The example is
   derived from a combination of examples in [RFC4975] and [RFC5547].

      a=dcsa:2 file-range:1-1463440

5.1.2.  Session Opening

   Section 5.1.1.3 describes how the active MSRP session endpoint role
   is negotiated.  The active MSRP session endpoint does not use the
   path attribute to open a transport connection to its peer.  Instead,
   it uses the data channel established for this MSRP session by the
   generic data channel opening procedure defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   As soon as this data channel is opened, the MSRP session is actually
   opened by the active MSRP session endpoint.  In order to do this the
   active MSRP endpoint sends an MSRP SEND message (empty or not) to the
   other MSRP endpoint.  The msrp-cema attribute is implicitly
   associated with every MSRP session using data channel transport.

Internet-Draft           MSRP over Data Channels                May 2018


5.1.3.  Data Framing

   Each text-based MSRP message is sent on the corresponding SCTP stream
   using standard MSRP framing and chunking procedures, as defined in
   [RFC4975], with each MSRP chunk delivered in a single SCTP user
   message.  Therefore all sent MSRP chunks including the MSRP chunk
   header MUST have lengths of less than or equal to the value of the
   peer's "a=max-message-size" attribute, which is associated with the
   data channel's SCTP association.

5.1.4.  Data Sending and Reporting

   Data sending and reporting procedures SHALL conform to RFC 4975.

5.1.5.  Session Closing

   The closure of an MSRP session MUST be signaled via an SDP offer/
   answer exchange which removes the "a=dcmap:" and "a=dcsa:" attribute
   lines associated with the MSRP session from the associated DTLS/SCTP
   based media description.  This results in the associated data channel
   being closed as well as per [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg],
   where the actual data channel closure procedure is typically
   initiated by the SDP answerer right after having accepted the SDP
   offer.

   The port value for the "m" line SHOULD NOT be changed (e.g. to zero)
   when closing an MSRP session (unless all data channels are being
   closed and the SCTP association is no longer needed), since this
   would close the SCTP association and impact all of the data channels.
   In all cases in [RFC4975] where the procedure calls for setting the
   port to zero for the MSRP "m" line in an SDP offer for TCP transport,
   the SDP offerer of an MSRP session with data channel transport SHALL
   remove the corresponding dcmap and dcsa attributes.

   The SDP answerer must ensure that no dcmap or dcsa attributes are
   present in the SDP answer if no corresponding attributes are present
   in the received SDP offer.

5.2.  Support for MSRP File Transfer Function

   [RFC5547] defines an end-to-end file transfer method based on MSRP
   and the SDP offer/answer mechanism.  This file transfer method is
   also usable by MSRP endpoints using data channels, with the following
   considerations:

   o  As an MSRP session maps to one data channel, a file transfer
      session maps also to one data channel.

Internet-Draft           MSRP over Data Channels                May 2018


   o  SDP attributes specified in [RFC5547] for a file transfer "m" line
      are embedded as subprotocol-specific attributes using the syntax
      defined in [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg].

   o  Once the file transfer is complete, the same data channel MAY be
      reused for another file transfer.

6.  Gateway Configuration

   This section describes the network configuration where one MSRP
   endpoint uses data channels as MSRP transport, the other MSRP
   endpoint uses TLS/TCP connections as MSRP transport, and the two MSRP
   endpoints interwork via an MSRP gateway.

   Specifically, a gateway can be configured to interwork an MSRP
   session over a data channel with a peer that does not support data
   channel transport in one of two ways.

   In one model, the gateway performs as a MSRP B2BUA to interwork all
   the procedures as necessary between the endpoints.  No further
   specification is needed for this model.

   Alternately, the gateway can use CEMA procedures to provide transport
   level interworking between MSRP endpoints using different transport
   protocols as follows.

   When the gateway performs transport level interworking between MSRP
   endpoints, all of the procedures in Section 5 apply to each peer,
   with the following additions:

   o  The endpoint establishing an MSRP session using data channel
      transport SHALL NOT request inclusion of any relays, although it
      MAY interoperate with a peer that signals the use of relays.

   o  The gateway receiving an SDP offer that includes a request to
      negotiate an MSRP session on a data channel can provide transport
      level interworking by forwarding TCP or TLS transport parameters
      in a new "m" line with the appropriate attributes within the
      forwarded SDP offer.

      *  Especially, the gateway interworks the received MSRP over data
         channel associated dcsa embedded setup attribute with the media
         description level "a=setup" attribute of the MSRP over TCP or
         TLS "m" line within its forwarded SDP offer.

   o  Similarly, a gateway receiving an SDP offer to negotiate an MSRP
      session using TCP or TLS transport with an endpoint that only
      supports data channel transport for MSRP can provide transport

      level interworking by establishing a new data channel for the MSRP
      session with the target endpoint.

      *  In this case the gateway interworks the received MSRP over TCP
         or TLS associated "a=setup" attribute with the dcsa embedded
         setup attribute of the generated MSRP over data channel
         description.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Subprotocol Identifier MSRP

   NOTE to RFC Editor: Please replace "XXXX" with the number of this
   RFC.

   This document adds the subprotocol identifier "MSRP" to the
   "WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry" as follows:

                  +--------------------------+---------+
                  | Subprotocol Identifier:  | MSRP    |
                  | Subprotocol Common Name: | MSRP    |
                  | Subprotocol Definition:  | RFCXXXX |
                  | Reference:               | RFCXXXX |
                  +--------------------------+---------+

7.2.  setup Attribute

   NOTE to RFC Editor: Please replace "XXXX" with the number of this
   RFC.

   This document modifies the usage of the SDP setup attribute, if this
   attribute is embedded in a dcsa attribute and associated with an MSRP
   session over a data channel.  The modified usage is described in
   Section 5.1.1.3.

   Usage level "dcsa(MSRP)" should be added to the IANA registration of
   the SDP setup attribute as follows:

   +-----------------------+-------------------------------------------+
   | Contact name:         | MMUSIC Chairs                             |
   | Contact email:        | mmusic-chairs@ietf.org                    |
   | Attribute name:       | setup                                     |
   | Usage level:          | dcsa(MSRP)                                |
   | Purpose:              | Negotiate the active role of an MSRP      |
   |                       | session over a data channel as per        |
   |                       | Section 5.1.1.3                           |

10.8.  Changes against 'draft-ietf-mmusic-msrp-usage-data-channel-01'

   o  In the abstract replacement of the first sentence "This document
      specifies how the Message Session Relay Protocol (MSRP) can be
      instantiated as a data channel sub-protocol, using the SDP offer/
      answer exchange-based external negotiation defined in

      in order to remove the reference from the abstract text.

   o  Addition of following sentence to the second paragraph in
      Section 1: "The MSRP protocol negotiation defined in this document
      is based on the generic SDP offer/answer exchange based data
      channel negotiation as specified in
      [I-D.ietf-mmusic-data-channel-sdpneg]".

   o  In Section 4.1 replacement of sub-protocol identifier "msrp" with
      "MSRP" in order to make this consistent with the formal
      specification in Section 5.1.1.1.

   o  Throughout the text replacement of "shall" with "SHALL" etc where
      appropriate as per [RFC2119].

   o  In Section 5.1.1.1 replacement of sentence 'The max-retr, max-time
      and ordered parameters shall not be used.' with 'Ordered and

   o  Appended following sentence at the end of the first paragraph of
      Section 5.1.3: "Therefore all sent MSRP chunks MUST have lengths
      of less than or equal to the value of the peer's "a=max-message-
      size" attribute, which is associated with the data channel's SCTP
