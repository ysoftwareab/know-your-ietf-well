1.  Introduction

   The Softwire working group is currently discussing both encapsulation
   and translation based stateless IPv4/IPv6 solutions developed for the
   purposes of offering IPv4 connectivity to the customers in an
   IPv6-Only environment.

   In the all stages of transition from IPv4 to IPv6, IPv4 networks/
   hosts and IPv6 networks/hosts are likely to coexist.  For the
   operators, supporting inter-connection is inevitable.  One-time
   translation mechanisms emerged as required.

   With the IPv6 development, IPv4 Internet has been gradually replaced.
   For the low cost, network operators tend to build IPv6 network rather
   than dual-stack network.  In order to ensure the compatibility of
   legacy IPv4 application, IPv4-IPv6-IPv4 double translation scheme is
   provided.

   Generic mechanism for one-time translation mechanisms are specified
   in [RFC2765], [RFC6219], [RFC2766], [RFC6146], [RFC6535], and double
   translation mechanisms are specified in [RFC6877], [I-D.ietf-
   softwire-map],etc.  With the diverse characteristics and transition
   requirements of practical networks and the lack of overall transition

   architecture, the selection and deployment of IPv6 transition
   mechanisms are very difficult.

   In an effort to push forward the IPv6 transition process, this
   document describles the basic issues and key elements of translation
   mechanisms,and presents the applicability index that would help the
   operators decide on the development scheme for their IPv6
   transition.It could lead to significant operational benefits and
   potential savings for the operators.

2.  The Basic Issues and Key elements of Translation Mechanisms

   Translation scheme is used to achieve direct communication between
   IPv4 and IPv6 networks (or hosts).

2.1.  Basic Issues

   Its basic operation is to convert the semantics between IPv4 and
   IPv6, turning IPv4 packet into IPv6 if the packet is destined to IPv6
   network, or turning IPv6 packet into IPv4 if the packet is destined
   to IPv4 network.

   a.  The basic data operation.  IPv4-IPv6 packet translation is the
       basic data plane operation.  It involves network, transport, and
       application layer.  Thus, the basic operations include address
       and port conversion, IP/TCP/UDP protocol field translation, and
       application layer translation (address and port conversion when
       they appear in application protocol).  What is more, to overcome
       further diversities in the protocol definition between IPv4 and
       IPv6, translation has to take care of issues like fragmentation
       and reassembling, path MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) discovery,
       ICMP, etc.

   b.  The basic control operation.  The basic control plane operation
       is the address conversion rule: either some special address
       scheme needs to be deployed in advance, or dynamic address
       bindings have to be built during the translation.  Heterogeneous
       addressing (learning the in-protocol address of the remote end)
       and corresponding routing should be performed based on the
       address conversion rule.

   c.  The translation model.  According to the applicable scenarios,
       the models of IPv6 translation mechanisms are divided into
       application-side, network-side and host-side translation.
       According to the address conversion manner, we can also divide
       network-side translation mechanisms into stateless translation
       and stateful translation.

2.2.  Key Elements

   a.  Transition equipment.  In translation technologies, the
       translator is the transition equipments.  Usually, network-side
       translation happens on the IPv4-IPv6 border, so the translator
       would be an AFBR (Address Family Border Router).  And host-side
       translation happens in the TCP/IP stack of the end host, so the
       translator would be host.  They should support address and port
       conversion, IP/TCP/UDP protocol field translation and also
       maintain the state.  Thus, translator has requirements in the use
       of bandwidth, computing and finding, storage.

   b.  Address translation.  Using specific address conversion rules,
       the translator either gets IPv4 address from a specific position
       of IPv6 address, or builds the IPv6 address using IPv4 address.
       The address conversion rule includes some special address scheme
       needs to be deployed in advance, and dynamic address bindings
       have to be built during the translation.

   c.  Other fields translation.  Except the source address and
       destination address, there are other fields (fragmentation ID,
       checksum, ban-fragmentation flag, etc.) in IP/ICMP packets, which
       carry specific information.  In the IPv4-IPv6 translation
       process, the header information of IPv4 packet cannot be lost.
       Therefore, translation techniques are required to ensure the
       integrity of IPv4 information.

   d.  State maintenance.  In IPv6 transition, the state is available to
       only represent a series of attributes mapping relationship among
       a communication entity (such as client, server), a communication
       path (the connection between communication entities), or a
       communication process (control flow and data flow).  The IP
       address in network layer and ID in transport layer of the
       communication entities are the core state which need translation
       techniques to maintain.

   e.  DNS64 and DNS46.  The main function of DNS64 and DNS46 is to
       realize the bi-directional translation between A and AAAA record.
       DNS64 translates the AAAA query from IPv6 hosts into A query when
       receiving one, and DNS46 translates the A response for IPv6 hosts
       into AAAA response following the IPv4-mapped address rule before
       sending one out.  There are usually two kinds of implementations:
       static configuration DNS records and dynamic translation.

   f.  Application layer translation.  Those applications whose address
       and port conversion when they appear in application protocol
       cannot work in NAT and IPv4/IPv6 translation environments.  Such

       as FTP, SIP, etc.  One solution is assist applications to realize
       translation work by using the application layer gateway.

3.  Applicability Index of Translation

   There are applicability index which need to be analyzed by the
   operator when choosing which transition technology option they would
   like to deploy.  The applicability index in terms of sustainable,
   applications, performance, development and security.  This section
   describes some of those considerations.

3.1.  Sustainable Index

   Sustainable index would include:

   a.  The scenarios and function of transition represents whether meet
       the needs of transitional scenario.

   b.  Both (a)the coupling degree between IPv4 address and (b) IPv6
       address and the reuse rate of IPv4 addresses resource represent
       whether promote the deployment and usage of IPv6.

3.2.  The Support Degree of Business Application Index

   The support degree of business application index would include:

   a.  The support degree of IPv4 application represents the impact on
       the IPv4 business application.

   b.  The support degree of IPv6 application represents the impact on
       the IPv6 business application.

3.3.  The Preformance Index

   The preformance index would include:

   a.  The performance requirements of translator can be divided into
       (a) the routing information announcement and (b) the space and
       time overhead of state maintenance, which represents the capacity
       of bandwidth, computing and finding, storage.

   b.  The routing scalability can be represented by the aggregation of
       IPv6 addresses, which represents the impact on the scope of
       deployment.

   c.  Robustness represents the capacity of redundancy backup.

3.4.  The Development Index

   The cost of development index would include:

   a.  Technological and industry maturity represent the support degree
       of standard.

   b.  The update cost can be divided into (a) the impact on application
       layer, (b) the impact on network layerand and (c) the impact on
       end users layer, which represent the impact on the present
       network.

   c.  The cost of operation, management and maintenance represent the
       impact on the operator.

3.5.  The Security Index

   The security index includes the security issues and concerns.

4.  Conclusions

   For the consideration of deployment scenarios and address format,
   numerous translation mechanisms have been proposed in the past
   several years.  However, due to a wide range of mechanisms and a lot
   of overlap and similar functions, no one translation mechanism can be
   used in all transition scenarios.

   The applicability index of translation mechanisms described in this
   document have highlighted the applicability of all translation
   mechanisms to help the operators decide on the development scheme for
   their IPv6 transition.
