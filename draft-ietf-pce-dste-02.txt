1. Introduction 

   The Internet Draft [PCEP-ID] specifies the Path Computation Element 
   communication Protocol (PCEP) for communications between a Path 
   Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation Element (PCE), or 
   between two PCEs, in compliance with [RFC4657].  

   Differentiated Service aware MPLS Traffic Engineering (DS-TE) 
   addresses the fundamental requirement to be able to enforce different 
   bandwidth constraints for different classes of traffic. It describes 
   mechanisms to achieve per-class traffic engineering, rather than on 
   an aggregate basis across all classes by enforcing Bandwidth 
   Constraints (BCs) on different classes. Requirements for DS-TE and

   the associated protocol extensions are specified in [RFC3564] and 
   [RFC4124] respectively. 

   As per [RFC4657], PCEP must support traffic class-type as an MPLS TE 
   specific constraint. However, in the present form, PCEP [PCEP-ID] 
   does not have the capability to specify the class-type in the path 
   computation request. 

   In this document, we define a new PCEP object called CLASSTYPE which 
   carries the class-type of the TE LSP in the path computation request. 
   During path computation, a PCE uses the class-type to identify the 
   bandwidth constraint of the TE-LSP. 

2. Terminology 

   CT: Class type: A set of Traffic Trunks governed by a set of 
   bandwidth constraints. Used for the purpose of link bandwidth 
   allocation, constraint based routing and admission control. A given 
   Traffic Trunk belongs to the same CT on all links. 

   DS-TE: Diff-Serv Aware Traffic Engineering. 

   LSR: Label Switching Router. 

   LSP: Label Switched Path. 

   PCC: Path Computation Client: any client application requesting a 
   path computation to be performed by a Path Computation Element. 

   PCE: Path Computation Element: an entity (component, application or 
   network node) that is capable of computing a network path or route 
   based on a network graph and applying computational constraints. 

   PCEP Peer: an element involved in a PCEP session (i.e. a PCC or the 
   PCE). 

   TE-Class: A pair consisting of a class-type and a preemption priority 
   allowed for that class type. An LSP transporting a Traffic Trunk from 
   that class type can use that preemption priority as the setup 
   priority, the holding priority, or both. 

   TE LSP: Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path. 

   Traffic Trunk: An aggregation of traffic flows of the same class 
   (i.e. treated equivalently from the DS-TE perspective) which is 
   placed inside a TE LSP.

3. CLASSTYPE Object 

   The CLASSTYPE object is optional and is used to specify the class-
   type of a TE LSP. This object is meaningful only within the path 
   computation request, and is ignored in the path reply message. If the 
   TE LSP for which the path is to be computed belongs to Class 0, the 
   path computation request MUST NOT contain the CLASSTYPE object. This 
   allows backward compatibility with PCE that does not support the 
   CLASSTYPE object. 

3.1. Object Definition 

   The CLASSTYPE object contains a 32-bit word PCEP common object header 
   defined in [PCEP-ID] followed by another 32-bit word object body as 
   shown in Figure 1. 

   0                   1                   2                   3 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |                       PCEP common header                      | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  |            Reserved                                     | CT  | 
  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
                   Figure 1 CLASSTYPE object format. 

   The fields in the object common header are processed as specified in 
   [PCEP-ID]. The values of object class and object type are 22 and 1 
   respectively. If included, CLASSTYPE object must be taken into 
   account by PCE. As such, the P flag MUST be set. I flag is ignored. 

   The CLASSTYPE object body contains the following fields: 

   CT: 3-bit field that indicates the class-type. Values allowed are 1, 
   2, ... , 7. Value of 0 is Reserved. 

   Reserved: 29-bit reserved field. It MUST be set to zero on 
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt. 

3.2. Path Computation Request message with CLASSTYPE Object 

   [PCEP-ID] specifies the object orders in which objects must be 
   inserted in the PCEP messages. This document specifies that the 
   CLASSTYPE object be inserted after the END-POINT objects as shown 
   below: 

   The format of a PCReq message is as follows:

      <PCReq Message>::= <Common Header> 
                         [<SVEC-list>] 
                         <request-list> 
      where: 
         <svec-list>::=<SVEC>[<svec-list>] 
         <request-list>::=<request>[<request-list>] 
         <request>::= <RP> 
                      <END-POINTS> 
                      [<CLASSTYPE>] 
                      [<LSPA>] 
                      [<BANDWIDTH>] 
                      [<metric-list>] 
                      [<RRO>] 
                      [<IRO>] 
                      [<LOAD-BALANCING>] 
      where: 
      <metric-list>::=<METRIC>[<metric-list>] 
    
   Note that an implementation MUST form the PCEP messages using the 
   object ordering rules specified using Backus-Naur Form. Please refer 
   [OBJ-ORD] for more details.  
    
3.3. Processing CLASSTYPE Object 

   If the LSP is associated with Class-Type N (1 <= N <= 7), the PCC 
   originating the path computation request MUST include the CLASSTYPE 
   object in the Path computation request message with the Class-Type 
   (CT) field set to N.  

   If a path computation request contains multiple CLASSTYPE objects, 
   only the first one is meaningful; subsequent CLASSTYPE object(s) MUST 
   be ignored and MUST NOT be forwarded. 

   If the CLASSTYPE object is not present in the path computation 
   request message, the LSR MUST associate the Class-Type 0 to the LSP. 

   Path computation reply message MUST NOT include a CLASSTYPE object. 
   If a PCE needs to forward a path computation request containing the 
   CLASSTYPE object to another PCE, it MUST store the class-type of the 
   TE LSP in order to complete the path computation when the path 
   computation reply arrives. 

   A PCE that does not recognize the CLASSTYPE object MUST reject the 
   entire PCEP message and MUST send a PCE error message with Error-
   Type="Unknown Object" or "Not supported Object" defined in [PCEP-ID]. 


 
 
Sivabalan                Expires May 3, 2009                   [Page 5] 
    
Internet-Draft        draft-ietf-pce-dste-02.txt          November 2008 
    

   A PCE that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object finds that P flag is not 
   set in the CLASSTYPE object, it MUST send PCE error message towards 
   the sender with the with the error type and error value specified in 
   [PCEP-ID]. 

   A PCE that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object, but does not support the 
   particular Class-Type, MUST send a PCE error message towards the 
   sender with the error type  "Diff-Serv aware TE Error" and the error 
   value of "Unsupported Class-Type" (new error code provided below). 

   A PCE that recognizes the CLASSTYPE object, but determines that the 
   Class-Type value is not valid (i.e., Class Type value 0), MUST send a 
   PCE error towards the sender with the error type "Diff-Serve aware TE 
   Error" and an error value of "Invalid Class-Type value" (new error 
   code provided below). 

3.4. Determination of Traffic Engineering Class (TE-Class) 

   As specified in RFC4124, a CT and a Preemption priority map to a 
   Traffic Engineering Class (TE-Class), and there can be up to 8 TE-
   classes. The TE-class value is used to determine the unreserved 
   bandwidth on the links during path computation. In the case of a PCE, 
   the CT value carried in the CLASSTYPE object and the setup priority 
   in the LSP Attribute (LSPA) object are used to determine the TE-class 
   corresponding to the path computation request. If LSPA object is 
   absent, the setup priority is assumed to be 0.  

3.5. Significance of Class-Type and TE-Class 

   To ensure coherent DS-TE operation, a PCE and a PCC should have a 
   common understanding of a particular DS-TE classtype and TE-Class.  
   If a path computation request crosses an AS boundary, these should 
   have global significance in all domains.  Enforcement of this global 
   significance is outside the scope of this document. 

3.6. Error Codes for CLASSTYPE Object 

   This document defines the following error type and values: 

   Error-Type    Meaning 

      12         Diff-Serve aware TE Error 
                 Error-value=1: unsupported class-type. 
                 Error-value=2: invalid class-type. 
                 Error-value=3: class-type and setup priority does not 
                 form a configured TE class.

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce new security issues.  The security 
   considerations pertaining to PCEP [PCEP-ID] remain relevant. 

5. IANA Considerations 

   IANA maintains a registry of parameters for PCEP. This contains a 
   sub-registry for PCEP objects. IANA is requested to make new 
   allocation from this registry as follows: 

   Object-Class     Name                  Reference 

       22           CLASSTYPE             draft-ietf-pce-dste-02.txt 

                      Object-Type   

                      1: Class Type       draft-ietf-pce-dste-02.txt   

   IANA is requested to make new allocation for error types and values 
   as follows: 

   Error-Type  Meaning                    Reference 

       12      Diff-Serv aware TE error   draft-ietf-pce-dste-02.txt 

               Error-value = 1:           draft-ietf-pce-dste-02.txt 

                 Unsupported class-type  

               Error-value = 2:           draft-ietf-pce-dste-02.txt 

                 Invalid class-type  

               Error-value = 3:           draft-ietf-pce-dste-02.txt 

                 Class type and setup priority  

                 does not form a configured TE class
