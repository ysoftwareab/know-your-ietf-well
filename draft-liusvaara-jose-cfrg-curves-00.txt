1.  Introduction

   Internet Research Task Force (IRTF) Crypto Forum Research Group
   (CFRG) selected new elliptic curves and signature algorithms for
   asymmetric key cryptography.  This document defines how those curves
   and algorithms are to be used in JOSE in interoperable manner.

   This extends [RFC7517] and [RFC7518]

1.1.  Requirements Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft     CFRG curves and signatures in JOSE      December 2015


1.2.  Notation

   All inputs to and outputs from the the ECDH and signature functions
   are defined to be octet strings, with the exception of output of
   verfication function, which is a boolean.

2.  Key type 'OKP'

   A new key type (kty) value "OKP" (Octet Key Pair) is defined for
   public key algorithms that use octet strings as private and public
   keys.  It has the following parameters:

   o  The parameter "kty" MUST be "OKP".

   o  The parameter "crv" MUST be present, and contain the subtype of
      the key (from "JSON Web Elliptic curve" registry).

   o  The parameter "x" MUST be present, and contain the public key
      encoded using base64url [RFC4648] encoding.

   o  The parameter "d" MUST be present for private keys, and contain
      the private key encoded using base64url encoding.  This parameter
      MUST NOT be present for public keys.

   Note: Do not assume that there is an underlying elliptic curve,
   despite the existence of the "crv" and "x" parameters.

   When calculating thumbprints [RFC7638], the three public key fields
   are included in the hash.  That is, in lexographic order: "crv",
   "kty" and "x".

3.  Algorithms

3.1.  Signatures

3.1.1.  Algorithms

   The following signature algorithms are defined here (to be applied as
   values of "alg" parameter).  All these have keys with subtype of the
   same name:

     alg value:  subtype:     The algorithm:
     Ed25519     Ed25519      Ed25519
     Ed25519ph   Ed25519ph    Ed25519ph
     Ed448       Ed448        Ed448
     Ed448ph     Ed448ph      Ed448ph

Internet-Draft     CFRG curves and signatures in JOSE      December 2015


   The key type for these keys is "OKP" and key subtype for these
   algorithms MUST be the same as the algorithm name.

   The keys of these subtypes MUST NOT be used for ECDH-ES.

   [TBD: Merge the alg values into a single one that can perform signing
   with any signature-capable OKP subtype?  That would remove a source
   of possible errors, since then the message and key could not mismatch
   in algorithm.]

3.1.2.  Signing

   Signing for these is preformed by applying the signing algorithm
   defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] to the private key (as private key),
   public key (as public key) and the JWS Signing Input (as message).
   The resulting signature is the JWS Signature value.  All inputs and
   outputs are octet strings.

3.1.3.  Verification

   Verification is performed by applying the verification algorithm
   defined in [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] to the public key (as public key),
   the JWS Signing Input (as message) and the JWS Signature value (as
   signature).  All inputs are octet strings.  If the algorithm accepts,
   the signature is valid, otherwise it is invalid.

3.2.  ECDH-ES

   The following key subtypes defined here for purpose of ECDH-ES:

      subtype:          ECDH Function:
      X25519            X25519
      X448              X448

   The key type used with these keys is "OKP".  These subtypes MUST NOT
   be used for signing.

3.2.1.  Performing the ECDH operation

   The "x" parameter of "epk" field is set as follows:

   Apply the appropriate ECDH function to the ephemeral private key (as
   scalar input) and the standard basepoint (as u-coordinate input).
   The output is the value for "x" parameter of "epk" field.  All inputs
   and outputs are octet strings.

   The Z value (raw key agreement output) for key agreement is
   determined as follows:

Internet-Draft     CFRG curves and signatures in JOSE      December 2015


   Apply the appropriate ECDH function to the ephemeral private key (as
   scalar input) and receiver public key (as u-coordinate input).  The
   output is the Z value.  All inputs and outputs are octet strings.

4.  Security considerations

   Security considerations from [I-D.irtf-cfrg-curves] and
   [I-D.irtf-cfrg-eddsa] apply here.

   Some algorithms interact in bad ways (e.g.  "Ed25519" and
   "Ed25519ph").  For this reason, those algorithms have different
   subtypes, so keys for each are not mixed up.

   Do not separate key material from information what key algorithm
   group it is for.  When using keys, check that the algorithm is
   compatible with the key algorithm group for the key.  To do otherwise
   opens system up to attacks via mixing up algorithms.  It is
   practicularly dangerous to mix up signature and MAC algorithms.

   Do not assume that signature also binds the key used for signing, it
   does not (there are also other widespread signature algorithms where
   this binding fails, as such binding is not part of the definition of
   secure signature primitive).  As an example of such failure, the
   Ed25519ph signature of X under key (Ed25519ph,Y) is identical to
   Ed25519 signature of SHA512(X) under key (Ed25519,Y).  And often it
   takes only setting a few bits of message (easy to do by brute force)
   to make the message valid enough to be processed in some very
   surprising way.

   If key generation or batch signature verification is performed, a
   well-seed cryptographical random number generator is REQUIRED.
   Signing and non-batch signature verification are deterministic
   operations and do not need random numbers of any kind.

A.1.  Ed25519 private key

   {"kty":"OKP","crv":"Ed25519",
   "d":"nWGxne_9WmC6hEr0kuwsxERJxWl7MmkZcDusAxyuf2A"
   "x":"11qYAYKxCrfVS_7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo"}

   The hexadecimal dump of private key is:

   9d 61 b1 9d ef fd 5a 60 ba 84 4a f4 92 ec 2c c4
   44 49 c5 69 7b 32 69 19 70 3b ac 03 1c ae 7f 60

   And of the public key:

   d7 5a 98 01 82 b1 0a b7 d5 4b fe d3 c9 64 07 3a
   0e e1 72 f3 da a6 23 25 af 02 1a 68 f7 07 51 1a

A.2.  Ed25519 public key

   This is the public parts of the previous private key (just omits
   "d"):

   {"kty":"OKP","crv":"Ed25519",
   "x":"11qYAYKxCrfVS_7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwIaaPcHURo"}

A.3.  JWK thumbprint canonicalization

   The JWK thumbprint canonicalization of the two above examples is
   (linebreak inserted for formatting reasons)

   {"crv":"Ed25519","kty":"OKP","x":"11qYAYKxCrfVS_7TyWQHOg7hcvPapiMlrwI
   aaPcHURo"}

   Which has the SHA-256 hash of:
   90facafea9b1556698540f70c0117a22ea37bd5cf3ed3c47093c1707282b4b89

A.4.  Ed25519 Signing

   The JWS protected header is:

   {"alg":"Ed25519"}

   This has base64url encoding of:

   eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5In0

   The payload is (text):

   Example of Ed25519 signing

Internet-Draft     CFRG curves and signatures in JOSE      December 2015


   This has base64url encoding of:

   RXhhbXBsZSBvZiBFZDI1NTE5IHNpZ25pbmc

   The JWS signing input is (concatenation of base64url encoding of the
   (protected) header, a dot and base64url encoding of the payload) is:

   eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5In0.RXhhbXBsZSBvZiBFZDI1NTE5IHNpZ25pbmc

   Applying Ed25519 signing algorithm to the private key, public key and
   the JWS signing input yields signature (hex):

   53 18 48 60 b1 c6 83 7f 4d 54 22 e9 40 05 43 fd
   47 1f 3a 69 c6 48 2c cb 15 9a 17 62 42 e2 21 b1
   5c 72 63 9b fe a3 9b b2 08 f3 2c ab 1f 27 0f b8
   36 57 1c 52 0b d8 ac 41 eb 45 b3 55 d0 77 19 01

   Converting this to base64url yields:

   UxhIYLHGg39NVCLpQAVD_UcfOmnGSCzLFZoXYkLiIbFccmOb_qObsgjzLKsfJw-4NlccU
   gvYrEHrRbNV0HcZAQ

   So the compact serialization of JWS is (concatenation of signing
   input, a dot and base64url encoding of the signature:

   eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5In0.RXhhbXBsZSBvZiBFZDI1NTE5IHNpZ25pbmc.UxhIYLHGg
   39NVCLpQAVD_UcfOmnGSCzLFZoXYkLiIbFccmOb_qObsgjzLKsfJw-4NlccUgvYrEHrRb
   NV0HcZAQ

A.5.  Ed25519 Validation

   The JWS from above example is:

   eyJhbGciOiJFZDI1NTE5In0.RXhhbXBsZSBvZiBFZDI1NTE5IHNpZ25pbmc.UxhIYLHGg
   39NVCLpQAVD_UcfOmnGSCzLFZoXYkLiIbFccmOb_qObsgjzLKsfJw-4NlccUgvYrEHrRb
   NV0HcZAQ

   This has 2 dots in it, so it might be valid JWS.  Base64url decoding
   the protected header yields:

   {"alg":"Ed25519"}

   So this is Ed25519 signature.  Now the key has: "kty":"OKP" and
   "crv":"Ed25519", so the key is valid for the algorithm (if it had
   other values, the validation would have failed).

   Applying Ed25519 verification algorithm to the public key, JWS
   signing input and the signature yields true.  So the signature is
   valid.  The message is base64 decoding of the part between the dots:

   Example of Ed25519 signing

A.6.  ECDH-ES with X25519

   The public key to encrypt to is:

   {"kty":"OKP","crv":"X25519","kid":"Bob"
   "x":"3p7bfXt9wbTTW2HC7OQ1Nz-DQ8hbeGdNrfx-FG-IK08"}

   The public key from target key is (hex):

   de 9e db 7d 7b 7d c1 b4 d3 5b 61 c2 ec e4 35 37
   3f 83 43 c8 5b 78 67 4d ad fc 7e 14 6f 88 2b 4f

   The ephemeral secret happens to be (hex):

   77 07 6d 0a 73 18 a5 7d 3c 16 c1 72 51 b2 66 45
   df 4c 2f 87 eb c0 99 2a b1 77 fb a5 1d b9 2c 2a

   So the ephemeral public key is X25519(ephkey,G) (hex):

   85 20 f0 09 89 30 a7 54 74 8b 7d dc b4 3e f7 5a
   0d bf 3a 0d 26 38 1a f4 eb a4 a9 8e aa 9b 4e 6a

   This is packed into ephemeral public key value:

   {"kty":"OKP","crv":"X25519",
   "x":"hSDwCYkwp1R0i33ctD73Wg2_Og0mOBr066SpjqqbTmo"}

   So the protected header could for example be:

   {"alg":"ECDH-ES+A128KW","epk":{"kty":"OKP","crv":"X25519",
   "x":"hSDwCYkwp1R0i33ctD73Wg2_Og0mOBr066SpjqqbTmo"},
   "enc":"A128GCM","kid":"Bob"}

   And sender computes as the DH Z value as X25519(ephkey,recv_pub)
   (hex):

   4a 5d 9d 5b a4 ce 2d e1 72 8e 3b f4 80 35 0f 25
   e0 7e 21 c9 47 d1 9e 33 76 f0 9b 3c 1e 16 17 42

   The receiver computes as the DH Z value as X25519(seckey,ephkey_pub)
   (hex):

   4a 5d 9d 5b a4 ce 2d e1 72 8e 3b f4 80 35 0f 25
   e0 7e 21 c9 47 d1 9e 33 76 f0 9b 3c 1e 16 17 42

   Which is the same as sender's value (the both sides run this through
   KDF before using as AES128-KW key).

A.7.  ECDH-ES with X448

   The public key to encrypt to is (linebreak inserted for formatting
   reasons):

   {"kty":"OKP","crv":"X448","kid":"Dave"
   "x":"PreoKbDNIPW8_AtZm2_sz22kYnEHvbDU80W0MCfYuXL8PjT7QjKhPKcG3LV67D2
   uB73BxnvzNgk"}

   The public key from target key is (hex):

   3e b7 a8 29 b0 cd 20 f5 bc fc 0b 59 9b 6f ec cf
   6d a4 62 71 07 bd b0 d4 f3 45 b4 30 27 d8 b9 72
   fc 3e 34 fb 42 32 a1 3c a7 06 dc b5 7a ec 3d ae
   07 bd c1 c6 7b f3 36 09

   The ephemeral secret happens to be (hex):

   9a 8f 49 25 d1 51 9f 57 75 cf 46 b0 4b 58 00 d4
   ee 9e e8 ba e8 bc 55 65 d4 98 c2 8d d9 c9 ba f5
   74 a9 41 97 44 89 73 91 00 63 82 a6 f1 27 ab 1d
   9a c2 d8 c0 a5 98 72 6b

   So the ephemeral public key is X448(ephkey,G) (hex):

   9b 08 f7 cc 31 b7 e3 e6 7d 22 d5 ae a1 21 07 4a
   27 3b d2 b8 3d e0 9c 63 fa a7 3d 2c 22 c5 d9 bb
   c8 36 64 72 41 d9 53 d4 0c 5b 12 da 88 12 0d 53
   17 7f 80 e5 32 c4 1f a0

   This is packed into ephemeral public key value (linebreak inserted
   for formatting purposes):

   {"kty":"OKP","crv":"X448",
   "x":"mwj3zDG34-Z9ItWuoSEHSic70rg94Jxj-qc9LCLF2bvINmRyQdlT1AxbEtqIEg1
   TF3-A5TLEH6A"}

   So the protected header could for example be (linebreak inserted for
   formatting purposes):
