Internet-Draft               SIP-H.323 Req.                February 2004


1. Introduction

   The SIP-H.323 Interworking function (IWF) converts between SIP
   (Session Initiation Protocol) [RFC3261] and the ITU Recommendation
   H.323 protocol [H.323].  This document describes requirements for
   this protocol conversion.

3. Definitions

   H.323 gatekeeper (GK): An H.323 gatekeeper is an optional component
      in an H.323 network.  If it is present, it performs address
      translation, bandwidth control, admission control and zone
      management.

   H.323 network: In this document, we refer to the collection of all
      H.323-speaking components as the H.323 network.

   SIP network: In this document, we refer to the collection of all SIP
      servers and user agents as the SIP network.

   Interworking Function (IWF): The Interworking Function (IWF) performs
      interworking between H.323 and SIP.  It belongs to both the H.323
      and SIP networks.

   SIP server: A SIP server can be either a SIP proxy, redirect server,
      or registrar server.

   Endpoint: An endpoint can call and be called.  An endpoint is an
      entity from which the media such as voice, video or fax originates
      or terminates.  An endpoint can be H.323 terminal, H.323 Gateway,
      H.323 MCU [H.323] or SIP user agent (UA) [RFC3261].

   Media Switching Fabric (MSF): The Media Switching Fabric (MSF) is an
      optional logical entity within the IWF.  The MSF switches media
      such as voice, video or fax from one network association to
      another.

4. Functionality within the SIP-H.323 IWF

   This section summarizes the functional requirements of the SIP-H.323
   interworking function (IWF).

   A SIP-H.323 IWF MAY be integrated into an H.323 gatekeeper or SIP
   server.  Interworking SHOULD NOT require any optional components in
   either the SIP or H.323 network, such as H.323 gatekeepers.  IWF
   redundancy in the network is beyond the scope of this document.

   An IWF contain functions from the following list, inter alia:

   o  Mapping of the call setup and teardown sequences;

   o  Registering H.323 and SIP endpoints with SIP registrars and H.323
      gatekeepers;

   o  Resolving H.323 and SIP addresses;

   o  Maintaining the H.323 and SIP state machines;

   o  Negotiating terminal capabilities;

   o  Opening and closing media channels;

   o  Mapping media coding algorithms for H.323 and SIP networks;

   o  Reserving and releasing call-related resources;

   o  Processing of mid-call signaling messages;

   o  Handling of services and features.

   The IWF SHOULD NOT process media.  We assume that the same media
   transport protocols, such as RTP, are used in both the SIP and H.323
   network.  Thus, media packets are exchanged directly between the
   endpoints.  If a particular service requires the IWF to handle media,
   we assume that the IWF simply forwards media packets without
   modification from one network to the other, using a media switching
   fabric (MSF). The conversion of media from one encoding or format to
   another is out of scope for SIP-H.323 protocol translation.

5. Pre-Call Requirements

   The IWF function MAY use a translation table to resolve the H.323 and
   SIP addresses to IP addresses.  This translation table can be updated
   by using a H.323 gatekeeper, SIP proxy server or a locally-maintained
   database.

5.1 Registration with H.323 Gatekeeper

   An IWF MAY provide and update the H.323 gatekeeper with the addresses
   of SIP UAs.  A SIP user agent can make itself known to the H.323
   network by registering with an IWF serving as a registrar.  The IWF
   creates an H.323 alias address and registers this alias together with
   its own network address with the appropriate GK.

   The gatekeeper can then use this information to route calls to SIP
   UAs via the IWF, without being aware that the endpoint is not a
   "native" H.323 endpoint.

   The IWF can register SIP UAs with one or more H.323 gatekeepers.

5.2 Registration with SIP Server

   The IWF can provide information about H.323 endpoints to a SIP
   registrar.  This allows the SIP proxy using this SIP registrar to
   direct calls to the H.323 end points via the IWF.

   The IWF can easily obtain information about H.323 endpoints if it
   also serves as a gatekeeper.  Other architectures require further
   study.

   If the H.323 endpoints are known through E.164 (telephone number)
   addresses, the IWF can use IGREP [I-D.ietf-iptel-tgrep] or SLP
   [I-D.zhao-iptel-gwloc-slp] to inform the SIP proxy server of these
   endpoints.

   The IWF only needs to register with multiple SIP registrars if the
   H.323 terminal is to appear under multiple, different
   addresses-of-record.

Internet-Draft               SIP-H.323 Req.                February 2004


6. General Interworking Requirements

   The IWF SHOULD use H.323 Version 2 or later and SIP according to RFC
   3261 [RFC3261].  The protocol translation function MUST NOT require
   modifications or additions to either H.323 or SIP.  However, it may
   not be possible to support certain features of each protocol across
   the IWF.

6.1 Basic Call Requirements

6.1.1 General Requirements

   The IWF SHOULD provide default settings for translation parameters.
   The IWF specification MUST identify these defaults.

   The IWF MUST release any call-related resource at the end of a call.
   SIP session timers [I-D.ietf-sip-session-timer] MAY be used on the
   SIP side.

6.1.2 Address Resolution

   The IWF SHOULD support all the addressing schemes in H.323, including
   the H.323 URI [RFC3508], and the "sip", "sips" and "tel" URI schemes
   in SIP.  It SHOULD support the DNS-based SIP server location
   mechanisms described in [RFC3263] and H.323 Annex O, which details
   how H.323 uses DNS and, in particular, DNS SRV records.

   The IWF SHOULD register with the H.323 Gatekeeper and the SIP
   registrar when available.

   The IWF MAY use any means to translate between SIP and H.323
   addresses.  Examples include translation tables populated by the
   gatekeeper, SIP registrar or other database, LDAP, DNS or TRIP.

6.1.3 Call with H.323 Gatekeeper

   When an H.323 GK is present in the network, the IWF SHOULD resolve
   addresses with the help of the GK.

6.1.4 Call with SIP Registrar

   The IWF applies normal SIP call routing and does not need to be aware
   whether there is a proxy server or not.

6.1.5 Capability Negotiation

   The IWF SHOULD NOT make any assumptions about the capabilities of
   either the SIP user agent or the H.323 terminal.  However, it MAY



Schulzrinne & Agboh     Expires August 15, 2004                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft               SIP-H.323 Req.                February 2004


   indicate a guaranteed-to-be-supported list of codecs of the H.323
   terminal or SIP user agent before exchanging capabilities with H.323
   (using H.245) and SIP (using SDP [RFC2327]).  H.323 defines mandatory
   capabilities, SIP currently does not.  For example, the G.711 audio
   codec is mandatory for higher bandwidth H.323 networks.

   The IWF SHOULD attempt to map the capability descriptors of H.323 and
   SDP in the best possible fashion.  The algorithm for finding the best
   mapping between H.245 capability descriptors and the corresponding
   SDP is left for further study.

   The IWF SHOULD be able to map the common audio, video and application
   format names supported in H.323 to and from the equivalent RTP/AVP
   [RFC3550] names.

   The IWF MAY use the SIP OPTIONS message to derive SIP UA
   capabilities.  It MAY support mid-call renegotiation of media
   capabilities.

6.1.6 Opening of Logical Channels

   The IWF SHOULD support the seamless exchange of messages for opening,
   reopening, changing and closing of media channels during a call.  The
   procedures for opening, reopening, closing, and changing the existing
   media sessions during a call are for further study.

   The IWF SHOULD open media channels between the endpoints whenever
   possible.  If this is not possible, then the channel can be opened at
   the MSF of the IWF.

   The IWF SHOULD support unidirectional, symmetric bi-directional, and
   asymmetric bi-directional opening of channels.

   The IWF MAY respond to the mode request, to the request for reopening
   and changing an existing logical channel and MAY support the flow
   control mechanism in H.323.

6.2 IWF H.323 Features

   The IWF SHOULD support Fast Connect, H.245 tunneling in H.323 Setup
   messages.  If IWF and GK are the same device, pre-granted ARQ SHOULD
   be supported.  If pre-granted ARQ is supported, the IWF MAY perform
   the address resolution from H.323 GK using the LRQ/LCF exchange.

6.3 Overlapped Sending

   An IWF SHOULD follow the recommendations outlined in
   [I-D.ietf-sipping-overlap] when receiving overlapped digits from the

   H.323 side.  If the IWF receives overlapped dialed digits from the
   SIP network, it MAY use the Q.931 Setup, Setup Ack and Information
   Message in H.323.

   The IWF MAY support the transfer of digits during a call by using the
   appropriate SIP mechanism and UserInputIndication in H.245 (H.323).

7. Transport

   The H.323 and SIP systems do not have to be in close proximity.  The
   IP networks hosting the H.323 and SIP systems do not need to assure
   quality-of-service (QOS).  In particular, the IWF SHOULD NOT assume
   that signaling messages have priority over packets from other
   applications. H.323 signaling over UDP (H.323 Annex E) is optional.

8. Mapping between SIP and H.323

8.1 General Requirements

   o  The call message sequence of both protocols MUST be maintained.

   o  The IWF MUST NOT set up or tear down calls on its own.

   o  Signaling messages that do not have a match for the destination
      protocol SHOULD be terminated on the IWF, with the IWF taking the
      appropriate action for them.  For example, SIP allows a SIP UA to
      silently discard an ACK request for a non-existent call leg.

   o  If the IWF is required to generate a message on its own, IWF
      SHOULD use pre-configured default values for the message
      parameters.

   o  The information elements and header fields of the respective
      messages are to be converted as follows:

      *  The contents of connection-specific information elements, such
         as Call Reference Value for H.323, is converted to similar
         information required by SIP or SDP such as the SDP session ID
         and the SIP 'Call-ID'.

      *  The IWF generates protocol elements that are not available from
         the other side.


8.2 H.225.0 and SIP Call Signaling

   o  The IWF MUST conform to the call signaling procedures recommended
      for the SIP side regardless of the behavior of the H.323 elements.

   o  The IWF MUST conform to the call signaling procedures recommended
      for the H.323 side regardless of the behavior of the SIP elements.

   o  The IWF serves as the endpoint for the Q.931 Call Signaling
      Channel to either an H.323 endpoint or H.323 Gatekeeper (in case
      of GK routed signaling).  The IWF also acts as a SIP user agent
      client and server.

   o  The IWF also establishes a RAS Channel to the H.323 GK, if
      available.

   o  The IWF SHOULD process messages for H.323 supplementary services
      (FACILITY, NOTIFY, and the INFORMATION messages) only if the
      service itself is supported.

Internet-Draft               SIP-H.323 Req.                February 2004


8.3 Call Sequence

   The call sequence on both sides SHOULD be maintained in such a way
   that neither H.323 terminal nor SIP UA is aware of presence of the
   IWF.

8.4 State Machine Requirements

   The state machine for IWF will follow the following general
   guidelines:

   o  Unexpected messages in a particular state shall be treated as
      "error" messages.

   o  All messages which do not change the state shall be treated as
      "non-triggering" or informational messages.

   o  All messages which expect a change in state shall be treated as
      "triggering" messages.

   For each state, an IWF specification MUST classify all possible
   protocol messages into the above three categories.  It MUST specify
   the actions taken on the content of the message and the resulting
   state. Below, is an example of such a table:

   State: Idle

   Possible Messages   Message Category   Action         Next state
   -------------------------------------------------------------------
   All RAS msg.        Triggering         Add Reg.Info.  WaitForSetup
   All H.245 msg.      Error              Send 4xx       Idle
   SIP OPTIONS         Non Triggering     Return cap.    Idle
   SIP INVITE          Triggering         Send SETUP     WaitForConnect

9. Security Considerations

   The IWF SHOULD use normal H.323 and SIP security mechanisms.

   The IWF MUST implement procedures to avoid becoming the source of
   denial-of-service attacks.

10. Examples and Scenarios

10.1 Introduction

   We present some examples of call scenarios that will show the
   signaling messages received and transmitted.  The following
   situations can occur:

   o  Some signaling messages can be translated one-to-one.

   o  In some cases, parameters on one side do not match those on the
      other side.

   o  Some signaling messages do not have an equivalent message on the
      other side.  In some cases, the IWF can gather further information
      and the signal on the other side.  In some cases, only an error
      indication can be provided.


10.2 IWF Configurations

   Below are some common architectures involving an IWF:

   Basic Configuration: H.323 EP  -- IWF -- SIP UA

   Calls using H.323 GK: H.323 EP -- H.323 GK -- IWF -- SIP UA

   Calls using SIP proxies: H.323 EP -- IWF -- SIP proxies -- SIP UA

   Calls using both H.323 GK and SIP proxy: H.323 EP -- H.323 GK -- IWF
      -- SIP proxies -- SIP UA

   SIP trunking between H.323 networks: H.323 EP -- IWF -- SIP network
      -- IWF -- H.323 EP

   H.323 trunking between SIP networks: SIP EP -- IWF -- H.323 network
      -- IWF -- SIP UA


10.3 Call Flows

   Some call flow examples for two different configurations and call
   scenarios are given below.
