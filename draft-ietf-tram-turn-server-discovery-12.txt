                       TURN Server Auto Discovery
                draft-ietf-tram-turn-server-discovery-12

Abstract

   Current Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN) server discovery
   mechanisms are relatively static and limited to explicit
   configuration.  These are usually under the administrative control of
   the application or TURN service provider, and not the enterprise,
   ISP, or the network in which the client is located.  Enterprises and
   ISPs wishing to provide their own TURN servers need auto discovery
   mechanisms that a TURN client could use with no or minimal
   configuration.  This document describes three such mechanisms for
   TURN server discovery.

   This draft updates [RFC5766] to relax the requirement for mutual
   authentication in certain cases.

1.  Introduction

   TURN [RFC5766] is a protocol that is often used to improve the
   connectivity of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) applications (as defined in
   section 2.7 of [RFC5128]).  TURN allows a connection to be
   established when one or both sides are incapable of a direct P2P
   connection.  It is an important building block for interactive, real-
   time communication using audio, video, collaboration etc.

   While TURN services are extensively used today, the means to auto
   discover TURN servers do not exist.  TURN clients are usually
   explicitly configured with a well known TURN server.  To allow TURN
   applications to operate seamlessly across different types of networks
   and encourage the use of TURN without the need for manual
   configuration, it is important that there exists an auto discovery
   mechanism for TURN services.  Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC)
   [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] usages and related extensions, which are
   mostly based on web applications, need TURN server discovery
   mechanisms.

   This document describes three discovery mechanisms, so as to maximize
   opportunity for discovery, based on the network in which the TURN
   client finds itself.  The three discovery mechanisms are:

   o  A resolution mechanism based on straightforward Naming Authority
      Pointer (S-NAPTR) resource records in the Domain Name System
      (DNS).  [RFC5928] describes details on retrieving a list of server
      transport addresses from DNS that can be used to create a TURN
      allocation.

   o  DNS Service Discovery

   o  A mechanism based on anycast address for TURN.

   In general, if a client wishes to communicate using one of its
   interfaces using a specific IP address family, it SHOULD query the
   TURN server(s) that has been discovered for that specific interface
   and address family.  How to select an interface and IP address family
   is out of the scope of this document.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

3.  Discovery Procedure

   TURN clients, by default, discover TURN server(s) by means of local
   or manual TURN configuration (i.e., TURN servers configured at the
   system level).  Configuration discovered from an application, e.g., a
   Java Script specified TURN server for Web Real-Time Communication
   (WebRTC) [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] usages and related extensions, is
   considered as local configuration.  An implementation may give the
   user an opportunity (e.g., by means of configuration file options or
   menu items) to specify a TURN server for each address family.  A

   client can choose auto-discovery in the absence of local
   configuration, if local configuration doesn't work or in addition to
   local configuration.  This document does not offer a recommendation
   on server selection.

   A TURN client that implements the auto discovery algorithm, to
   discover TURN servers in the attached network, uses the following
   mechanisms for discovery:

   o  Service Resolution : The TURN client attempts to perform TURN
      service resolution using the host's DNS domain.

   o  DNS SD: DNS Service Discovery.

   o  Anycast : Send TURN allocate request to the assigned TURN anycast
      request for each combination of interface and address family.

   Not all TURN servers may be discovered using NAPTR records or DNS SD;
   Similarly, not all TURN servers may support anycast.  For best
   results, a client SHOULD implement all discovery mechanisms described
   above.

   The document does not prescribe a strict order that a client must
   follow for discovery.  An implementation may choose to perform all
   the above steps in parallel for discovery OR choose to follow any
   desired order and stop the discovery procedure if a mechanism
   succeeds.

   On hosts with more than one interface or address family (IPv4/v6),
   the TURN server discovery procedure has to be performed for each
   combination of interface and address family.  A client MAY choose to
   perform the discovery procedure only for a desired interface/address
   combination if the client does not wish to discover a TURN server for
   all combinations of interface and address family.

4.  Discovery using Service Resolution

   This mechanism is performed in two steps:

   1.  A DNS domain name is retrieved for each combination of interface
   and address family.

   2.  Retrieved DNS domain names are then used for S-NAPTR lookups as
   per [RFC5928].  Further DNS lookups may be necessary to determine
   TURN server IP address(es).

4.1.  Retrieving Domain Name

   A client has to determine the domain in which it is located.  The
   following sections provide two possible mechanisms to learn the
   domain name, but other means of retrieving domain names may be used,
   which are outside the scope of this document e.g. local
   configuration.

   Implementations may allow the user to specify a default name that is
   used if no specific name has been configured.

4.1.1.  DHCP

   DHCP can be used to determine the domain name related to an
   interface's point of network attachment.  Network operators may
   provide the domain name to be used for service discovery within an
   access network using DHCP.  Sections 3.2 and 3.3 of [RFC5986] define
   DHCP IPv4 and IPv6 access network domain name options,
   OPTION_V4_ACCESS_DOMAIN and OPTION_V6_ACCESS_DOMAIN respectively, to
   identify a domain name that is suitable for service discovery within
   the access network.

   For IPv4, the discovery procedure MUST request the access network
   domain name option in a Parameter Request List option, as described
   in [RFC2131].  [RFC2132] defines the DHCP IPv4 domain name option;
   while this option is less suitable, a client MAY request for it if
   the access network domain name defined in [RFC5986] is not available.

   For IPv6, the discovery procedure MUST request for the access network
   domain name option in an Options Request Option (ORO) within an
   Information-request message, as described in [RFC3315].

   If neither option can be retrieved the procedure fails for this
   interface.  If a result can be retrieved it will be used as an input
   for S-NAPTR resolution.

4.1.2.  From own Identity

   For a TURN client with an understanding of the protocol mechanics of
   calling applications, the client may wish to extract the domain name
   from its own identity i.e canonical identifier used to reach the
   user.

   Example

   SIP      : 'sip:alice@example.com'
   Bare JID : 'alice@example.com'
   email    : 'alice@example.com'

   'example.com' is retrieved from the above examples.

   A client may support multiple users, potentially with different
   domains, or for a single user to use different domains for different
   services.  The means to choose and extract the domain name may be
   different based on the type of identifier, service being used etc.,
   which are outside the scope of this document.

4.2.  Resolution

   Once the TURN discovery procedure has retrieved domain names, the
   resolution mechanism described in [RFC5928] is followed.  An S-NAPTR
   lookup with 'RELAY' application service and the desired protocol tag
   is made to obtain information necessary to connect to the
   authoritative TURN server within the given domain.

   If no TURN-specific S-NAPTR records can be retrieved, the discovery
   procedure fails for this domain name (and the corresponding interface
   and IP protocol version).  If more domain names are known, the
   discovery procedure may perform the corresponding S-NAPTR lookups
   immediately.  However, before retrying a lookup that has failed, a
   client must wait a time period that is appropriate for the
   encountered error (NXDOMAIN, timeout, etc.).

5.  DNS Service Discovery

   DNS-based Service Discovery (DNS-SD) [RFC6763] and Multicast DNS
   (mDNS) [RFC6762] provide generic solutions for discovering services
   available in a local network.  DNS-SD/mDNS define a set of naming
   rules for certain DNS record types that they use for advertising and
   discovering services.

   Section 4.1 of [RFC6763] specifies that a service instance name in
   DNS-SD has the following structure:

   <Instance> . <Service> . <Domain>

   The <Domain> portion specifies the DNS sub-domain where the service
   instance is registered.  It may be "local.", indicating the mDNS
   local domain, or it may be a conventional domain name such as
   "example.com.".  The <Service> portion of the TURN service instance

Internet-Draft            TURN server auto disc             January 2017


   name MUST be "_turn._udp" or "_turn._tcp" or "_turns._udp" or
   "_turns._tcp", as introduced in [RFC5766].

5.1.  mDNS

   A TURN client can proactively discover TURN servers being advertised
   in the site by multicasting a PTR query to one or all of the
   following:

   o  "_turn._udp.local."

   o  "_turn._tcp.local"

   o  "_turns._udp.local."

   o  "_turns._tcp.local"

   A TURN server can send out gratuitous multicast DNS answer packets
   whenever it starts up, wakes from sleep, or detects a change in
   network configuration.  TURN clients receive these gratuitous packets
   and cache information contained in it.

6.  Discovery using Anycast

   IP anycast can also be used for TURN service discovery.  A packet
   sent to an anycast address is delivered to the "topologically
   nearest" network interface with the anycast address.  Using the TURN
   anycast address, the only two things that need to be deployed in the
   network for discovery are the two things that actually use TURN.

   When a client requires TURN services, it sends a TURN allocate
   request to the assigned anycast address.  A TURN anycast server
   performs checks 1 to 7 discussed in Section 6.2 of [RFC5766].  If all
   checks pass, the TURN anycast server MUST respond with a 300 (Try
   Alternate) error as described in Section 2.9 of [RFC5766]; The
   response contains the TURN unicast address in the ALTERNATE-SERVER
   attribute.  For subsequent communication with the TURN server, the
   client uses the responding server's unicast address.  This has to be
   done because two packets addressed to an anycast address may reach
   two different anycast servers.  The client, thus, also needs to
   ensure that the initial request fits in a single packet.  An
   implementation may choose to send out every new TURN Allocation
   request to the anycast address to discover the closest and the most
   optimal unicast address for the TURN server.

7.  Deployment Considerations

7.1.  Mobility and Changing IP addresses

   A change of IP address on an interface may invalidate the result of
   the TURN server discovery procedure.  For instance, if the IP address
   assigned to a mobile host changes due to host mobility, it may be
   required to re-run the TURN server discovery procedure without
   relying on earlier gained information.  New requests should be made
   to the newly learned TURN servers learned after TURN discovery re-
   run.  However, if an earlier learned TURN server is still accessible
   using the new IP address, procedures described for mobility using
   TURN defined in [I-D.ietf-tram-turn-mobility] can be used for ongoing
   streams.

7.2.  Recursively Encapsulated TURN

   WebRTC endpoints SHOULD treat any TURN server discovered through the
   mechanisms described in this specification as an enterprise/gateway
   or access network server, in accordance with Recursively Encapsulated
   TURN [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-return].

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  IPv4 Anycast

   IANA has assigned a single IPv4 address from the 192.0.0.0/24 prefix
   and registered it in the "IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry"
   [RFC6890].

9.  Security Considerations

   Use of Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN) [RFC5389]
   authentication is OPTIONAL for TURN servers provided by the local
   network or by the access network.  A network provided TURN server MAY
   be configured to accept Allocation requests without STUN
   authentication, and a TURN client MAY be configured to accept
   Allocation success responses without STUN authentication from a
   network provided TURN server.

   Making STUN authentication optional is a downgrade of a MUST level
   requirement defined in [RFC5766].  The downgrade allows TURN servers
   provided by local or access network to accept Allocation requests
   from new and/or guest users in the network who do not necessarily
   possess long term credentials for STUN authentication.  The
   intention, in such deployments, being to provide TURN services to all
   users in the local or access network.  However, this opens up a TURN
   server to a variety of attacks described in Section 17 of [RFC5766].
   A TURN server in such cases must be configured to only process STUN
   requests from the trusted local network or subscribers of the access
   network.  Operational measures must be taken in order protect the
   TURN server; some of these measures include, but not limited to,
   access control by means of access-lists, firewalls, subscriber quota
   limits, ingress filtering etc.

   A TURN client in the absence of STUN long-term credential mechanism
   [RFC5389] or STUN Extension for Third-Party Authorization [RFC7635]

   MUST use (D)TLS unless it trusts the network infrastructure to defend
   against attacks discussed in [RFC5766].  It is RECOMMENDED that the
   TURN client use one of the following techniques with (D)TLS to
   validate the TURN server:

   o  For certificate-based authentication, a pre-populated trust anchor
      store [RFC6024] allows a TURN client to perform path validation
      for the server certificate obtained during the (D)TLS handshake.
      If the client used a domain name to discover the TURN server, that
      domain name also provides a mechanism for validation of the TURN
      server.  The client MUST use the rules and guidelines given in
      section 6 of [RFC6125] to validate the TURN server identity.

   o  Certification authorities that issue TURN server certificates
      SHOULD support the CN-ID, DNS-ID, SRV-ID and URI-ID identifier
      types.  TURN service providers SHOULD prefer the use of DNS-ID,
      SRV-ID and URI-ID over CN-ID identifier types in certificate
      requests (as described in Section 2.3 from [RFC6125]) and the
      wildcard character '*' SHOULD NOT be included in presented
      identifier.

   o  For TURN servers that don't have a certificate trust chain (e.g.,
      because they are on a home network or a corporate network), a
      configured list of TURN servers can contain the Subject Public Key
      Info (SPKI) fingerprint of the TURN servers.  The public key is
      used for the same reasons HTTP pinning [RFC7469] uses the public
      key.

   o  Raw public key-based authentication, as defined in [RFC7250],
      could also be used to authenticate a TURN server.

   An auto-discovered TURN server is considered to be only as trusted as
   the path between the client and the TURN server.  In order to safely
   use auto-discovered TURN servers for sessions with 'strict privacy'
   requirements, the user needs to be able to define privacy criteria
   (e.g.  a trusted list of servers, networks, or domains) that are
   considered acceptable for such traffic.  Any discovered TURN server
   outside the criteria is considered untrusted and therefore MUST NOT
   be used for privacy sensitive communication.

   In some auto-discovery scenarios, it might not be possible for the
   TURN client to use (D)TLS authentication to validate the TURN server.
   However, fall-back to clear text in such cases could leave the TURN
   client open to on-path injection of spoofed TURN messages.  A TURN
   client could fall back to encryption-only (D)TLS when (D)TLS
   authentication is not available, but MUST NOT fall back without
   explicit administrator choice.  Another reason to fall-back to
   encryption-only is for privacy, which is analogous to SMTP

   opportunistic encryption [RFC7435] where one does not require privacy
   but one desires privacy when possible.

   In order to allow the TURN client to fallback to (D)TLS as described
   above, a TURN server that does not require either STUN long term
   authentication [RFC5389] or STUN Extension for Third Party
   Authorization [RFC7635] MUST support (D)TLS and if the network
   infrastructure is capable of defending against attacks discussed in
   [RFC5766] then the TURN server MAY allow fallback to clear text.

   A TURN client could fall back to clear text if it does not support
   unauthenticated (D)TLS, but MUST NOT fall back without explicit
   administrator choice.  Fallback to clear text is NOT RECOMMENDED
   because it makes the client more susceptible to man-in-the-middle
   attacks and on-path packet injection.

9.1.  Service Resolution

   The primary attack against the methods described in this document is
   one that would lead to impersonation of a TURN server.  An attacker
   could attempt to compromise the S-NAPTR resolution.  Security
   considerations described in [RFC5928] are applicable here as well.

   In addition to considerations related to S-NAPTR, it is important to
   recognize that the output of this is entirely dependent on its input.
   An attacker who can control the domain name can also control the
   final result.  Because more than one method can be used to determine
   the domain name, a host implementation needs to consider attacks
   against each of the methods that are used.

   If DHCP is used, the integrity of DHCP options is limited by the
   security of the channel over which they are provided.  Physical
   security and separation of DHCP messages from other packets are
   commonplace methods that can reduce the possibility of attack within
   an access network; alternatively, DHCP authentication [RFC3188] can
   provide a degree of protection against modification.  When using DHCP
   discovery, clients are encouraged to use unicast DHCP INFORM queries
   instead of broadcast queries which are more easily spoofed in
   insecure networks.

9.2.  DNS Service Discovery

   Since DNS-SD is just a specification for how to name and use records
   in the existing DNS system, it has no specific additional security
   requirements over and above those that already apply to DNS queries
   and DNS updates.  For DNS queries, DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC)
   [RFC4033] should be used where the authenticity of information is
   important.  For DNS updates, secure updates [RFC2136][RFC3007] should



Patil, et al.             Expires July 16, 2017                [Page 11]

Internet-Draft            TURN server auto disc             January 2017


   generally be used to control which clients have permission to update
   DNS records.

   For mDNS, in addition to what has been described above, a principal
   security threat is a security threat inherent to IP multicast routing
   and any application that runs on it.  A rogue system can advertise
   that it is a TURN server.  Discovery of such rogue systems as TURN
   servers, in itself, is not a security threat if there is a means for
   the TURN client to authenticate and authorize the discovered TURN
   servers.

9.3.  Anycast

   In a network without any TURN server that is aware of the TURN
   anycast address, outgoing TURN requests could leak out onto the
   external Internet, possibly revealing information.

   Using an IANA-assigned well-known TURN anycast address enables border
   gateways to block such outgoing packets.  In the default-free zone,
   routers should be configured to drop such packets.  Such
   configuration can occur naturally via BGP messages advertising that
   no route exists to said address.

   Sensitive clients that do not wish to leak information about their
   presence can set an IP TTL on their TURN requests that limits how far
   they can travel into the public Internet.
