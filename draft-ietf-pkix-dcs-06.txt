Abstract

   This document describes a general Data Validation and Certification
   Server (DVCS) and the protocols to be used when communicating with
   it.  The Data Validation and Certification Server is a Trusted Third
   Party (TTP) that can be used as one component in building reliable
   non-repudiation services (see [ISONR]).

   Useful Data Validation and Certification Server responsibilities in a
   PKI are to assert the validity of signed documents, public key
   certificates, and the possession or existence of data.

   Assertions created by this protocol are called Data Validation
   Certificates (DVC).

   We give examples of how to use the Data Validation and Certification
   Server to extend the lifetime of a signature beyond key expiry or
   revocation and to query the Data Validation and Certification Server
   regarding the status of a public key certificate. the docuyment

1. Introduction

   A Data Validation and Certification Server (DVCS) is a Trusted Third
   Party (TTP) providing data validation services, asserting correctness
   of digitally signed documents, validity of public key certificates,
   and possession or existence of data.

   As a result of the validation, a DVCS generates a Data Validation
   Certificate (DVC) The data validation certificate can be used for
   constructing evidence of non-repudiation, relating to the validity
   and correctness of an entity's claim to possess data, the validity
   and revocation status of an entity's public key certificate and the
   validity and correctness of a digitally signed document.

   Services provided by a DVCS do not replace the usage of CRLs and OCSP
   for public key certificate revocation checking in large open
   environments, due to concerns about the scalability of the protocol.

   It should be rather used to support non-repudiation or to supplement
   more traditional services concerning paperless document environments.
   The presence of a data validation certificate supports non-
   repudiation in two ways. It provides evidence that a digitally signed
   document or public key certificate was valid at the time indicated in
   the dvc.

   A DVC validating a public key certificate can for example be used
   even after the public key certificate expires and its revocation
   information is no longer or not easily available.  Determining the
   validity of a DVC is assumed to be a simpler task, for example, if
   the population of DVCS is significantly smaller than the population
   of public certificate owners.

   An important feature of the protocol is that DVCs can be validated by
   using the same protocol (not necessarily using the same service), and
   the validity of a signed document, in particular a DVC, can also be
   determined by means other than by verifying its signature(s), e.g. by
   comparing against an archive.

   The production of a data validation certificate in response to a
   signed request for validation of a signed document or public key
   certificate also provides evidence that due diligence was performed
   by the requester in validating a digital signature or public key



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                         [Page 2]

   certificate.

   This document defines the use of digital signatures to insure the
   authenticity of documents and DVCs, and uses a corresponding
   terminology; the use of other methods to provide evidence for
   authenticity is not excluded, in particular it is possibile to
   replace a SignedData security envelope by another.


2. Services provided by DVCS

   The current specification defines 4 types of validation and
   certification services:

   - Certification of Possession of Data (cpd),
   - Certification of Claim of Possession of Data (ccpd),
   - Validation of Digitally Signed Document (vsd), and
   - Validation of Public Key Certificates (vpkc).

   A DVCS MUST support at least a subset of these services.  A DVCS may
   support a restructed vsd service allowing to validate data validation
   certificates.

   On completion of each service, the DVCS produces a data validation
   certificate - a signed document containing the validation results and
   trustworthy time information.

2.1 Certification Possession of Data

   The Certification of Possession of Data service provides evidence
   that the requester possessed data at the time indicated and that the
   actual data where presented to the Data Validation Server.

2.2 Certification of Claim of Possession of Data

   The Certification Claim of Possession of Data service is similar to
   the previous one, except that the requester does not present the data
   itself but a message digest. This service is similar to time stamping
   services as described in [TSP].

2.3 Validation of Digitally Signed Documents

   The Validation of Digitally Signed Document service is used when
   validity of a signed document is to be asserted.

   The DVCS verifies all signatures attached to the signed document
   using all appropriate status information and public key certificates.
   The DVCS verifies the mathematical correctness of all signatures



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                         [Page 3]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   attached to the document and also checks whether the signing entities
   can be trusted, for example by validating the full certification path
   from the signing entities to a trusted point (e.g., the DVCS's CA, or
   the root CA in a hierarchy).

   The DVCS may be able to rely on relevant CRLs or may need to
   supplement this with access to more current status information from
   the CAs for example by accessing to an OCSP service, a trusted
   directory service, or other DVCS services.

   The DVCS will perform verification of all signatures attached to the
   signed document. A failure of the verification of one of the
   signatures does not necessarily result in the failure of the entire
   validation, and vice versa, a global failure may occur if the
   document has an insufficient number of signatures.

2.4 Validation of Public Key Certificates

   The Validation of Public Key Certificates service is used to verify
   and assert the validity (according to [RFC2459]) of one or more
   public key certificates at the specified time.

   When verifying a public key certificate, the DVCS verifies that the
   certificate included in the request is a valid certificate and
   determines its revocation status at a specified time.  DVS checks the
   full certification path from the certificate's issuer to a trusted
   point.  Again, the DVCS MAY be able to rely on external information
   (CRL, OCSP, DVCS).

3. Data Certification Server Usage and Scenarii.

   It is outside the scope of this document to completely describe
   different operational scenarii or usages for DVCS.

   See Appendix B and C for a set of some basic examples and use cases.

   The Validate Signed Document service can be used to support non-
   repudiation services, to allow use of the signed document beyond
   public key certificate revocation or expiry, or simply to delegate
   signature validation to a trusted central (company wide) service.

   The Validate Public Key Certificate service can be used when timely
   information regarding a certificate's revocation status is required
   (e.g. high value funds transfer or the compromise of a highly
   sensitive key) or when evidence supporting non-repudiation is
   required.

   A data validation certificate may be used to simplify the validation



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                         [Page 4]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   of a signature beyond the expiry or subsequent revocation of the
   signing certificate: a Data validation certificate used as an
   authenticated attribute in a signature includes an additional
   assertion about the usability of a certificate that was used for
   signing. In order to validate such a signature it may be sufficient
   to only validate the data validation certificate.

   A DVCS may include additional key exchange certificates in a data
   validation certificate to validate a key exchange certificate in
   order to provide to an application a set of additional authorised
   recipients for which a session key should also be encrypted. This can
   be used for example to provide central management of a company wide
   recovery scheme. Note, that the additional certificates may not only
   depend on the requested certificate, but also on the requester's
   identity.

   The Certification of Claim of Possession of Data service is an
   extension and modification of the services described in [TSP].

   The Certification of Possession of Data service can be used to assert
   legal deposit of documents, or to implement archival services as a
   trusted third party service.

   The Data Validation and Certification Server Protocols can be used in
   different service contexts. Examples include company-wide centralised
   services (verification of signatures, certification of company
   certificates), service to cooperate in a multi-organisation
   community, or general third party services for time stamping or data
   archival.

   An important application of DVCS is an enterprise environment where
   all security decision are based on company wide rules.  A company
   wide DVCS service can be used to delegate all technical decisions
   (e.g., path validation, trust configuration) to a centrally managed
   service.

   In all cases, the trust that PKI entities have in the Data Validation
   and Certification Server is transferred to the contents of the Data
   Validation Certificate  (just as trust in a CA is transferred to the
   public key certificates that it issues).

   A DVCS service may be combined with or use archiving and logging
   systems, in order to serve as a strong building block in non-
   repudiation services. In this sense it can be regarded as an Evidence
   Recording Authority [ISO-NR].

4. Functional Requirements for DVCS

   The DVCS MUST

   1. provide a signed response in the form of a data validation
      certificate to the requester, as defined by policy, or an error
      response. The DVCS service definition and the policy define how
      much information that has been used by the DVCS to generate the
      response will be included in a data validation certificate, e.g.,
      public key certificates, CRLs, and responses from other OCSP
      servers, TSA and DVCS.

   2. indicate in the data validation certificate whether or not the
      signed document, the public key certificate(s), or the data were
      validated, and, if not, the reason why the verification failed.

   3. include a strictly monotonously increasing serial number in each
      data validation certificate.

   4. include a time of day value or a time stamp token into each data
      validation certificate.

   5. sign each data certification token using a key that has been
      certified with a dvcs signing extended key purpose, and include a
      reference to this certificate as a signed attributes in the
      signature.

   6. check the validity of its own signing key and certificate before
      delivering data validation certificates and MUST not deliver data
      validation certificate in case of failure.

   A DVCS SHOULD include within each data validation certificate a
   policy identifier to determine the trust and validation policy used
   for DVC's signature.


5. Data Certification Server Transactions

   A DVCS transaction begins with a client preparing a Data Validation
   and Certification Request.  The request always contains data for
   which validity, correctness or possession is to be certified.

   The request MAY be encapsulated using a security envelope to provide
   for authentication of both requester and server. requester
   authentication can be achieved by several of the formats described in
   CMS, in particular, signedData.

   The DVCS client chooses an appropriate transport mechanism to convey



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                         [Page 6]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   the requests to a DVCS. It may also be necessary to choose a
   transport mechanism providing confidentiality and, in particular,
   allowing authentication of the DVCS by the requestor, e.g. TLS or CMS
   or S/MIME encryption.

   If the request is valid, the DVCS performs all necessary
   verifications steps, and generates a Data Validation Certificate
   (DVC), and sends a response message containing the DVC back to the
   requestor.

   The Data Validation Certificate is formed as a signed document (CMS
   SignedData).

   As with the request, it may be necessary to choose a transport
   mechanism that provides for confidentiality to carry the DVC. DVCs
   are do not necessarily transported the same way as requests, e.g.
   they can be returned using e-mail after an online request received
   via HTTPS.

   If the request was invalid, the DVCS generates a response message
   containing an appropriate error notification.

   Upon receiving the response, the requesting entity SHOULD verify its
   validity, i.e. whether it contains an acceptable time, the correct
   name for the DVCS, the correct request information and message
   imprint, a valid signature, and satisfactory status, service and
   policy fields.

   When verifying the validity of a DVC, it is up to the requestor's
   application to check whether a DVCS's signing certificate was valid.
   Depending on the usage environment, different methods, online or out
   of band, e.g., CRLs, DVCS, or OCSP, may have to be used.

   After all checks passed, the data validation certificate can be used
   to authenticate the correctness or possession of the corresponding
   data.

   A DVCS may return more than one DVC corresponding to one request. In
   this case, all but one request have a global status of 'WAITING'.

6. Identification of the DVCS

   In order to be able to import elements from dvcs the following object
   identifier is used as a ASN.1 module identifier.

   id-mod-dvcs  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {iso(1) identified-organization(3)
         dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) id-mod(0) 15}




Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                         [Page 7]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   The DVCS that use SignedData to provide authentication for DVCs MUST
   sign all data certification messages with a key whose corresponding
   certificate MUST contain the extended key usage field extension as
   defined in [RFC2459] Section 4.2.1.14 with KeyPurposeID having value
   id-kp-dvcs.  This extension MUST be marked as critical.

   The Data Validation Certificate MUST contain an ESSCertID
   authenticated attribute for the certificate used by the DVCS for
   signing.

   id-kp-dvcs   OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) identified-
   organization(3)
         dod(6) internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) kp(3) 10 }

   Consistent KeyUsage bits:

   digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign

   A DVCS's certificate MAY contain an Authority Information Access
   extension [RFC2459] in order to convey the method of contacting the
   DVCS.  The accessMethod field in this extension MUST contain the OID
   id-ad-dvcs:

   id-ad-dvcs  OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {iso(1)
                  identified-organization(3) dod(6)
                  internet(1) security(5) mechanisms(5) pkix(7) ad(48)
   4}

   The value of the field 'accessLocation' field defines the transport
   (e.g., an URI) used to access the DVCS.

7. Common Data Types

   There are several common data types that occur in the request and the
   response data structures. These data types are either defined by this
   document or imported from other sources. This chapter defines and
   describes these types and lists their usages.

7.1 Version:

   The request and the response include an optional integer field
   specifying the version of the data structure. For both fields the
   value is 1, or the field is not present at all in this version of the
   protocol.

7.2 DigestInfo:

   This element is defined in [RFC2315]. Since the status of that



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                         [Page 8]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   document is informational, the definition is repeated here:

   DigestInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
       digestAlgorithm   DigestAlgorithmIdentifier,
       digest            Digest
   }

   Digest ::= OCTET STRING

   The fields of type DigestInfo have the following meanings:

   - The field 'digestAlgorithm' identifies the message-digest algorithm
     (and any associated parameters) under which data are digested.

   - The field 'digest' is the result of the message-digesting process.

   A DigestInfo is used in two places:

   - as a data portion for the ccpd service, and

   - in all a data validation certificates to hold a digest of the data
     portion of the corresponding request or a copy of the data field
     for a ccpd service.

7.3. Time Values

   Indicators of time can be present in requests and responses.  In the
   most simple form, the time is represented as GeneralizedTime where
   fractions of seconds are allowed.

   An alternate form is a timeStampToken from a TSA, or as a DVC (or
   some other token) from another third party service.

   It is a matter of policy whether a DVCS tries to interprete or
   validate a Time Value in a request.

   DVCSTime ::= CHOICE  {
        genTime                      GeneralizedTime,
        timeStampToken               ContentInfo
   }

   Future versions of the protocol MAY include additional time formats.

   Time values generated by the DVCS are increasing but not necessarily
   unique, an order among DVCs is defined by serial numbers.

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


7.4. PKIStatusInfo

   This structure is defined in [RFC2510]. It is used as component of
   the 'chain' field of a TargetEtcChain structure, and as a global
   status indicator in the DVCSResponse structure. Every occurrence of
   PKIStatusInfo is generated by the responding DVCS to reflect the
   result of some local verification.

7.5. TargetEtcChain

   A TargetEtcChain structure contains certificates and other indicators
   to describe either (in a request for a cpkc service) information to
   be validated, or the result of the verifications. The structure may
   also contain information about policies and policy mappings.

   The details about how to fill in and to interpret the structure are
   defined later for each service.

   The 'pathProcInput' field contains information about policies and
   policy mapping to be used or used during a validation.

   In a response, the 'pkistatus' and 'certstatus' choices can only
   occur in in the 'chain' sequence.  If present, they contain the
   result of a local verification of the immediately preceding element,
   or of the target value, if it is the first element in the 'chain'
   sequence. If no 'pkistatus' or 'certstatus' is present, the DVCS
   considers all elements in the 'chain' as trustworthy. Note, that
   there may be valid OCSP response or DVC indicating an invalid
   certificate.

   TargetEtcChain ::= SEQUENCE {
        target                       CertEtcToken,
        chain                        SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                        CertEtcToken OPTIONAL,
        pathProcInput                [0] PathProcInput OPTIONAL
   }

   PathProcInput ::= SEQUENCE {
        acceptablePolicySet          SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                        PolicyInformation,
        inhibitPolicyMapping         BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
        explicitPolicyReqd           BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
   }

   CertEtcToken ::= CHOICE {
        certificate                  [0] IMPLICIT Certificate ,
        esscertid                    [1] ESSCertId ,
        pkistatus                    [2] IMPLICIT PKIStatusInfo ,



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 10]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


        assertion                    [3] ContentInfo ,
        crl                          [4] IMPLICIT CertificateList,
        ocspcertstatus               [5] IMPLICIT CertStatus,
        oscpcertid                   [6] IMPLICIT CertId ,
        oscpresponse                 [7] IMPLICIT OCSPResponse,
        capabilities                 [8] SMIMECapabilities,
        extension                    Extension
   }

   Certificate, PolicyInformation and CertificateList are defined in
   [RFC2459]. ESSCertId is defined in [RFC2634]. CertId, OCSPResponse
   and CertStatus are defined in [RFC2560]. PKIStatusField is defined in
   [RFC2510].

   The choice 'assertion' can contain a data validation certificate, or
   a timeStamp, or other assertions.

   The choices 'assertion', 'ocspresponse' and 'crl' are provided by
   services external to the responding DVCS. The choices 'certStatus'
   and 'pkistatus' reflect decisions made directly by the responding
   DVCS.

   As a replacement for certificates, certification identifiers
   (ESSCertId, CertId)  MAY be used in requests and responses, if this
   is sufficient to perform the service, e.g., when the corresponding
   certificates are provided elsewhere in a request or response (as part
   of the SignedData type).

   Certificate or certification identifiers of certification authorities
   MAY occur in any order and MAY represent several certification
   chains.

   The choice 'capablities' can be used to indicate SMIMECapabilities.
   It applies to the certificate identified by the preceding element in
   the sequence.


7.6. DVCSRequestInformation

   A DVCSRequestInformation data structure contains general information
   about the Data Validation and Certification Request. This structure
   occurs in a request, and is also included in a corresponding Data
   Validation Certificate.

   DVCSRequestInformation ::= SEQUENCE  {
           version                      INTEGER DEFAULT 1 ,
           service                      ServiceType,
           nonce                        INTEGER OPTIONAL,



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 11]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


           requestTime                  DVCSTime OPTIONAL,
           requester                    [0] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
           requestPolicy                [1] PolicyInformation OPTIONAL,
           dvcs                         [2] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
           dataLocations                [3] GeneralNames OPTIONAL,
           extensions                   [4] IMPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL
   }

   The ServiceType type enumerates the DVCS service type of a request.
   See chapter 2 for the description of the services.

   ServiceType ::= ENUMERATED { cpd(1), vsd(2), cpkc(3), ccpd(4) }


7.7. GeneralName and GeneralNames

   There are several occurences of SEQUENCES of GeneralName and
   GeneralNames These structures are imported from [RFC2459].

8. Data Validation and Certification Requests

   A Data Validation and Certification request is a ContentInfo defined
   in [RFC2630].

   It may consists of a [RFC2630] content with a contenttype id-ct-
   DVCSRequestData signalling a DVCSRequestData,

   id-ct-DVCSRequestData      OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-
   body(2) us(840)                  rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9)
   smime(16) ct(1) 7 }

   These data are optionally encapsulated by contenttypes that provide
   for authentication and/or confidentiality.

   This document describes the usage of a SignedData construct of
   [RFC2630] where the contenttype indicated in the eContentType of the
   encapContentInfo is id-ct-DVCSRequestData and the eContent of the
   encapContentInfo, carried as an octet string, contains a
   DVCSRequestData structure.

   When using a SignedData structure, a Data Validation and
   Certification Request MAY contain several SignerInfo structures, and
   countersignature attributes depending on operational environments.
   When an end user client creates the request, there is one or zero
   SignerInfo.  A relaying DVCS MAY add an additional signature or a
   countersignature attribute, or MAY use another encapsulation from
   [RFC2630] that provides for authentication and/or confidentiality.

   The content of a request consists of a description of the desired
   service and additional parameters, the data to be validated, and an
   optional identifier of the request.

   DVCSRequest ::= SEQUENCE  {
       requestInformation         DVCSRequestInformation,
       data                       Data,
       transactionIdentifier      GeneralName OPTIONAL
   }

   The 'DVCSRequest.requestInformation' element contains general
   information about the request. It is filled in by the requester as
   follows:

   - The 'version' field is set to 1 or the field is absent in this
     version of the protocol.

     The field 'service' contains the requested service.

   - The 'nonce' field MAY be used to provide additional protection
     against replay or content guessing attacks.

   - The 'requestTime' field MAY be used to indicate the time for which
     the requested service should be performed. For a vsd and cpkc
     service, it specifies the time for which the validity of a signed
     document or certicates is to be asserted. For the other service,
     the field is ignored by the DVCS.  If the field is absent, the
     current time is assumed.

   - The value of the 'requester' field indicates the requesting entity.

     The interpretation and usage of this field MUST be defined by the
     DVCS policy.

     Some usage example are:

     If the field is present, and the request is signed, a DVCS MAY for
     example require that the field MUST match the identity (subjectName
     or subjectAltName extension) of the corresponding signature
     certificate,

     A request MAY be signed by a DVCS when relaying it to another DVCS.

     When acting as a relay, a DVCS MAY add its own identity in the
     request relayed to another service provider, and it MAY remove the
     initial value.

   - The 'requestPolicy' field SHOULD indicate the policy under which



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 13]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


     the validation is requested. This field MUST be checked by the DVCS
     to verify agreement with its own policy. The absence of this field
     indicates that any policy is acceptable.

   - The 'dvcs' field MAY be used to indicate a list a DVCS which can be
     contacted to provide (additional) information or to perform
     additional operations necessary to produce the response.

     It is up to the DVCS policy whether to honor this field or not, and
     to define which choice of a general name is acceptable (e.g. an URL
     or a DN).


   - The 'dataLocations' field MAY be used to indicate where a copy of
     the 'data' field of the request or supplementary information can be
     obtained. The DVCS does not use this field for its own operation,
     the exact interpretation of this field is defined by applications.

   - The 'requestTime' field MAY be used to indicate the time for which
     the requested service should be performed. For a vsd and cpkc
     service, it specifies the time for which the validity of a signed
     document or certicates is to be asserted. For the other service,
     the field is ignored by the DVCS.  If the field is absent, the
     current time is assumed.  The DVCS service may have a time limit or
     a delta time limit regarding current time which are specified in
     the local policy of the DVCS service.


   - The 'extensions' field MAY be used to include additional
     information. Extensions may be marked critical or not in order to
     indicate whether the DVCS is supposed to understand them. This
     document does not define extensions.

   The DVCSRequest.data contains service-specific content, defined by
   each particular service provided by the DVCS.

   Depending on the requested service type, the field may contain a
   signed document, a list of certificates, a message digest or
   arbitrary data.

   The following type is used:

   Data ::= CHOICE {
         message           OCTET STRING ,
         messageImprint    DigestInfo,
         certs             SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                               TargetEtcChain
   }



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 14]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   The requester fills the 'data' element as follows:

   - For a vsd service request, the requestor encapsulates a CMS
     SignedData object in the value octets of the 'message' choice.

     It is up to the requester to decide whether and how to provide any
     certificate that may be needed to verify the signature(s) in the
     signedData object. A requester MAY add certificates to the
     encapsulated signedData object or in the certificate list of the
     request.


   - For a cpkc service request the 'certs' choice is used.

     Each certificate to be verified MUST be included in a separate
     instance of TargetEtcChain, and to be verified.  The
     'TargetEtcChain.chain' field, if present, MUST indicate the chain
     of trust to be used when certifying the certificate.  The
     'TargetEtcChain.pathProcInput' field, if present, indicates the
     acceptable policy set and initial settings for explicit-policy-
     indicator and inhibit-policy-mapping indicators to be used in X.509
     public key certificate path validation (see [RFC2459]).

     Only the Certificate, ESSCertId, CertId or Extension choices of the
     TargetEtcChain can be used in the request.

     The requester is responsible for providing sufficient information
     to the DVCS to identify the corresponding certificates.

   - For a ccpd service the 'messageImprint' choice is used.

     The hash algorithm indicated in the hashAlgorithm field SHOULD be a
     "strong" hash algorithm (that is, it SHOULD be one-way and
     collision resistant). It is up to the Data Certification Server to
     decide whether or not the given hash algorithm is sufficiently
     "strong" (based on the current state of knowledge in cryptanalysis
     and the current state of the art in computational resources, for
     example).

   - For a cpd service the 'message' choice is used.

     The field contains requester-specific data with any type of
     content.  The DVCS does not inspect, modify, or take any particular
     action based on the particular content of the 'message' field.

   The field 'DVCSRequest.transactionIdentifier' MAY be used in order to
   associate DVCS responses containing error messages, to requests.  For
   example, in a mail based environment, the parameter could be a copy



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 15]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   of a messageid.  Note, that the transactionIdentifier is not
   necessary for associating a request with a valid data validation
   certificate.

9. DVCS Responses

   This chapters describes the data structures that are created by a
   DVCS to indicate the results of validation and certification
   requests.

   A DVCS Response structure is generated by the DVCS as a result of
   processing of the data validation and certification request.

   A Data Validation resonse contain an [RFC2630] ContentInfo with a
   type of id-ct-DVCSResponseData signalling a DVCSResponse structure.

   id-ct-DVCSResponseData OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2)
   us(840)                  rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16)
   ct(1) 8 }

   The data MAY be encapsulated by constructs of [RFC2630] in order to
   provide authentication of the DVCS, and or integrity and
   confidentiality of the request. This document specifies the usage of
   a SignedData construct of [RFC2630].

   The contenttype indicated in the eContentType of the encapContentInfo
   is of type id-ct-DVCSResponseData, signalling a DVCSResponse as
   eContent of the encapContentInfo (carried as an octet string).  The
   DVCS SHOULD use a key for which a corresponding certificate indicates
   in an extendedKeyUsage the purpose of DVCS signing.

   In a critical situation when a DVCS cannot produce a valid signature
   (if the DVCS's signing key is known to be compromised, for example),
   the DVCSResponse, containing the error notification, MUST be
   generated as a signedData with no signerInfo attached.  Receiving
   unsigned DVCSResponse MUST be treated by the clients as critical and
   fatal error, and the content of the message should not be implicitly
   trusted.

   A valid response can contain one of the following:

   1. A Data Validation Certificate (DVC), delivering the results of
      data validation operations, performed by the DVCS.

   2. An error notification. This may happen when a request fails due to
      a parsing error, requester authentication failure, or anything
      else that prevented the DVCS from executing the request.




Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 16]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   The following type is used:

   DVCSResponse ::= CHOICE
   {
       dvCertInfo         DVCSCertInfo ,
       dvErrorNote        [0] DVCSErrorNotice
   }


9.1. Data Validation Certificate

   A Data Validation Certificate is a signedData object containing a
   DVCSResponse with a 'dvCertInfo' choice.

   DVCSCertInfo::= SEQUENCE  {
            version             Integer DEFAULT 1 ,
            dvReqInfo           DVCSRequestInformation,
            messageImprint      DigestInfo,
            serialNumber        Integer,
            responseTime        DVCSTime,
            dvStatus            [0] PKIStatusInfo OPTIONAL,
            policy              [1] PolicyInformation OPTIONAL,
            reqSignature        [2] SignerInfos  OPTIONAL,
            certs               [3] SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF
                                    TargetEtcChain OPTIONAL,
            extensions          Extensions OPTIONAL }

   The DVCSCertInfo structure is returned as a result of successful
   execution of data validation service. It contains the results of the
   data validation, a reference to the original request, and other
   parameters. Please note that 'successful execution' does not
   necessarily mean that the validation itself was successful - a
   DVCSCertInfo may contain both the 'valid' and 'invalid' results.

   The DVCS creates a DVCSCertInfo as follows:

   - The 'version' field is never present in this version of the
     protocol.

     The 'dvReqInfo' is essentially a copy of the 'requestInformation'
     field of the corresponding request. The DVCS MAY modify the fields
     'dvcs', 'requester' and 'dataLocations', and 'nonce' of the ReqInfo
     structure, e.g., if the request was processed by a chain of DVCS,
     if the request to indicate DVCS, or to indicate where to find a
     copy of the data from a 'vpd' request. The only modification
     allowed to a 'nonce' is the inclusion of a new field if it was not
     present, or to concatenate other data to the end (right) of an
     existing value.



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 17]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   - The 'DVCSCertInfo.messageImprint' field is computed from the 'data'
     field of the corresponding request as follows:

     For the 'certs' choice (the 'vpkc' service), the digest is computed
     over the DER encoded data value. For a 'message' choice (the 'vsd'
     and the 'vpd' services) the digest is computed over the value
     octets (not including tag and length octets) of the OCTET STRING.
     It is up to the DVCS to choose an appropriate digest algorithm.

     For a 'messageImprint' choice (the 'vcpd' service), the
     'messageImprint'
      of the DVCSRequest is copied as is.

   - The 'DVCSCertInfo.serialNumber' field contains a unique identifier
     of the request.

   - The field 'responseTime' indicates a time value associated to the
     response.  The value MAY be a locally generated one, or a signed
     TimeStampToken (TST) or DVC obtained from an external service.
     Before using a value obtained from an external service, the DVCS
     must validate it according the rules of the external service.

   - The 'DVCSCertInfo.nonce' field MAY be used to protect against
     replay attacks.

   - The field 'DVCSCertInfo.dvStatus' reflects a collective result of
     the validation.

     If the field is missing, it is an equvivalent of the SUCCESS
     status.

     For a vkpc, if the status field is present and set to SUCCESS, it
     indicates that all certificates were successfully validated. If it
     is present and set to FAILED, it indicates that all or some of the
     certificates failed validation, and the specific status of the
     'certs' should be investigated, at least of the elements of the
     'certs' TargetEtcChain structures MUST have a failure status.

     If the field 'dvStatus' does not indicate success ('granted' or
     'granted with mods') the element 'failInfo' MAY indicate the reason
     for the failure.  Note that the field 'certs' MAY contain
     additional information about verification failures.

     A failure of the verification of one of the signatures does not
     necessarily result in failing to validate a signed document. For
     example, as long as a sufficient number of signature was
     successfully verified, a DVC with status `grantedWithMods` may be
     produced.  A DVC with status `granted` MUST only be produced if all



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 18]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


     signatures verified successfully.

     The field MUST be present, and the status must be set to WAITING,
     if no final response can be immediately available. It is assumed
     that the DVCS provides an additional final status some time later.
     The details of the necessary procedures are part of the DVCS
     policy.

     In case of failure, the requester can further investigate the cause
     of the failure, by looking into the TargetEtcChain fields.
     'CertEtctoken.pkistatus' fields will indicate which item(s) has
     failed or succeeded the validation and for what reason.


   - The 'DVCSCertInfo.policy' field indicates the policy under which
     the DVCS operates.

   - If present, 'DVCSCertInfo.reqSignature' MUST be the same value as
     the signerInfos field of the corresponding request. It is a policy
     decision whether to include this field.

   - The 'DVCSCertInfo.certs' field contains the results of the
     verifications made by the DVCS. For the cpkc service, each element
     contains a copy of a corresponding field of the request and the
     results of the verifications, and additional certificates or
     certificate references, e.g., from certification authorities or as
     described in appendix C.3.  For a vsd service, each element
     contains the result of the validation of one signature of the
     signed document to be validated.

     In case of a global status of WAITING, the DVCS MAY choose to
     return an invidual status of waiting in some of the 'certs' field,
     or not to return such a TargetEtcChain at all.

     The 'acceptablePolicySet' sequence  indicate the policies and
     mappings that were processed during X.509 public key certificate
     path validation.  PolicyMappingsSyntax is defined in [RFC2459].


   - The 'extensions' field MAY be used to return additional information
     to the client. Extensions MAY be marked critical or not in order to
     indicate whether the client is supposed to understand them. This
     document does not define extensions.

9.2. DVCS Error Notification

   A DVCS Error Notification is a CMS signedData object containing a
   DVCSResponse with a 'dvErrorNote' choice.



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 19]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   DVCSErrorNotice ::= SEQUENCE {
       transactionStatus           PKIStatusInfo ,
       transactionIdentifier       GeneralName OPTIONAL }

   The PKIStatusInfo is defined in the [RFC2511].  For the purposes of
   communicating the DVCSErrorNotice, the following subset of
   PKIFailureInfo values is used:

   PKIFailureInfo ::= BITSTRING  {

        badRequest       (2),
        -- transaction not permitted or supported
        badTime          (3),
        -- messageTime was not sufficiently close to the system time,
        -- as defined by local policy
        badDataFormat    (5),
        -- the data submitted has the wrong format
        wrongAuthority   (6),
        -- the DVCS indicated in the request is different from the
        -- one creating the response token
        incorrectData    (7)
        --the requester's data (i.e.  signature) is incorrect
   )

   In the DVCSErrorNotice, the PKIStatus field of the PKIStatusInfo must
   be set to REJECTED.

   The 'statusString' field of PKIStatusInfo can be used to accommodate
   extra text, such as a reason for the failure, for example "I have
   gone out of service".  The DVCS initialises the
   'DVCSErrorNotice.transactionIdentifier' with a copy of the
   'DVCSRequest.transactionIdentifier' field of the corresponding
   request.

   In certain circumstances, a DVCS may not be able to produce a valid
   response to a request (for example, if it is unable to compute
   signatures for a period of time).  In these situations the DVCS MAY
   create a response with an DVCSErrorNotice but no signature.

   DVCS clients SHOULD NOT trust unsigned responses. A DVCS client MAY
   trust unsigned responses, if the communication channel provides for
   server authentication (e.g. by services defined by TLS [RFC2246]).

10. Transports

   There is no mandatory transport mechanism in this document.  All
   mechanisms are optional. Two examples of transport protocols are
   given which allow online exchange of request and a response, and



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 20]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   asymchronous communication between a client and a DVCS.

   A DVCS MAY use a combination of protocol, for exmaple in order to
   return additional DVCs.

10.1 DVCS Protocol via HTTP or HTTPS

   This subsection specifies a means for conveying ASN.1-encoded
   messages for the DVCS protocol exchanges via the HyperText Transfer
   Protocol.

   The DER encoded DVCS requests and responses are encapsulated using a
   simple MIME object with Content-Type application/dvcs and an
   appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding.

   This MIME object can be sent and received using common HTTP or HTTPS
   processing engines over WWW links and provides a simple client-server
   transport for DVCS messages.

10.2 DVCS Protocol Using Email

   This section specifies a means for conveying ASN.1-encoded messages
   for the protocol exchanges described in Section 4 via Internet mail.

   The DER encoded DVCS requests and responses are encapsulated using a
   simple MIME object with Content-Type application/dvcs with an
   appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding.

   This MIME object can be sent and received using MIME processing
   engines and provides a simple Internet mail transport for DVCS
   messages.

   In order to be able to associate a possible error response to a
   request, the requester SHOULD use the field 'transactionIdentifier'.
   The requester SHOULD not make any assumption about the usage of
   message header fields by the responding service, in particular the
   usage of fields like Subject, Message-ID, References.

11. Security Considerations

   This entire chapter discusses security considerations.

   When designing a data validation and certification service, the
   following considerations have been identified that have an impact
   upon the validity or "trust" in the data validation certificate.

   It is imperative that keys used to sign DVCs are guarded with proper
   security and controls in order to minimize the possibility of



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 21]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   compromise. Nevertheless, in case the private key does become
   compromised, an audit trail of all the DVC generated by the DVCS
   SHOULD be kept as a means to help discriminate between genuine and
   false DVCs. A DVCS MAY provide for an vsd service to validate DVCs
   created by this DVCS or another one solely based on the audit trail.

   When confidentiality and server authentication is required, requests
   and responses MAY be protected using appropriate mechanisms (e.g. CMS
   encapsulation [RFC 2630] or TLS [RFC2246]).

   Server authentication is highly recommended for the vsd and cpd
   service.

   Client identification and authentication MAY use services defined by
   TLS [RFC2246]) instead of, or in addition to, using a CMS format
   providing authentication.

12. Patent Information

   The following United States Patents related to data validation and
   certification services, listed in chronological order, are known by
   the authors to exist at this time. This may not be an exhaustive
   list. Other patents may exist or be issued at any time. Implementers
   of the DVCS protocol and applications using the protocol SHOULD
   perform their own patent search and determine whether or not any
   encumberences exist on their implementation.

APPENDIX A - PKCS #9 Attribute




Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 24]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


   We define a PKCS #9 [PKCS9] attribute type. The attribute type has
   ASN.1 type SignedData and contains a data validation certificate.

   The object identifier id-aa-dvcs-dvc identifies the data valication
   certificate attribute type.

   id-aa-dvcs-dvc OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { iso(1) member-body(2) us(840)
                    rsadsi(113549) pkcs(1) pkcs-9(9) smime(16) aa(2) 29 }

   The attribute may be used as a authenticated or unauthenticated
   attribute in CMS SignedData documents.

APPENDIX B - Signed document validation.

   We present some examples of a possible use of DVCS in the context of
   validation of signed documents.

B.1 Signed document validation

   The example covers the case where a DVCS is used by a signer to
   obtain a proof that a document's structure, including one or more
   attached signatures, is/was correct, after the document was signed.

   The DVC can be produced either by a DVCS that is trusted by the
   signer, or by a DVCS that is trusted by an intended verifier of the
   document.

   The signer uses the obtained DVC as an evidence that its intentions
   were good and it produced a signed document using the
   environment(keys, algorithms, etc) that was known to be OK.

   It produces a stand-alone document that can be used to extend the
   life of a signature.  This example assumes that we have total trust
   in the Data Validation and Certification Server.

   Signature algorithms and keys have a finite lifetime.  Therefore,
   signatures have a finite lifetime.  The Data Certification Server can
   be used to extend the lifetime of a signature.

   In order to extend the lifetime of a signature in this way, the
   following technique can be used:


   1) The signature needs to be certified:

      The signed message is presented to the Data Validation and
      Certification Server in a 'vsd' service request.




Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 25]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


      The DVCS verifies that the signature and certificates are valid at
      that time by checking expiry dates, status information, or DVCs,
      and returns a DVC.

   2) The DVC SHOULD be verified.

      The signature of the Data Validation and Certification Server in
      data certification token SHALL be verified using the Data
      Certification Server's valid verification key.

   A signer's signing key (and therefore, its signature) is only valid
   until some specified time T1.  The DVCS's signing key (and therefore,
   its signature) is valid until some specified time T2 that is
   (usually) after time T1.  Without certification, the signer's
   signature would only be valid until time T1.  With certification, the
   signer's signature remains valid until time T2, regardless of
   subsequent revocation or expiry at time T1.

   If the signature of the DVCS is valid, the trust we have in the DVCS
   allows us to conclude that the original signature on the data was
   valid at the time included in the DVC.

   The DVCS signing key MUST be of a sufficient length to allow for a
   sufficiently long lifetime.  Even if this is done, the key will have
   a finite lifetime.  Since data validation certificates are just
   another type of signed documents, they can be validated using
   (another) DVCS.

APPENDIX C - Verifying the Status of a Public Key Certificate

   We now present three examples of how to produce a data validation
   certificate that can be used to assert that a public key certificate
   is valid, trusted, and can be used for a particular purpose.

   A client wants to use a given public key certificate either to use it
   to sign a document or to use it for document encryption.

   A DVCS MUST have access to current information regarding public
   certificate status, it can therefore be used to verify the revocation
   status of a certificate at the current time.

   The following technique can be used:


   A) The public key certificate needs to be validated.

      The certificate is presented to the Data Certification Server
      using a 'vpkc' service.



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 26]

draft-ietf-pkix-dcs-06.txt   DVCS Protocols           September 14, 2000


      The Data Validation and Certification Server verifies that the
      public key certificate is valid and that it hasn't been revoked
      and then returns a data validation certificate.

   B) The data validation certificate MUST be verified.

      The signature of the Data Certification Server in the data
      certification token SHALL be verified using the Data Validation
      and Certification Server's valid certificate.

   C) The public key certificate is used:

   C.1) A clients's own public key certificate (i.e., the corresponding
        private key) can be used to add a signature to a document. The
        signing certificate and the data validation certificate can be
        added as signed attributes to the signature.

        A data validation certificate can now be used during the
        validation signatures using the key contained in the public key
        certificate. This service provided by the DVCS can be thought of
        as a supplement to the usual method of checking revocation
        status.

        In other words, signature validation at a later time does not
        necessarily require access to the revocation status of the
        user's signing certificate, access to a DVCS service and
        validation of the DVC is sufficient to verify a signature. Note
        that the DVC does not tell when the signature had been created,
        it only indicates when the signing certificate was valid.

   C.2) A public key certificate for key exchange can be used after
        having obtained a data validation certification certificate to
        encrypt data. The DVC can be stored with the data and/or stored
        by the creator of the encrypted document.

        If an intended recipient of the document claims that the creator
        did not use an appropriate encryption key, the DVC (obtained by
        a recipient's DVCS) can be used as evidence that the recipient's
        DVCS has authorized the usage of the public key.

   C.3) The procedure described in the previous paragraph can be
        enhanced to provide domain encryption in several ways.
        Organisations require that encrypted documents need to be
        recoverable. One simple way is to always encryt documents with
        additional recipients that acts as 'domain encryption centers'
        or 'recovery centers'. This is technically not a difficult
        problem, but may require complicated and difficult interactions
        with the end user, in particular when the document's recipients



Adams, Sylvester, Zolotarev, Zuccherato                        [Page 27]

        are in several different organisations.

        One possible solution consists of adding additional certificates
        to the dvc that validates the usage of a particular public key
        certificate used for encryption. In an environment of several
        organisation, one of the possible procedures may be:

        The client asks its local dvcs to validate the public key
        certificate.  The dvcs forwards the request to a dvcs of a
        remote organisation.  The remotes organisation's dvcs verifies
        the certificate and provides a dvc assertion validating the
        certificate. It adds additional certificates usable for key
        exchange to the certEtcChain structure indication additional
        required recipients.  The local dvc creates a dvc containing the
        dvc of the remote dvcs. It may add additional certificates or
        references to the dvc.  The clients uses all validated
        certificates to be usable for key exchange to enhance its list
        of recipients.

        In the local dvcs may as well use local information about the
        remote organisation's need for additional recipients.
