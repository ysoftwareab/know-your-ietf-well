Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Softwires Working Group has selected Layer Two Tunneling Protocol
   version 2 (L2TPv2) as the phase 1 protocol to be deployed in the
   Softwire "Hub and Spoke" solution space.  This document describes the
   framework for the L2TPv2 "Hub and Spoke" solution, and the
   implementation details specified in this document should be followed
   to achieve interoperability among different vendor implementations.

   In the "Hub and Spoke" solution space, a Softwire is established to
   provide the home network with IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only
   access network, or IPv6 connectivity across an IPv4-only access
   network.  When L2TPv2 is used in the Softwire context, the voluntary
   tunneling model applies.  The Softwire Initiator (SI) at the home
   network takes the role of the L2TP Access Concentrator (LAC) client
   (initiating both the L2TP tunnel/session and the PPP link) while the
   Softwire Concentrator (SC) at the ISP takes the role of the L2TP
   Network Server (LNS).  The terms voluntary tunneling and compulsory
   tunneling are defined in Section 1.1 of [RFC3193].  Since L2TPv2
   compulsory tunneling model does not apply to Softwires, it SHOULD NOT
   be requested or honored.  This document identifies all the voluntary
   tunneling related L2TPv2 attributes that apply to Softwires and
   specifies the handling mechanism for such attributes in order to
   avoid ambiguities in implementations.  This document also identifies
   the set of L2TPv2 attributes specific to compulsory tunneling model
   that do not apply to Softwires and specifies the mechanism to ignore
   or nullify their effect within the Softwire context.

   The SI and SC MUST follow the L2TPv2 operations described in
   [RFC2661] when performing Softwire establishment, tear-down and OAM.
   With L2TPv2, a Softwire consists of an L2TPv2 Control Connection
   (also referred to as Control Channel), a single L2TPv2 Session, and
   the PPP link negotiated over the Session.  To establish the Softwire,
   the SI first initiates an L2TPv2 Control Channel to the SC which
   accepts the request and terminates the Control Channel.  L2TPv2
   supports an optional mutual Control Channel authentication which
   allows both SI and SC to validate each other's identity at the
   initial phase of hand-shaking before proceeding with Control Channel
   establishment.  After the L2TPv2 Control Channel is established
   between the SI and SC, the SI initiates an L2TPv2 Session to the SC.
   Then the PPP/IP link is negotiated over the L2TPv2 Session between
   the SI and SC.  After the PPP/IP link is established, it acts as the
   Softwire between the SI and SC for tunneling IP traffic of one
   Address Family (AF) across the access network of another Address
   Family.

   During the life of the Softwire, both SI and SC send L2TPv2 keepalive
   HELLO messages to monitor the health of the Softwire and the peer

   LCCE, and to potentially refresh the NAT/NAPT translation entry at
   the CPE or at the other end of the access link.  Optionally, LCP ECHO
   messages can be used as keepalives for the same purposes.  In the
   event of keepalive timeout or administrative shutdown of the
   Softwire, either SI or SC MAY tear down the Softwire by tearing down
   the L2TPv2 Control Channel and Session as specified in [RFC2661].

1.4.  Considerations

   Some sections of this document contain considerations that are not
   required for interoperability and correct operation of Softwire
   implementations.  These sections are marked as "Considerations".


2.  Applicability of L2TPv2 for Softwire Requirements

   A list of Softwire "Hub and Spoke" requirements has been identified
   by the Softwire Problem Statement [RFC4925].  The following sub-
   sections describe how L2TPv2 fulfills each of them.

2.1.  Traditional Network Address Translation (NAT and NAPT)

   A "Hub and Spoke" Softwire must be able to traverse Network Address
   Translation (NAT) and Network Address Port Translation (NAPT, also
   referred to as Port Address Translation or PAT) devices [RFC3022] in
   case the scenario in question involves a non-upgradable pre-existing
   IPv4 home gateway performing NAT/NAPT or some carrier equipment at
   the other end of the access link performing NAT/NAPT.  The L2TPv2
   Softwire (i.e., Control Channel and Session) is capable of NAT/NAPT
   traversal since L2TPv2 can run over UDP.

   Since L2TPv2 does not detect NAT/NAPT along the path, L2TPv2 does not
   offer the option of disabling UDP.  The UDP encapsulation is present
   regardless of NAT/NAPT presence.  Both NAT/NAPT "autodetect" and UDP
   "bypass" are optional requirements in Section 2.3 of [RFC4925].

   As mentioned in Section 8.1 of [RFC2661] and Section 4 of [RFC3193],
   an L2TP SCCRP responder (SC) can chose a different IP address and/or
   UDP port than those from the initiator's SCCRQ (SI).  This may or may
   not traverse a NAT/NAPT depending on the NAT/NAPT's Filtering
   Behavior (see Section 5 of [RFC4787]).  Specifically, any IP address
   and port combination will work with Endpoint-Independent Filtering,
   but changing IP address and port will not work through Address-
   Dependent or Address and Port-Dependent Filtering.  Given this,
   responding from a different IP address and/or UDP port is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.

2.2.  Scalability

   In the "Hub and Spoke" model, a carrier must be able to scale the
   solution to millions of Softwire Initiators by adding more hubs
   (i.e., Softwire Concentrators).  L2TPv2 is a widely deployed protocol
   in broadband services, and its scalability has been proven in
   multiple large-scale IPv4 Virtual Private Network deployments which
   scale up to millions of subscribers each.

2.3.  Routing

   There are no dynamic routing protocols between the SC and SI.  A
   default route from the SI to the SC is used.

2.4.  Multicast

   Multicast protocols simply run over L2TPv2 Softwires transparently
   together with other regular IP traffic.

2.5.  Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA)

   L2TPv2 supports optional mutual Control Channel authentication and
   leverages the optional mutual PPP per-session authentication.  L2TPv2
   is well integrated with AAA solutions (such as RADIUS) for both
   authentication and authorization.  Most L2TPv2 implementations
   available in the market support logging of authentication and
   authorization events.

   L2TPv2 integration with RADIUS accounting (RADIUS Accounting
   extension for tunnel [RFC2867]) allows the collection and reporting
   of L2TPv2 Softwire usage statistics.

2.6.  Privacy, Integrity, and Replay Protection

   Since L2TPv2 runs over IP/UDP in the Softwire context, IPsec ESP can
   be used in conjunction to provide per-packet authentication,
   integrity, replay protection and confidentiality for both L2TPv2
   control and data traffic [RFC3193] and [RFC3948].

   For Softwire deployments in which full payload security is not
   required, the L2TPv2 built-in Control Channel authentication and the
   inherited PPP authentication and PPP Encryption Control Protocol can
   be considered.

2.7.  Operations and Management

   L2TPv2 supports an optional in-band keepalive mechanism which injects
   HELLO control messages after a specified period of time has elapsed



Storer, et al.          Expires September 7, 2009               [Page 8]

Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


   since the last data or control message was received on a tunnel (see
   Section 5.5 of [RFC2661]).  If the HELLO control message is not
   reliably delivered, then the Control Channel and its Session will be
   torn down.  In the Softwire context, the L2TPv2 keepalive is used to
   monitor the connectivity status between the SI and SC and/or as a
   refresh mechanism for any NAT/NAPT translation entry along the access
   link.

   LCP ECHO offers a similar mechanism to monitor the connectivity
   status, as described in [RFC1661].  Softwire implementations SHOULD
   use L2TPv2 Hello keepalives and in addition MAY use PPP LCP Echo
   messages to ensure Dead End Detection and/or to refresh NAT/NAPT
   translation entries.  The combination of these two mechanisms can be
   used as an optimization.

   L2TPv2 MIB [RFC3371] supports the complete suite of management
   operations such as configuration of Control Channel and Session,
   polling of Control Channel and Session status and their traffic
   statistics and notifications of Control Channel and Session UP/DOWN
   events.

2.8.  Encapsulations

   L2TPv2 supports the following encapsulations:

   o  IPv6/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv4

   o  IPv4/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv6

   o  IPv4/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv4

   o  IPv6/PPP/L2TPv2/UDP/IPv6

   Note that UDP bypass is not supported by L2TPv2 since L2TPv2 does not
   support "autodetect" of NAT/NAPT.


3.  Deployment Scenarios

   For the "Hub and Spoke" problem space, four scenarios have been
   identified.  In each of these four scenarios, different home
   equipment plays the role of the Softwire Initiator.  This section
   elaborates each scenario with L2TPv2 as the Softwire protocol and
   other possible protocols involved to complete the solution.  This
   section examines the four scenarios for both IPv6 over IPv4
   (Section 3.1) and IPv4 over IPv6 (Section 3.2) encapsulations.

3.1.  IPv6 over IPv4 Softwires with L2TPv2

   The following subsections cover IPv6 connectivity (SPH) across an
   IPv4-only access network (STH) using a Softwire.

   The Softwire Initiator (SI) is the host CPE (directly connected to a
   modem), which is dual-stack.  There is no other gateway device.  The
   IPv4 traffic SHOULD NOT traverse the Softwire.  See Figure 1.

   Autoconfiguration / Neighbor Discovery runs over the IPv6 over PPP

   In this scenario, after the L2TPv2 Control Channel and Session
   establishment and PPP LCP negotiation (and optionally PPP
   Authentication) are successful, IPCP negotiates IPv4 over PPP which
   also provides the capability for the ISP to assign a global IPv4
   address to the router CPE.  A global IPv4 address can also be
   assigned via DHCP.  Other configuration options (such as DNS) can be
   conveyed to the router CPE via IPCP [RFC1877] or DHCP [RFC2132].  For
   IPv4 Prefix Delegation for the home network, DHCP
   [I-D.ietf-dhc-subnet-alloc] can be used.

3.2.3.  Host behind CPE as Softwire Initiator

   IPv4 connectivity across an IPv6-only access network (STH).  The CPE
   is IPv6-only.  The Softwire Initiator (SI) is a dual-stack host
   (behind the IPv6 CPE), which acts as an IPv4 host CPE.  The IPv6
   traffic SHOULD NOT traverse the Softwire.  See Figure 7.

5.  Softwire Establishment

   A Softwire is established in three distinct steps, potentially
   preceded by an optional IPsec-related step 0 (see Figure 9).  First
   an L2TPv2 tunnel with a single session is established from the SI to
   the SC.  Second a PPP session is established over the L2TPv2 session
   and the SI obtains an address.  Third the SI optionally gets other
   information through DHCP such as a delegated prefix and DNS servers.

   negotiations in step 2 use IPV6CP for IPv6 over IPv4 Softwires, and
   IPCP for IPv4 over IPv6 Softwires (see Section 5.2.4).  The optional
   DHCP negotiations in step 3 use DHCPv6 for IPv6 over IPv4 Softwires,
   and DHCPv4 for IPv4 over IPv6 Softwires (see Section 5.4).
   Additionally, for IPv6 over IPv4 Softwires, the DHCPv6 exchange for
   non-address configuration (such as DNS) can use Stateless DHCPv6, the
   two message exchange with Information-Request and Reply messages (see
   Section 1.2 of [RFC3315] and [RFC3736]).

5.1.  L2TPv2 Tunnel Setup

   L2TPv2 [RFC2661] was originally designed to provide private network
   access to end users connected to a public network.  In the L2TPv2
   incoming call model, the end user makes a connection to an L2TP
   Access Concentrator (LAC).  The LAC then initiates an L2TPv2 tunnel
   to an L2TP Network Server (LNS).  The LNS then transfers end user
   traffic between the L2TPv2 tunnel and the private network.

   In the Softwire "Hub and Spoke" model, the Softwire Initiator (SI)
   assumes the role of the LAC Client and the Softwire Concentrator (SC)
   assumes the role of the LNS.

   In the Softwire model, an L2TPv2 packet MUST be carried over UDP.
   The underlying version of the IP protocol may be IPv4 or IPv6,
   depending on the Softwire scenario.

   In the following sections, the term "Tunnel" follows the definition
   from Section 1.2 of [RFC2661], namely: "The Tunnel consists of a
   Control Connection and zero or more L2TP Sessions".

5.1.1.  Tunnel Establishment

   Figure 11 describes the messages exchanged and Attribute Value Pairs
   (AVPs) used to establish a tunnel between an SI (LAC) and an SC
   (LNS).  The messages and AVPs described here are only a subset of
   those defined in [RFC2661].  This is because Softwires use only a
   subset of the L2TPv2 functionality.  The subset of L2TP Control
   Connection Management AVPs that is applicable to Softwires is grouped
   into Required AVPs and Optional AVPs on a per control message basis
   (see Figure 11).  For each control message, Required AVPs include all
   the "MUST be present" AVPs from [RFC2661] for that control message,
   and Optional AVPs include the "MAY be present" AVPs from [RFC2661]
   that are used in the Softwire context on that control message.  Note
   that in the Softwire environment, the SI always initiates the tunnel.
   L2TPv2 AVPs SHOULD NOT be hidden.

                Figure 11: Control Connection Establishment

   In L2TPv2, generally, the tunnel between an LAC and LNS may carry the
   data of multiple users.  Each of these users is represented by an
   L2TPv2 session within the tunnel.  In the Softwire environment, the
   tunnel carries the information of a single user.  Consequently, there
   is only one L2TPv2 session per tunnel.  Figure 12 describes the
   messages exchanged and the AVPs used to establish a session between
   an SI (LAC) and an SC (LNS).  The messages and AVPs described here
   are only a subset of those defined in [RFC2661].  This is because
   Softwires use only a subset of the L2TPv2 functionality.  The subset
   of L2TP Call Management (i.e., Session Management) AVPs that is
   applicable to Softwires is grouped into Required AVPs and Optional
   AVPs on a per control message basis (see Figure 12).  For each

   control message, Required AVPs include all the "MUST be present" AVPs
   from [RFC2661] for that control message, and Optional AVPs include
   the "MAY be present" AVPs from [RFC2661] that are used in the
   Softwire context on that control message.  Note that in the Softwire
   environment, the SI always initiates the session.  An L2TPv2 session
   setup for a softwire uses only the incoming call model.  No outgoing
   or analog calls (sessions) are permitted.  L2TPv2 AVPs SHOULD NOT be
   hidden.

   The following sub-sections 5.1.1.1 through 5.1.1.3 describe in more
   detail the Control Connection and Session establishment AVPs (see
   message flows in Figures 11 and 12 respectively) that are required,
   optional and not relevant for the L2TPv2 Tunnel establishment of a
   Softwire.  Specific L2TPv2 protocol messages and flows that are not
   explicitly described in these sections are handled as defined in
   [RFC2661].

   The mechanism for hiding AVP Attribute values is used, as describred
   in Section 4.3 of [RFC2661], to hide sensitive control message data
   such as usernames, user passwords or IDs, instead of sending the AVP
   contents in the clear.  Since AVPs used in L2TP messages for the
   Softwire establishment do not transport such sensitive data, L2TPv2
   AVPs SHOULD NOT be hidden.

5.1.1.1.  AVPs Required for Softwires

   This section prescribes specific values for AVPs that are required
   (by [RFC2661]) to be present in one or more of the messages used for
   the Softwire establishment, as they are used in the Softwire context.
   It combines all the Required AVPs from all the control messages on
   Section 5.1.1, and provides Softwire-specific use guidance.

   Host Name AVP

      This AVP is required in SCCRQ and SCCRP messages.  This AVP MAY be
      used to authenticate users, in which case it would contain a user
      identification.  If this AVP is not used to authenticate users, it
      may be used for logging purposes.

   Framing Capabilities AVP

      Both the synchronous (S) and asynchronous (A) bits SHOULD be set
      to 1.  This AVP SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   Framing Type AVP

      The synchronous bit SHOULD be set to 1 and the asynchronous bit to
      0.  This AVP SHOULD be ignored by the receiver.

   (Tx) Connect Speed

      (Tx) Connect Speed is a required AVP but is not meaningful in the
      Softwire context.  Its value SHOULD be set to 0 and ignored by the
      receiver.

   Message Type AVP, Protocol Version AVP, Assigned Tunnel ID AVP, Call
   Serial Number AVP, and Assigned Session ID AVP

      As defined in [RFC2661].

5.1.1.2.  AVPs Optional for Softwires

   This section prescribes specific values for AVPs that are Optional
   (not required by [RFC2661]) but used in the Softwire context.  It
   combines all the Optional AVPs from all the control messages on
   Section 5.1.1, and provides Softwire-specific use guidance.

   Challenge AVP and Challenge Response AVP

      These AVPs are not required, but are necessary to implement tunnel
      authentication.  Since tunnel authentication happens at the
      beginning of L2TPv2 tunnel creation, it can be helpful in

      preventing DoS attacks.  See Section 5.1.1 of [RFC2661].

      The usage of these AVPs in L2TP messages is OPTIONAL, but SHOULD
      be implemented in the SC.

   Receive Window Size AVP, Firmware Revision AVP, and Vendor Name AVP

      As defined in [RFC2661].

5.1.1.3.  AVPs not Relevant for Softwires

   L2TPv2 specifies numerous AVPs that, while allowed for a given
   message, are irrelevant to Softwires.  They can be irrelevant to
   Softwires because they do not apply to the Softwire establishment
   flow (e.g., they are only used in the Outgoing Call establishment
   message exchange, while Softwires only use the Incoming Call message
   flow), or because they are Optional AVPs that are not used.  L2TPv2
   AVPs that are relevant to Softwires were covered in Section 5.1.1,
   Section 5.1.1.1, and Section 5.1.1.2.  Softwire implementations
   SHOULD NOT send AVPs that are not relevant to Softwires.  However,
   they SHOULD ignore them when they are received.  This will simplify
   the creation of Softwire applications that build upon existing L2TPv2
   implementations.

5.1.2.  Tunnel Maintenance

   Periodically, the SI/SC MUST transmit a message to the peer to detect
   tunnel or peer failure and maintain NAT/NAPT contexts.  The L2TPv2
   HELLO message provides a simple, low overhead method of doing this.

   The default values specified in [RFC2661] for L2TPv2 HELLO messages
   could result in a dead end detection time of 83 seconds.  Although
   these retransmission timers and counters SHOULD be configurable (see
   Section 5.8 of [RFC2661]), these values may not be adapted for all
   situations, where a quicker dead end detection is required, or where
   NAT/NAPT context needs to be refreshed more frequently.  In such
   cases, the SI/SC MAY use, in combination with L2TPv2 HELLO, LCP ECHO
   messages (Echo-Request and Echo-Reply codes) described in [RFC1661].
   When used, LCP ECHO messages SHOULD have a re-emission timer lower
   than the value for L2TPv2 HELLO messages.  The default value
   recommended in Section 6.5 of [RFC2661] for the HELLO message
   retransmission interval is 60 seconds.  When used, a set of suggested
   values (included here only for guidance) for the LCP ECHO message
   request interval is a default of 30 seconds, a minimum of 10 seconds,
   and a maximum of the lesser of the configured L2TPv2 HELLO
   retransmission interval and 60 seconds.

Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


5.1.3.  Tunnel Teardown

   Either the SI or SC can teardown the session and tunnel.  This is
   done as specified in Section 5.7 of [RFC2661], by sending a StopCCN
   control message.  There is no action specific to Softwires in this
   case.

5.1.4.  Additional L2TPv2 Considerations

   In the Softwire "Hub and Spoke" framework, L2TPv2 is layered on top
   of UDP, as part of an IP-in-IP tunnel; Section 8.1 of [RFC2661]
   describes L2TP over UDP/IP.  Therefore, the UDP guidelines specified
   in [RFC5405] apply, as they pertain to the UDP tunneling scenarios
   carrying IP-based traffic.  Section 3.1.3 of [RFC5405] specifies that
   for this case, specific congestion control mechanisms for the tunnel
   are not necessary.  Additionally, Section 3.2 of [RFC5405] provides
   message size guidelines for the encapsulating (outer) datagrams,
   including the recommendation to implement Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD).

5.2.  PPP Connection

   This section describes the PPP negotiations between the SI and SC in
   the Softwire context.

5.2.1.  MTU

   The MTU of the PPP link presented to the SPH SHOULD be the link MTU
   minus the size of the IP, UDP, L2TPv2, and PPP headers together.  On
   an IPv4 link with an MTU equal to 1500 bytes, this could typically
   mean a PPP MTU of 1460 bytes.  When the link is managed by IPsec,
   this MTU SHOULD be lowered to take into account the ESP encapsulation
   (see [I-D.ietf-softwire-security-requirements]).  The value for the
   MTU may also vary according to the size of the L2TP header, as
   defined by the leading bits of the L2TP message header (see
   [RFC2661]).  Additionally, see [RFC4623] for a detailed discussion of
   fragmentation issues.

5.2.2.  LCP

   Once the L2TPv2 session is established, the SI and SC initiate the
   PPP connection by negotiating LCP as described in [RFC1661].  The
   Address-and-Control-Field-Compression configuration option (ACFC)
   [RFC1661] MAY be rejected.

5.2.3.  Authentication

   After completing LCP negotiation, the SI and SC MAY optionally
   perform authentication.  If authentication is chosen, CHAP [RFC1994]



Storer, et al.          Expires September 7, 2009              [Page 28]

Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


   authentication MUST be supported by both the Softwire Initiator and
   Softwire Concentrator.  Other authentication methods such as MS-
   CHAPv1 [RFC2433], and EAP [RFC3748] MAY be supported.

   A detailed discussion of Softwire security is contained in
   [I-D.ietf-softwire-security-requirements].

5.2.4.  IPCP

   The only Network Control Protocol (NCP) negotiated in the Softwire
   context is IPV6CP (see Section 5.2.4.1) for IPv6 as SPH, and IPCP
   (see Section 5.2.4.2) for IPv4 as SPH.

5.2.4.1.  IPV6CP

   In the IPv6 over IPv4 scenarios (see Section 3.1), after the optional
   authentication phase, the Softwire Initiator MUST negotiate IPV6CP as
   defined in [RFC5072].  IPV6CP provides a way to negotiate a unique
   64-bit Interface-Identifier to be used for the address
   autoconfiguration at the local end of the link.

5.2.4.2.  IPv4CP

   In the IPv4 over IPv6 scenarios (see Section 3.2), a Softwire
   Initiator MUST negotiate IPCP [RFC1332].  The SI uses IPCP to obtain
   an IPv4 address from the SC.  IPCP MAY also be used to obtain DNS
   information as described in [RFC1877].

5.3.  Global IPv6 Address Assignment to Endpoints

   In several scenarios defined in Section 3.1, Global IPv6 addresses
   are expected to be allocated to Softwire endpoints (in addition to
   the Link-Local addresses autoconfigured using the IPV6CP negotiated
   interface identifier).  The Softwire Initiator assigns global IPv6
   addresses using the IPV6CP negotiated interface identifier and using
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4862], and/or using Privacy
   Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC4941], (as
   described in Section 5 of [RFC5072]), and/or using DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

   The Softwire Initiator of an IPv6 Softwire MUST send a Router
   Solicitation message to the Softwire Concentrator after IPV6CP is
   completed.  The Softwire Concentrator MUST answer with a Router
   Advertisement.  This message MUST contains the global IPv6 prefix of
   the PPP link if Neighbor Discovery is used to configure addresses of
   Softwire endpoints.

   If DHCPv6 is available for address delegation, the M bits of the
   Router Advertisement SHOULD be set.  The Softwire Initiator MUST then



Storer, et al.          Expires September 7, 2009              [Page 29]

Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


   send a DHCPv6 Request to configure the address of the Softwire
   endpoint.

   Duplicate Address Detection ([RFC4861]) MUST be performed on the
   Softwire in both cases.

5.4.  DHCP

   The Softwire Initiator MAY use DHCP to get additional information
   such as delegated prefix and DNS servers.

5.4.1.  DHCPv6

   In the scenarios in Section 3.1, if the SI supports DHCPv6, it SHOULD
   send a Solicit message to verify if more information is available.

   If an SI establishing an IPv6 Softwire acts as a router (i.e., in the
   scenarios in Section 3.1.2 and Section 3.1.4) it MUST include the
   IA_PD option [RFC3633] in the DHCPv6 Solicit message [RFC3315] in
   order to request an IPv6 prefix.

   When delegating an IPv6 prefix to the SI by returning a DHCPv6
   Advertise message with the IA_PD and IP_PD Prefix options [RFC3633],
   the SC SHOULD inject a route for this prefix in the IPv6 routing
   table in order to forward the traffic to the relevant Softwire.

   Configuration of DNS MUST be done as specified in [RFC3646] and
   transmitted according to [RFC3315] and [RFC3736].  In general, all
   DHCPv6 options MUST be transmitted according to [RFC3315] and
   [RFC3736].

5.4.2.  DHCPv4

   An SI establishing an IPv4 Softwire MAY send a DHCP request
   containing the Subnet Allocation option [I-D.ietf-dhc-subnet-alloc].
   This practice is not common but may be used to connect IPv4 subnets
   using Softwires, as defined in Section 3.2.2 and Section 3.2.4.

   One Subnet-Request suboption MUST be configured with the 'h' bit set
   to '1', as the SI is expected to perform the DHCP server function.
   The 'i' bit of the Subnet-Request suboption SHOULD be set to '0' the
   first time a prefix is requested and to '1' on subsequent requests,
   if a prefix has been allocated.  The Prefix length suboption SHOULD
   be 0 by default.  If the SI is configured to support only specific
   prefix lengths, it SHOULD specify the longest (smallest) prefix
   length it supports.

   If the SI was previously assigned a prefix from that same SC, it



Storer, et al.          Expires September 7, 2009              [Page 30]

Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


   SHOULD include the Subnet-Information suboption with the prefix it
   was previously assigned.  The 'c' and 's' bits of the suboption
   SHOULD be set to '0'.

   In the scenarios in Section 3.2, when delegating an IPv4 prefix to
   the SI, the SC SHOULD inject a route for this prefix in the IPv4
   routing table in order to forward the traffic to the relevant
   Softwire.


6.  Considerations about the Address Provisioning Model

   This section describes how a Softwire Concentrator may manage
   delegated addresses for Softwire endpoints and for subnets behind the
   Softwire Initiator.  One common practice is to aggregate endpoints'
   addresses and delegated prefixes into one prefix routed to the SC.
   The main benefit is to ease the routing scheme by isolating on the SC
   succeeding route injections (when delegating new prefixes for SI).

6.1.  Softwire Endpoints' Addresses

6.1.1.  IPv6

   A Softwire Concentrator should provide globally routable addresses to
   Softwire endpoints.  Other types of addresses such as Unique Local
   Addresses (ULA) [RFC4193] may be used to address Softwire endpoints
   in a private network with no global connectivity.  A single /64
   should be assigned to the Softwire to address both Softwire
   endpoints.

   Global or ULA addresses must be assigned to endpoints when the
   scenario "Host CPE as Softwire Initiator" (described in
   Section 3.1.1) is considered to be deployed.  For other scenarios,
   link local addresses may also be used.

6.1.2.  IPv4

   A Softwire Concentrator may provide either globally routable or
   private IPv4 addresses.  When using IPv4 private addresses [RFC1918]
   on the endpoints, it is not recommended to delegate an IPv4 private
   prefix to the SI, as it can lead to a nested-NAT situations.

   The endpoints of the PPP link use host addresses (i.e., /32),
   negotiated using IPCP.

Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


6.2.  Delegated Prefixes

6.2.1.  IPv6 Prefixes

   Delegated IPv6 prefixes should be of global scope if the IPv6
   addresses assigned to endpoints are global.  Using ULA addresses is
   not recommended when the subnet is connected to the global IPv6
   Internet.  When using ULA IPv6 address for endpoint, the delegated
   IPv6 prefix may be either of Global or ULA scope.

   Delegated IPv6 prefixes are between /48 and /64 in length.  When an
   SI receives a prefix shorter than 64, it can assign different /64
   prefixes to each of its interfaces.  An SI receiving a single /64 is
   expected to perform bridging if more than one interface are available
   (e.g., wired and wireless).

6.2.2.  IPv4 Prefixes

   Delegated IPv4 prefixes should be routable within the address space
   used by assigned IPv4 addresses.  Delegate non-routable IPv4 prefixes
   (i.e., private IPv4 prefix over public IPv4 addresses or another
   class of private IPv4 addresses) is not recommended as a practice for
   provisioning and address translation should be considered in these
   cases.  The prefix length is between /8 and /30.

6.3.  Possible Address Provisioning Scenarios

   This section summarizes the different scenarios for address
   provisioning with the considerations given in the previous sections.

7.  Considerations about Address Stability

   A Softwire can provide stable addresses even if the underlying
   addressing scheme changes, by opposition to automatic tunneling.  A
   Softwire Concentrator should always provide the same address and
   prefix to a reconnecting user.  However, if the goal of the Softwire
   service is to provide a temporary address for a roaming user, it may
   be provisioned to provide only a temporary address.

   The address and prefix are expected to change when reconnecting to a
   different Softwire Concentrator.  However an organization providing a
   Softwire service may provide the same address and prefix across
   different Softwire Concentrators at the cost of a more fragmented

   routing table.  The routing fragmentation issue may be limited if the
   prefixes are aggregated in a location topologically close to the SC.
   This would be the case for example if several SCs are put in parallel
   for load-balancing purpose.


8.  Considerations about RADIUS Integration

   The Softwire Concentrator is expected to act as a client to a AAA
   server, for example a RADIUS server.  During the PPP authentication
   phase, the RADIUS server may return additional information in the
   form of attributes in the Access-Accept message.

   The Softwire Concentrator may include the Tunnel-Type and Tunnel-
   Medium-Type attributes [RFC2868] in the Access-Request messages to
   provide a hint of the type of Softwire being configured.

8.1.  Softwire Endpoints

8.1.1.  IPv6 Softwires

   If the RADIUS server includes a Framed-Interface-Id attribute
   [RFC3162], the Softwire Concentrator must send it to the Softwire
   Initiator in the Interface-Identifier field of its IPV6CP
   Configuration Request message.

   If the Framed-IPv6-Prefix attribute [RFC3162] is included, that
   prefix must be used in the router advertisements sent to the SI.  If
   Framed-IPv6-Prefix is not present but Framed-IPv6-Pool is, the SC
   must choose a prefix from that pool to send RAs.

   If none of the attributes above are included but the AAA server
   returns the Tunnel-Client-Endpoint and Tunnel-Server-Endpoint
   attributes [RFC2868] with the correct address family, these must be
   used in the IPV6CP Interface-Identifier and for the Router
   Advertisements.

8.1.2.  IPv4 Softwires

   If the Framed-IP-Address attribute [RFC2865] is present, the Softwire
   Concentrator must provide that address to the Softwire Initiator
   during IPCP address negotiation.  That is, when the Softwire
   Initiator requests an IP address from the Softwire Concentrator, the
   address provided should be the Framed-IP-Address.

   If the Framed-IP-Address attribute is not present and the Tunnel-
   Client-Endpoint and Tunnel-Server-Endpoint attributes [RFC2868] are
   present and of the correct address family, these should be used in

Internet-Draft    Softwire H & S Framework with L2TPv2        March 2009


   the IPCP IP-Address configuration option.

8.2.  Delegated Prefixes

8.2.1.  IPv6 Prefixes

   If the attribute Delegated-IPv6-Prefix [RFC4818] is present in the
   RADIUS Access-Accept message, it must be used by the Softwire
   Concentrator for the delegation of the IPv6 prefix.  Since the prefix
   delegation is performed by DHCPv6 and the attribute is linked to a
   username, the SC must associate the DHCP Unique Identifier (DUID) of
   a DHCPv6 request to the tunnel it came from and its user.

   Interaction between RADIUS, PPP and DHCPv6 server may follow the
   mechanism proposed in [I-D.ietf-dhc-v6-relay-radius].  In this case,
   during the Softwire authentication phase, PPP collects the RADIUS
   attributes for the user such as Delegated-IPv6-Prefix.  A specific
   DHCPv6 relay is assigned to the Softwire.  The DHCPv6 relay fills in
   these attributes in the Relay agent RADIUS Attribute Option (RRAO)
   DHCPv6 option, before forwarding the DHCPv6 requests to the DHCPv6
   server.

8.2.2.  IPv4 Prefixes

   The combination of the Framed-IP-Address and Framed-IP-Netmask
   attributes [RFC2865] may be used by the Softwire Concentrator to
   delegate an IPv4 prefix to the Softwire Initiator.


9.  Considerations for Maintenance and Statistics

   Existing protocol mechanics for conveying adjunct or accessory
   information for logging purposes, including L2TPv2 and RADIUS
   methods, can include informational text that the behavior is
   according to the Softwire "Hub and Spoke" framework (following the
   implementation details specified in this document).

9.1.  RADIUS Accounting

   RADIUS Accounting for L2TP and PPP are documented (see Section 4.3).

   When deploying Softwire solutions, operators may experience
   difficulties to differentiate the address family of the traffic
   reported in accounting information from RADIUS.  This problem and
   some potential solutions are described in
   [I-D.stevant-softwire-accounting].

9.2.  MIBs

   MIB support for L2TPv2 and PPP are documented (see Section 4.4).
   Also see [RFC4293].


10.  Security Considerations

   One design goal of the "Hub and Spoke" problem is to very strongly
   consider the reuse of already deployed protocols (see [RFC4925]).
   Another design goal is a solution with very high scaling properties.
   L2TPv2 [RFC2661] is the phase 1 protocol used in the Softwire "Hub
   and Spoke" solution space, and the L2TPv2 security considerations
   apply to this document (see Section 9 of [RFC2661]).

   The L2TPv2 Softwire solution adds the following considerations:

   o  L2TP Tunnel Authentication (see Sections 5.1.1 and 9.1 of
      [RFC2661]) provides authentication at tunnel setup.  It may be
      used to limit DoS attacks by authenticating the tunnel before L2TP
      and PPP resources are allocated.

   o  In a Softwire environment, L2TPv2 AVPs do not transport sensitive
      data, and thus the L2TPv2 AVP hiding mechanism is not used (see
      Section 5.1.1).

   o  PPP CHAP [RFC1994] provides basic user authentication.  Other
      authentication protocols may additionally be supported (see
      Section 5.2.3).

   L2TPv2 can also be secured with IPsec, to provide privacy, integrity,
   and replay protection.  Currently, there are two different solutions
   for security L2TPv2 with IPsec:

   o  Securing L2TPv2 using IPsec "version 2" (RFC 24xx/IKEv1) is
      specified in [RFC3193], [RFC3947] and [RFC3948].  When L2TPv2 is
      used in the Softwire context, the voluntary tunneling model
      applies.  [RFC3193] describes the interaction between IPsec and
      L2TPv2, and is deployed.  [RFC3193] MUST be supported, given that
      deployed technology must be very strongly considered [RFC4925] for
      this 'time-to-market' solution.

   o  [I-D.ietf-softwire-security-requirements] also specifies a new
      (incompatible) solution for securing L2TPv2 with IPsec "version 3"
      (RFC 43xx/IKEv2).  Section 3.5 of
      [I-D.ietf-softwire-security-requirements] describes the
      advantanges of using IKEv2, and this solution needs to be
      considered for future phases.
