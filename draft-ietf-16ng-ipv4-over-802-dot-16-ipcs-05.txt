Abstract

   IEEE 802.16 is an air interface specification for wireless broadband
   access.  IEEE 802.16 has specified multiple service specific
   Convergence Sublayers for transmitting upper layer protocols.  The
   packet CS (Packet Convergence Sublayer) is used for the transport of
   all packet-based protocols such as Internet Protocol (IP), IEEE 802.3
   (Ethernet) and IEEE 802.1Q (VLAN).  The IP-specific part of the
   Packet CS enables the transport of IPv4 packets directly over the
   IEEE 802.16 MAC.

   This document specifies the frame format, the Maximum Transmission
   Unit (MTU) and address assignment procedures for transmitting IPv4
   packets over the IP-specific part of the Packet Convergence Sublayer
   of IEEE 802.16.

Internet-Draft        IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IP CS            June 2009


1.  Introduction

   IEEE 802.16 [IEEE802_16] is a connection oriented access technology
   for the last mile.  The IEEE 802.16 specification includes the PHY
   and MAC layers.  The MAC includes various Convergence Sublayers (CS)
   for transmitting higher layer packets including IPv4 packets
   [IEEE802_16].

   The scope of this specification is limited to the operation of IPv4
   over the IP-specific part of the packet CS (referred to as "IPv4 CS"
   or simply "IP CS" in this document).

   This document specifies a method for encapsulating and transmitting
   IPv4 [RFC0791] packets over the IP CS of IEEE 802.16.  This document
   also specifies the MTU and address assignment method for the IEEE
   802.16 based networks using IP CS.

   This document also discusses ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) and
   Multicast Address Mapping whose operations are similar to any other
   point-to-point link model.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Terminology

   The terminology in this document is based on the definitions in
   [RFC5154].


3.  Typical Network Architecture for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16

   The network architecture follows what is described in [RFC5154] and
   [RFC5121].  In a nutshell, each MS is attached to an Access Router
   (AR) through a Base Station (BS), a layer 2 entity (from the
   perspective of the IPv6 link between the MS and access router (AR)).

   For further information on the typical network architecture, see
   [RFC5121] section 5.

3.1.  IEEE 802.16 IPv4 Convergence Sublayer Support

   As described in [IEEE802_16], the IP-specific part of the packet CS
   allows the transmission of either IPv4 or IPv6 payloads.  In this
   document, we are focusing on the IPv4 over Packet Convergence
   Sublayer.

   For further information on the IEEE 802.16 Convergence Sublayer and
   encapsulation of IP packets, see [RFC5121] section 4 and [RFC5154]
   section 3.3.


4.  IPv4 CS link in 802.16 Networks

   This document defines the IPv4 CS link as a point-to-point link
   between the MS and the AR using a set of service flows consisting of
   MAC transport connections between a MS and BS, and L2 tunnel(s)
   between a BS and AR.  It is recommended that a tunnel be established
   between the AR and a BS based on 'per MS' or 'per service flow' (An
   MS can have multiple service flows each of which are identified by a
   unique service flow ID).  Then the tunnel(s) for an MS, in
   combination with the MS's MAC transport connections, forms a single
   point-to-point link.  Each MS belongs to a different link and is
   assigned an unique IPv4 address per recommendations in [RFC4968].

   To summarize:

   o  IPv4 CS uses the IPv4 header fields to classify the packets and
      map to the appropriate CID.
   o  A point-to-point link between MS and AR is established.

4.1.  IPv4 CS link establishment

   In order to enable the sending and receiving of IPv4 packets between
   the MS and the AR, the link between the MS and the AR via the BS
   needs to be established.  This section explains the link
   establishment procedures following section 6.2 of [RFC5121].  Steps
   1-4 are same as indicated in 6.2 of [RFC5121].  In step 5, support
   for IPv4 is indicated.  In step 6, an initial service flow is created
   that can be used for exchanging IP layer signaling messages, e.g.
   address assignment procedures using DHCP.

   The address assignment procedure depends on the MS mode - i,e.
   whether it is acting as a Mobile IPv4 client or a Proxy Mobile IP
   client or a Simple IP client.  In the most common case, the MS
   requests an IP address using DHCP.

4.2.  Frame Format for IPv4 Packets

   IPv4 packets are transmitted in Generic IEEE 802.16 MAC frames in the
   data payloads of the 802.16 PDU ( see section 3.2 of [RFC5154] ).

4.3.  Maximum Transmission Unit

      The MTU value for IPv4 packets on an IEEE 802.16 link is
   configurable.  The default MTU for IPv4 packets over an IEEE 802.16
      link SHOULD be 1500 octets.

Internet-Draft        IPv4 over IEEE 802.16's IP CS            June 2009


   Per [RFC5121] section 6.3, the IP MTU can vary to be larger or
   smaller than 1500 octets.

   if an MS transmits 1500-octet packets in a deployment with a smaller
   MTU, packets from the MS may be dropped at the link-layer silently.
   Unlike IPv6, in which departures from the default MTU are readily
   advertised via the MTU option in Neighbor Discovery, there is no
   similarly reliable mechanism in IPv4, as the legacy IPv4 client
   implementations do not determine the link MTU by default before
   sending packets.  Even though there is a DHCP option to accomplish
   this, DHCP servers are required to provide the MTU information only
   when requested.

   Discovery and configuration of the proper link MTU value ensures
   adequate usage of the network bandwidth and resources.  Accordingly,
   deployments should avoid packet loss due to a mismatch between the
   default MTU and the configured link MTUs.

      Some of the mechanisms available for the IPv4 CS host to find out
   the link's MTU value and mitigate MTU-related issues are:

   o  The IEEE is currently revising 802.16 (see 802.16Rev2
      [802_16REV2]) to (among other things) allow providing the Service
      Data Unit or MAC MTU in the IEEE 802.16 SBC-REQ/SBC-RSP phase,
      such that future IEEE 802.16 compliant clients can infer and
      configure the negotiated MTU size for the IPv4 CS link.  However,
      the implementation must communicate the negotiated MTU value to
      the IP layer to adjust the IP Maximum payload size for proper
      handling of fragmentation.  Note that this method is useful only
      when MS is directly connected to the BS.
   o  Configuration and negotiation of MTU size at the network layer by
      using the DHCP interface MTU option [RFC2132].

   This document recommends that all future implementations of IPv4 and
   IPv4 CS clients SHOULD implement the DHCP interface MTU option
   [RFC2132] in order to configure its interface MTU accordingly.

   In the absence of DHCP MTU configuration, the client node (MS) has
   two alternatives: 1) use the default MTU (1500 bytes) or 2) determine
   the MTU by the methods described in [802_16REV2].

   Additionally, the clients are encouraged to run PMTU [RFC1191] or
   PPMTUD [RFC4821].  However, the PMTU mechanism has inherent problems
   of packet loss due to ICMP messages not reaching the sender and IPv4
   routers not fragmenting the packets due to the DF bit being set in
   the IP packet.  The above mentioned path MTU mechanisms will take
   care of the MTU size between the MS and its correspondent node across
   different flavors of convergence layers in the access networks.

5.  Subnet Model and IPv4 Address Assignment

   The Subnet Model recommended for IPv4 over IEEE 802.16 using IP CS is
   based on the point-to-point link between MS and AR [RFC4968], hence
   each MS shall be assigned an address with 32bit prefix-length or
   subnet-mask.  The point-to-point link between MS and AR is achieved
   using a set of IEEE 802.16 MAC connections (identified by CIDs) and
   an L2 tunnel (e.g., a GRE tunnel) per MS between BS and AR.  If the
   AR is co-located with the BS, then the set of IEEE 802.16 MAC
   connections between the MS and BS/AR represent the point-to- point
   connection.

5.1.  IPv4 Unicast Address Assignment and Router Discovery

   DHCP [RFC2131] SHOULD be used for assigning IPv4 address for the MS.
   DHCP messages are transported over the IEEE 802.16 MAC connection to
   and from the BS and relayed to the AR.  In case the DHCP server does
   not reside in the AR, the AR SHOULD implement DHCP relay Agent
   [RFC1542].

   Although DHCP is the recommended method of address assignment, it is
   possible that the MS could be a pure Mobile IPv4 [RFC3344] device
   which will be offered an IP address from its home network after
   successful Mobile IP [RFC3344] registration.  In such situations, the
   mobile host SHOULD use the default link MTU in order to avoid any
   link-layer packet loss due to larger than supported packet size in
   the IP CS link.

   Router discovery messages [RFC1256] contain router solicitation and
   router advertisements.  The Router solicitation messages (multicast
   or broadcast) from the MS are delivered to the AR via the BS through
   the point-to-point link.  The BS SHOULD map the all-routers multicast
   nodes or broadcast nodes for router discovery to the AR's IP address
   and deliver directly to the AR.  Similarly a router advertisement to
   the all-nodes multicast nodes will be either unicast to each MS by
   the BS separately or put onto a multicast connection to which all MSs
   are listening to.  If no multicast connection exists, and the BS does
   not have the capability to aggregate and disaggregate the messages to
   and from the MS hosts, then the AR implementation must ensure that
   unicast messages are sent to the corresponding individual MS hosts
   within the set of broadcast or multicast recipients.  This
   specification simply assumes that the multicast service is provided.
   How the multicast service is implemented in an IEEE 802.16 Packet CS
   deployment is out of scope of this document.

   The 'Next hop' IP address of the IP CS MS is always the IP address of
   the AR, because MS and AR are attached via a point-to-point link.

5.2.  Address Resolution Protocol

   The IP CS does not allow for transmission of ARP [RFC0826] packets.
   Furthermore, in a point-to-point link model, address resolution is
   not needed.

5.3.  IP Multicast Address Mapping

   IPv4 multicast packets are carried over the point-to-point link
   between the AR and the MS (via the BS).  The IPv4 multicast packets
   are classified normally at the IP CS if the IEEE 802.16 MAC
   connection has been set up with a multicast IP address as a
   classification parameter for the destination IP address.  The IPv4
   multicast address may be mapped into a multicast CID as defined in
   the IEEE 802.16 specification.  The mapping mechanism at the BS or
   the relative efficiency of using a multicast CID as opposed to
   simulating multicast by generating multiple unicast messages are out
   of scope of this document.  For further considerations on the use of
   multicast CIDs see [I-D.ietf-16ng-ip-over-ethernet-over-802-dot-16].


6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies transmission of IPv4 packets over IEEE 802.16
   networks with IPv4 Convergence Sublayer and does not introduce any
   new vulnerabilities to IPv4 specifications or operation.  The
   security of the IEEE 802.16 air interface is the subject of
   [IEEE802_16].  In addition, the security issues of the network
   architecture spanning beyond the IEEE 802.16 base stations is the
   subject of the documents defining such architectures, such as WiMAX
   Network Architecture [WMF].


7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.

Appendix A.  Multiple Convergence Layers - Impact on Subnet Model

   Two different MSs using two different Convergence Sublayers (e.g. an
   MS using Ethernet CS only and another MS using IP CS only) cannot
   communicate at data link layer and requires interworking at IP layer.
   For this reason, these two nodes must be configured to be on two
   different subnets.  For more information refer to [RFC4840].


Appendix B.  Sending and Receiving IPv4 Packets

   IEEE 802.16 MAC is a point-to-multipoint connection oriented air-
   interface, and the process of sending and receiving of IPv4 packets
   is different from multicast-capable shared medium technologies like
   Ethernet.

   Before any packets are transmitted, a IEEE 802.16 transport
   connection must be established.  This connection consists of IEEE
   802.16 MAC transport connection between MS and BS and an L2 tunnel
   between BS and AR (if these two are not co-located).  This IEEE
   802.16 transport connection provides a point-to-point link between
   the MS and AR.  All the packets originated at the MS always reach the

   AR before being transmitted to the final destination.

   IPv4 packets are carried directly in the payload of IEEE 802.16
   frames when the IPv4 CS is used.  IPv4 CS classifies the packet based
   on upper layer (IP and transport layers) header fields to place the
   packet on one of the available connections identified by the CID.
   The classifiers for the IPv4 CS are source and destination IPv4
   addresses, source and destinations ports, Type-of-Service and IP
   protocol field.  The CS may employ Packet Header Suppression (PHS)
   after the classification.

   The BS optionally reconstructs the payload header if PHS is in use.
   It then tunnels the packet that has been received on a particular MAC
   connection to the AR.  Similarly the packets received on a tunnel
   interface from the AR, would be mapped to a particular CID using the
   IPv4 classification mechanism.

   AR performs normal routing for the packets that it receives,
   processing them per its forwarding table.  However, the DHCP relay
   agent in the AR MUST maintain the tunnel interface on which it
   receives DHCP requests so that it can relay the DHCP responses to the
   correct MS.  One way of doing this is to have a mapping between MAC
   address and Tunnel Identifier.


Appendix C.  WiMAX IPCS MTU size

   WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) forum has
   defined a network architecture[WMF].  Furthermore, WiMAX has
   specified IPv4 CS support for transmission of IPv4 packets between MS
   and BS over the IEEE 802.16 link.  The WiMAX IPv4 CS and this
   specification are similar.  One significant difference, however, is
   that the WiMAX Forum [WMF] has specified the IP MTU as 1400 octets
   [WMF] as opposed to 1500 in this specification.

   Hence if an IPv4 CS MS configured with an MTU of 1500 octet enters a
   WiMAX network, some of the issues mentioned in this specification may
   arise.  As mentioned in section 4.3, the possible mechanisms are not
   guaranteed to work.  Furthermore, an IPv4 CS client is not capable of
   doing ARP probing to find out the link MTU.  On the other hand, it is
   imperative for an MS to know the link MTU size.  In practice, MS
   should be able to sense or deduce the fact that they are operating
   within a WiMAX network (e.g., given the WiMAX-specific
   particularities of the authentication and network entry procedures),
   and adjust their MTU size accordingly.  This document makes no
   further assumptions in this respect.

Appendix D.  Thoughts on handling multicast-broadcast IP packets

   Although this document does not directly specify details of multicast
   or broadcast packet handling, here are some suggestions:

   While uplink connections from the MSs to the BS provide only unicast
   transmission capabilities, downlink connections can be used for
   multicast transmission to a group of MSs as well as unicast
   transmission from the BS to a single MS.  For all-node IP addresses,
   the AR or BS should have special mapping and the packets should be
   distributed to all active point-to-point connections by the AR or by
   the BS.  All-router multicast packets and any broadcast packets from
   a MS will be forwarded to the AR by the BS.  If BS and MS are co-
   located, then the first approach is more useful.  If the AR and BS
   are located separately then the second approach should be
   implemented.  An initial capability exchange message should be
   performed between BS and AR (if they are not co-located) to determine
   who would perform the distribution of multicast/broadcast packets.
   Such mechansim should be part of L2 exchange during the connection
   setup and is out of scope of this document.  In order to save energy
   of the wireless end devices in the IEEE 802.16 wireless network, it
   is recommened that the multicast and broadcast from network side to
   device side should be reduced.  Only DHCP, IGMP, Router advertisemnet
   packets are allowed on the downlink for multicast and broadcast IP
   addresses.  Other protocols using multicast and broadcast IP
   addresses should be permitted through local AR/BS configuration.
