                 A Yang model for I2RS service topology
                draft-hares-i2rs-service-topo-dm-04.txt

Abstract

   This document defines I2RS protocol-independent service layer virtual
   topology data model.  This data model utilizes the concepts in the
   generic I2RS topology model of virtual networks (node, links,
   termination points) and cross-layer topologies.  This virtual service
   topology may be a composite layer created from the combination of
   protocol-dependent service layers.  Protocol-dependent services
   layers include: L3VPN, L2VPN, EVPN, E-Tree, and others.

1.  Introduction

   Service topology in [I-D.ietf-i2rs-yang-network-topo] includes the a
   virtual topology for a service layer above the L1, L2, and L3 layers.
   This virtual topology has the generic topology elements of node,
   link, and terminating point.  The virtual service topology is a
   network-wide topology stored on one routing system which an I2RS
   agent is connected to.

   The virtual service topology is a composite summary of the services
   available services gathered from the lower layer indications of
   L3VPN, L2VPN, and EVPN services, E-TREE services, Seamless MPLS
   topologies within an As and others.  This is a "bottoms up" yang
   module providing composite protocol independent service topology
   based on these protocol services.  This yang data model does not
   connect directly to upper service levels such as the L3 Service yang
   data model [I-D.ietf-l3sm-l3vpn-service-model].

2.  High level Yang architecture

   This section describes the Yang High level architecture.

2.1.  Network level

   The service topology network level defines the following high-level
   yang architeture:

   module: i2rs-service-topologies
      augment /nw:network/nw:network-types:
         +--rw service-topologies-types
      augment /nw:network:
        +--rw service-topology-attributes
            +--rw name?   string
                    +--rw flag        flag_type;
                    +--rw composite-flag identity-ref
                    +--rw service-topo-id network-id
                    +--rw node-count  uint32
                    +--rw composite-flag_status identity-ref

   The service topology attributes for a network include the following

Internet-Draft            I2RS Service Topology             January 2016


      name - name of the service topology,

      flag - generic topology flag,

      composite-flags - bit mask with flags of service layer topologies
      network topology node available to create service topology from.
      These topologies include: L3VPN, L2VPN, and EVPN services, E-TREE
      services, Seamless MPLS topologies within an AS and others.

      service-topo-id - service topology identifier.

      node-count - count of nodes in composite service topology,

      composite-flag_status - status flag for each of the composite
      topologies on whether portions of the topology are included in the
      composite.

2.2.  Node level

   module: i2rs-service-topologies
   ....
      augment /nw:network/nw:node
         +--rw node-service-attributes
            +--rw name?        inet:domain-name
            +--rw composite_flag*  identityref;
                    +--rw service-node-id  uint32
                    +--rw node-svc_status* identityref;

   The additional fields in the service attributes are the following:

      name - name of network node,

      flag - generic topology node flag,

      service-node-id - the id for the service node in the composite
      network,

      node-svc-type - the type of service node.  The service node can be
      a member of one of the existing topology type (L3VPN, L2VPN, EVPN,
      E-TREE, Seamless MPLS, MPLS-TE, MPLS node, or I2RS created).

2.3.  Service Link and Termination point

      augment /nw:network/nt:link:
         +--rw service-link-attributes
            +--rw name?     string
            +--rw svc-link-type identityref
            +--rw metric?   uint32
      augment /nw:network/nw:node/nt:termination-point:
         +--rw service-termination-point-attributes
                +--rw tp-svc-id
            +--rw (supporting-termination-point) ()
               +--:(service)
                           |  +--rw service-network-id  leafref
               |  +--rw service-node-id     leafref
                           |  +--rw service-tp-id       leafref
                           +--:(ip)
                           |  +--rw ip-address   inet:ip-address
               +--:(unnumbered)
                  +--rw unnumbered-id?   uint32

   The augmentation to the service topology is the service link
   attributes which include:

      name - name of the link,

      svc-link-type - the service link type used to create this
      composite service link.

      metric - the metric of the service type

   The augmentation to the termination point include the following

      tp-svc-id - service id for the termination point,

      supporting termination point* - with a)references to the service
      network id, node id and termination point for service id, or b) an
      ip address, or c) an unnumbered link address
