     A Solution Framework for Private Media in Privacy Enhanced RTP
                              Conferencing
               draft-ietf-perc-private-media-framework-00

Abstract

   This document describes a solution framework for ensuring that media
   confidentiality and integrity are maintained end-to-end within the
   context of a switched conferencing environment where media
   distribution devices are not trusted with the end-to-end media
   encryption keys.  The solution aims to build upon existing security
   mechanisms defined for the real-time transport protocol (RTP).

1.  Introduction

   Switched conferencing is an increasingly popular model for multimedia
   conferences with multiple participants using a combination of audio,
   video, text, and other media types.  With this model, real-time media
   flows from conference participants are not mixed, transcoded,
   transrated, recomposed, or otherwise manipulated by a media

   distribution device (MDD), as might be the case with a traditional
   media server or multipoint control unit (MCU).  Instead, media flows
   transmitted by conference participants are simply forwarded by the
   MDD to each of the other participants, often forwarding only a subset
   of flows based on voice activity detection or other criteria.  In
   some instances, the MDDs may make limited modifications to RTP
   [RFC3550] headers, for example, but the actual media content (e.g.,
   voice or video data) is unaltered.

   An advantage of switched conferencing is that media distribution
   devices can be more easily deployed on general-purpose computing
   hardware, including virtualized environments in private and public
   clouds.  Deploying conference resources in a public cloud environment
   might introduce a higher security risk.  Whereas traditional
   conference resources were usually deployed in private networks that
   were protected, cloud-based conference resources might be viewed as
   less secure since they are not always physically controlled by those
   who use them.  Additionally, there are usually several ports open to
   the public in cloud deployments, such as for remote administration,
   and so on.

   This document defines a solution framework wherein media privacy is
   ensured by making it impossible for an media distribution device to
   gain access to keys needed to decrypt or authenticate the actual
   media content sent between conference participants.  At the same
   time, the framework allows for the media distribution device to
   modify certain RTP headers; add, remove, encrypt, or decrypt RTP
   header extensions; and encrypt and decrypt RTCP packets.  The
   framework also prevents replay attacks by authenticating each packet
   transmitted between a given participant and the media distribution
   device using a unique key per endpoint that is independent from the
   key for media encryption and authentication.

   A goal of this document is to define a framework for enhanced privacy
   in RTP-based conferencing environments while utilizing existing
   security procedures defined for RTP with minimal enhancements.

   E2E (End-to-End): Communications from one endpoint through one or
   more Media Distribution Devices to the endpoint at the other end.

   HBH (Hop-by-Hop): Communications between an endpoint and an Media
   Distribution Device or between Media Distribution Devices.

   Endpoint: An RTP flow terminating entity that has possession of E2E
   media encryption keys and terminates E2E encryption.  This may
   include embedded user conferencing equipment or browsers on
   computers, media gateways, MCUs, media recording device and more that
   are in the trusted domain for a given deployment.

   MDD (Media Distribution Device): An RTP middlebox that is not allowed
   to to have access to E2E encryption keys.  It may operate according
   to any of the RTP topologies [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-topologies-update]
   per the constraints defined by the PERC system, which includes, but
   not limited to, having no access to RTP media unencrypted and having
   limits on what RTP header field it can alter.

   KMF (Key Management Function): An entity that is a logical function
   which passes keying material and related information to endpoints and
   Media Distribution Devices that is appropriate for each.  The KMF
   might be co-resident with another entity trusted with E2E keying
   material.

   Conference: Two or more participants communicating via trusted
   endpoints to exchange RTP flows through one or more Media
   Distribution Devices.

   Third Party: Any entity that is not an Endpoint, MDD, KMF or Call
   Processing entity as described in this document.

3.  PERC Entities and Trust Model

   The following figure depicts the trust relationships, direct or
   indirect, between entities described in the subsequent sub-sections.
   Note that these entities may be co-located or further divided into
   multiple, separate physical devices.

   Please note that some entities classified as untrusted in the simple,
   general deployment scenario used most commonly in this document might
   be considered trusted in other deployments.  This document does not
   preclude such scenarios, but will keep the definitions and examples
   focused by only using the the simple, most general deployment
   scenario.

             Figure 1: Trusted and Untrusted Entities in PERC

3.1.  Untrusted Entities

   The architecture described in this framework document enables
   conferencing infrastructure to be hosted in domains, such as in a
   cloud conferencing provider's facilities, where the trustworthiness
   is below the level needed to assume the privacy of participant's
   media will not be compromised.  The conferencing infrastructure in
   such a domain is still trusted with reliably connecting the
   participants together in a conference, but not trusted with keying
   material needed to decrypt any of the participant's media.  Entities
   in such lower trustworthiness domains will simply be referred to as
   untrusted entities from this point forward.  This does not mean that
   they are completely untrusted as they may be trusted with most non-
   media related aspects of hosting a conference.

3.1.1.  MDD

   A Media Distribution Device (MDD) forwards RTP flows between
   endpoints in the conference while performing per-hop authentication
   of each RTP packet.  The MDD may need access to one or more RTP
   headers or header extensions, potentially adding or modifying a
   certain subset.  The MDD will also relay secured messaging between
   the endpoints and the key management function and will acquire per-
   hop key information from the KMF.  The actual media content MUST NOT
   not be decryptable by an MDD, so it is untrusted to have access to
   the E2E media encryption keys, which this framework's key exchange
   mechanisms will prevent.

   An endpoint's ability to join a conference hosted by an MDD MUST NOT
   alone be interpreted as being authorized to have access to the E2E



Jones & Benham          Expires November 14, 2016               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft           Private Media Framework                May 2016


   media encryption keys, as the MDD does not have the ability to
   determine whether an endpoint is authorized.

   An MDD MUST perform its role in properly forwarding media packets
   while taking measures to mitigate the adverse effects of denial of
   service attacks (refer to Section 6), etc, to a level equal to or
   better than traditional conferencing (i.e. pre-PERC) deployments.

   An MDD or associated conferencing infrastructure may also initiate or
   terminate various conference control related messaging, which is
   outside the scope of this framework document.

3.1.2.  Call Processing

   The call processing function is untrusted in the simple, general
   deployment scenario.  When a physical subset of the call processing
   function resides in facilities outside the trusted domain, it should
   not be trusted to have access to E2E key information.

   The call processing function may include the processing of call
   signaling messages, as well as the signing of those messages.  It may
   also authenticate the endpoints for the purpose of call signaling and
   subsequently joining of a conference hosted through one or more MDDs.
   Call processing may optionally ensure the privacy of call signaling
   messages between itself, the endpoint, and other entities.

   In any deployment scenario where the call processing function is
   considered trusted, the call processing function MUST ensure the
   integrity of received messages before forwarding to other entities.

3.2.  Trusted Entities

   From the PERC model system perspective, entities considered trusted
   (refer to Figure 1) can be in possession of the E2E media encryption
   key(s) for one or more conferences.

3.2.1.  Endpoint

   An endpoint is considered trusted and will have access to E2E key
   information.  While it is possible for an endpoint to be compromised,
   subsequently performing in undesired ways, defining endpoint
   resistance to compromise is outside the scope of this document.
   Endpoints will take measures to mitigate the adverse effects of
   denial of service attacks (refer to Section 6) from other entities,
   including from other endpoints, to a level equal to or better than
   traditional conference (i.e., pre-PERC) deployments.

Internet-Draft           Private Media Framework                May 2016


3.2.2.  KMF

   The KMF, which may be collocated with an endpoint or exist
   standalone, is responsible for providing key information to endpoints
   for both end-to-end and hop-by-hop security and for providing key
   information to MDDs for the hop-by-hop security.

   Interaction between the KMF and the call processing function may be
   necessary to for proper conference-to-endpoint mappings, which may or
   may not be satisfied by getting information directly from the
   endpoints or via some other means.  See Section 7 for a related item
   in the To Do list.

   The KMF needs to be secured and managed in a way to prevent
   exploitation by an adversary, as any kind of compromise of the KMF
   puts the security of the conference at risk.

4.  Framework for PERC

   The purpose for this framework is to define a means through which
   media privacy can be ensured when communicating within a conferencing
   environment consisting of one or more MDDs that only switch, hence
   not terminate, media.  It does not otherwise attempt to hide the fact
   that a conference between endpoints is taking place.

   This framework reuses several specified RTP security technologies,
   including SRTP [RFC3711], PERC EKT [I-D.ietf-perc-srtp-ekt-diet], and
   DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764].

4.1.  End-to-End and Hop-by-Hop Authenticated Encryption

   This solution framework focuses on the end-to-end privacy and
   integrity of the participant's media by limiting access to end-to-end
   key information to trusted entities.  However, this framework does
   give an MDD access to RTP headers and all or most header extensions,
   as well as the ability to modify a certain subset of those headers
   and to add header extensions.  Packets received by an MDD or an
   endpoint are authenticated hop-by-hop.

   To enable all of the above, this framework defines the use of two
   security contexts and two associated encryption keys; an "inner" key
   (E2E Key(i); i={a given endpoint}) for authenticated encryption of
   RTP media between endpoints and an "outer" key (HBH Key(j); j={a
   given hop}) for the hop between an endpoint and an MDD or between
   MDDs.  Reference the following figure.

            E2E and HBH Keys Used for Authenticated Encryption

   The PERC Double draft specification [I-D.ietf-perc-double] uses
   standard SRTP keying material and recommended cryptographic
   transform(s) to first form the inner, end-to-end SRTP cryptographic
   context.  That end-to-end SRTP cryptographic context MAY be used to
   encrypt some RTP header extensions along with RTP media content.  The
   output of this is treated like an RTP packet and encrypted again
   using the outer hop-by-hop cryptographic context.  The endpoint
   executes the entire Double operation while the MDD just performs the
   outer, hop-by-hop operation.

   RTCP can only be encrypted hop-by-hop, not end-to-end.  This
   framework introduces no additional step for RTCP authenticated
   encryption, so the procedures needed are specified in [RFC3711] and
   use the same outer, hop-by-hop cryptographic context chosen in the
   Double operation described above.

4.2.  E2E Key Confidentiality

   To ensure the confidentiality of E2E keys shared between endpoints,
   endpoints will make use of a common Key Encryption Key (KEK) that is
   known only by the trusted entities in a conference.  That KEK,
   defined in the PERC EKT [I-D.ietf-perc-srtp-ekt-diet] as the EKT Key,
   will be used to subsequently encrypt SRTP master keys used for E2E
   authenticated encryption (E2E Key(i); i={a given endpoint}) of media
   sent by a given endpoint.

     | Key     /    Entity | Endpoint A | MDD X | MDD Y | Endpoint B |

Internet-Draft           Private Media Framework                May 2016


4.3.  E2E Keys and Endpoint Operations

   Any given RTP media flow can be identified by its SSRC, and endpoints
   might send more than one at a time and change the mix of media flows
   transmitted during the life of a conference.

   Thus, endpoints MUST maintain a list of SSRCs from received RTP flows
   and each SSRC's associated E2E Key(i) information.  Following a
   change of the KEK (i.e., EKT Key), prior E2E Key(i) information
   SHOULD be retained for a period long enough to ensure that late-
   arriving or out-of-order packets from other endpoints can be
   successfully decrypted.  The endpoint MUST discard the E2E Key(i) and
   KEK information no later than when it leaves the conference.

   If there is a need to encrypt one or more RTP header extensions end-
   to-end, an encryption key is derived from the end-to-end SRTP master
   key to encrypt header extensions as per [RFC6904].  The MDD will not
   be able use the information contained in those header extensions
   encrypted with E2E keys.  See Section 7 for a related item in the To
   Do list.

4.4.  HBH Keys and Hop Operations

   To ensure the integrity of transmitted media packets, this framework
   requires that every packet be authenticated hop-by-hop (HBH) between
   an endpoint and an MDD, as well between MDDs.  The authentication key
   used for hop-by-hop authentication is derived from an SRTP master key
   shared only on the respective hop (HBH Key(j); j={a given hop}).
   Each HBH Key(j) is distinct per hop and no two hops ever
   intentionally use the same SRTP master key.

   Using hop-by-hop authentication gives the MDD the ability to change
   certain RTP header values.  Which values the MDD can change in the
   RTP header are defined in [I-D.ietf-perc-double].  RTCP can only be
   encrypted, giving the MDD the flexibility to forward RTCP content
   unchanged, transmit compound RTCP packets or to initiate RTCP packets
   for reporting statistics or conveying other information.  Performing
   hop-by-hop authentication for all RTP and RTCP packets also helps
   provide replay protection (see Section 6).

   If there is a need to encrypt one or more RTP header extensions hop-
   by-hop, an encryption key is derived from the hop-by-hop SRTP master
   key to encrypt header extensions as per [RFC6904].  This will still
   give the switching MDD visibility into header extensions, such as the
   one used to determine audio level [RFC6464] of conference
   participants.  Note that when RTP header extensions are encrypted,
   all hops - in the untrusted domain at least - will need to decrypt
   and re-encrypt these encrypted header extensions.

4.5.  Key Exchange

   To facilitate key exchange required to establish or generate an E2E
   key and a HBH key for an endpoint and the same HBH key for the MDD,
   this framework utilizes a DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] association between an
   endpoint and the KMF.  To establish this association, an endpoint
   will send DTLS-SRTP messages to the MDD which will then forward them
   to the MDD as defined in [I-D.jones-perc-dtls-tunnel].  The Key
   Encryption Key (KEK) (i.e., EKT Key) is also conveyed by the KMF over
   the DTLS association to endpoints via procedures defined in PERC EKT
   [I-D.ietf-perc-srtp-ekt-diet].

   MDDs use DTLS-SRTP [RFC5764] directly with a peer MDD to establish
   HBH keys for transmitting RTP and RTCP packets that peer MDD.  The
   KMF does not facilitate establishing HBH keys for use between MDDs.

4.5.1.  Initial Key Exchange and KMF

   The procedures defined in DTLS Tunnel for PERC
   [I-D.jones-perc-dtls-tunnel] establish one or more DTLS tunnels
   between the MDD and KMF, making it is possible for the MDD to
   facilitate the establishment of a secure DTLS association between
   each endpoint and the KMF as shown the following figure.  The DTLS
   association between endpoints and the KMF will enable each endpoint
   to receive E2E key information, Key Encryption Key (KEK) information
   (i.e., EKT Key), and HBH key information.  At the same time, the KMF
   can securely provide the HBH key information to the MDD.  The key
   information summarized here may include the SRTP master key, SRTP
   master salt, and the negotiated cryptographic transform.

   with the KMF.  The MDD will not terminate the DTLS signaling, but
   will instead forward DTLS packets received from an endpoint on to the
   KMF (and vice versa) via a tunnel established between MDD and the
   KMF.  This tunnel used to encapsulate the DTLS-SRTP signaling between
   the KMF and endpoints will also be used to convey HBH key information
   from the KMF to the MDD, so no additional protocol or interface is
   required.

4.5.2.  Key Exchange during a Conference

   Following the initial key information exchange with the KMF,
   endpoints will be able to encrypt media end-to-end with their E2E
   Key(i), sending that E2E Key(i) to other endpoints encrypted with
   KEK, and will be able to encrypt and authenticate RTP packets using
   local HBH Key(j).  The procedures defined do not allow the MDD to
   gain access to the KEK information, preventing it from gaining access
   to any endpoint's E2E key and subsequently decrypting media.

   The KEK (i.e., EKT Key) may need to change from time-to-time during
   the life of a conference, such as when a new participant joins or
   leaves a conference.  Dictating if, when or how often a conference is
   to be re-keyed is outside the scope of this document, but this
   framework does accommodate re-keying during the life of a conference.

   When a KMF decides to rekey a conference, it transmits a specific
   message defined in PERC EKT [I-D.ietf-perc-srtp-ekt-diet] to each of
   the conference participants.  The endpoint MUST create a new SRTP
   master key and prepare to send that key inside a Full EKT Field using
   the new EKT Key. Since it may take some time for all of the endpoints
   in conference to finish re-keying, senders MUST delay a short period
   of time before sending media encrypted with the new master key, but
   it MUST be prepared to make use of the information from a new inbound
   EKT Key immediately.  See Section 2.2.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-perc-srtp-ekt-diet].

5.  Entity Trust

   It is important to this solution framework that the entities can
   trust and validate the authenticity of other entities, especially the
   KMF and endpoints.  The details of this are outside the scope of
   specification but a few possibilities are discussed in the following
   sections.  The key requirements is that endpoints can verify they are
   connected to the correct KMF for the conference and the KMF can
   verify the endpoints are the correct endpoints for the conference.

   Two possible approaches to solve this are Identity Assertions and
   Certificate Fingerprints.

5.1.  Identity Assertions

   WebRTC Identity assertion (EDITOR NOTE: add I-D reference) can be
   used to bind the identity of the user of the endpoint to the
   fingerprint of the DTLS-SRTP certificate used for the call.  This
   certificate is unique for a given call and a conference.  This allows
   the KMF to ensure that only authorized users participate in the
   conference.  Similarly the KMF can create a WeBRTC Identity assertion
   bound the fingerprint of the unique certificate used by the KMF for
   this conference so that the endpoint can validate it is talking to
   the correct KMF.

5.2.  Certificate Fingerprints in Session Signaling

   Entities managing session signaling are generally assumed to be
   untrusted in the PERC framework.  However, there are some deployment
   scenarios where parts of the session signaling may be assumed
   trustworthy for the purposes of exchanging, in a manner that can be
   authenticated, the fingerprint of an entity's certificate.

   As a concrete example, SIP [RFC3261] and SDP [RFC4566] can be used to
   convey the fingerprint information per [RFC5763].  An endpoint's SIP
   User Agent would send an INVITE message containing SDP for the media
   session along with the endpoint's certificate fingerprint, which can
   be signed using the procedures described in [RFC4474] for the benefit
   of forwarding the message to other entities.  Other entities can now
   verify the fingerprints match the certificates found in the DTLS-SRTP
   connections to find the identity of the far end of the DTLS-SRTP
   connection and check that is the authorized entity.

   Ultimately, if using session signaling, an endpoint's certificate
   fingerprint would need to be securely mapped to a user and conveyed
   to the KMF so that it can check that that user is authorized.
   Similarly, the KMF's certificate fingerprint can be conveyed to
   endpoint in a manner that can be authenticated as being an authorized
   KMF for this conference.

6.  Attacks on Privacy Enhanced RTP Conferencing

   This framework, and the individual protocols defined to support it,
   must take care to not increase the exposure to Denial of Service
   (DoS) attacks by untrusted or third-party entities and should take
   measures to mitigate, where possible, more serious DoS attacks from
   on-path and off-path attackers.

   The following section enumerates the kind of attacks that will be
   considered in the development of this framework's solution.

Internet-Draft           Private Media Framework                May 2016


6.1.  Third Party Attacks

   On-path attacks are mitigated by HBH integrity protection and
   encryption.  The integrity protection mitigates packet modification
   and encryption makes selective blocking of packets harder, but not
   impossible.

   Off-path attackers may try connecting to different PERC entities and
   send specifically crafted packets.  A successful attacker might be
   able to get the MDD to forward such packets.  If not making use of
   HBH authentication on the MDD, such an attack could only be detected
   in the receiving endpoints where the forged packets would finally be
   dropped.

   Another potential attack is a third party claiming to be an MDD,
   fooling endpoints in to sending packets to the false MDD instead of
   the correct one.  The deceived sending endpoints could incorrectly
   assuming their packets have been delivered to endpoints when they in
   fact have not.  Further, the false MDD may cascade to another
   legitimate MDD creating a false version of the real conference.

   This attack can be mitigated by the false MDD not being authenticated
   by the KMF during PERC Tunnel establishment.  Without the tunnel in
   place, endpoints will not establish secure associations with the KMF
   and receive the KEK, causing the conference to not proceed.

6.2.  MDD Attacks

   The MDD can attack the session in a number of possible ways.

6.2.1.  Denial of service

   Any modification of the end-to-end authenticated data will result in
   the receiving endpoint getting an integrity failure when performing
   authentication on the received packet.

   The MDD can also attempt to perform resource consumption attacks on
   the receiving endpoint.  One such attack would be to insert random
   SSRC/CSRC values in any RTP packet with an inband key-distribution
   message attached (i.e., Full EKT Field).  Since such a message would
   trigger the receiver to form a new cryptographic context, the MDD can
   attempt to consume the receiving endpoints resources.

   Another denial of service attack is where the MDD rewrites the PT
   field to indicate a different codec.  The effect of this attack is
   that any payload packetized and encoded according to one RTP payload
   format is then processed using another payload format and codec.
   Assuming that the implementation is robust to random input, it is



Jones & Benham          Expires November 14, 2016              [Page 13]

Internet-Draft           Private Media Framework                May 2016


   unlikely to cause crashes in the receiving software/hardware.
   However, it is not unlikely that such rewriting will cause severe
   media degradation.

   For audio formats, this attack is likely to cause highly disturbing
   audio and/or can be damaging to hearing and playout equipment.

6.2.2.  Replay Attack

   Replay attack is when an already received packets from a previous
   point in the RTP stream is replayed as new packet.  This could, for
   example, allow an MDD to transmit a sequence of packets identified as
   a user saying "yes", instead of the "no" the user actually said.

   The mitigation for a replay attack is to prevent old packets beyond a
   small-to-modest jitter and network re-ordering sized window to be
   rejected.  End-to-end replay protection MUST be provided for the
   whole duration of the conference.

6.2.3.  Delayed Playout Attack

   The delayed playout attack is a variant of the replay attack.  This
   attack is possible even if E2E replay protection is in place.
   However, due to fact that the MDD is allowed to select a sub-set of
   streams and not forward the rest to a receiver, such as in forwarding
   only the most active speakers, the receiver has to accept gaps in the
   E2E packet sequence.  The issue with this is that an MDD can select
   to not deliver a particular stream for a while.

   Within the window from last packet forwarded to the receiver and the
   latest received by the MDD, the MDD can select an arbitrary starting
   point when resuming forwarding packets.  Thus what the media source
   said can be substantially delayed at the receiver with the receiver
   believing that it is what was said just now, and only delayed due to
   transport delay.

6.2.4.  Splicing Attack

   The splicing attack is an attack where an MDD receiving multiple
   media sources splices one media stream into the other.  If the MDD is
   able to change the SSRC without the receiver having any method for
   verifying the original source ID, then the MDD could first deliver
   stream A and then later forward stream B under the same SSRC as
   stream A was previously using.  Not allowing the MDD to change the
   SSRC mitigates this attack.

7.  To-Do List

   o  The mapping of endpoints-to-conference identifiers may need to be
      conveyed in the framework.  Need Revisit this text after a design
      choice is made between alternatives.

   o  Consider adding a list of RTP header extensions that should/must
      not be E2E encrypted.

   o  Endpoints, KMF and MDD provider must securely convey their
      respective certificate information directly or indirectly via some
      means, such as via an identity service provider.

   o  If as in "Double" draft, the ROC value is no longer in the clear
      and associated with the "outer" protection scheme, we may need to
      require that the MDD maintain a separate ROC value for each SSRC
      sent to each endpoint.  This ROC value should start at 0
      regardless of the sequence number in that first packet sent to an
      endpoint.

   o  Investigate adding ability to enable the transmission of one-way
      media from a non-trusted device (e.g., announcements).  One
      possible solution is to have the KMF send an "ekt_key" message
      that is explicitly labeled for receive-only and giving that to
      announcement servers.  A possible approach would be to define EKT
      Keys with a SPI > 32000, for example, for this purpose and
      endpoints should only use those EKT Keys to decrypt Full EKT
      Fields received from such transmitters.  Endpoints would never
      send media with EKT Keys with those SPI values.
