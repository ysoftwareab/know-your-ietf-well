     Reference Interaction Models for Remote Attestation Procedures
            draft-ietf-rats-reference-interaction-models-00

Abstract

   This document describes interaction models for remote attestation
   procedures (RATS).  Three conveying mechanisms - Challenge/Response,
   Uni-Directional, and Streaming Remote Attestation - are illustrated
   and defined.  Analogously, a general overview about the information
   elements typically used by corresponding conveyance protocols are
   highlighted.  Privacy preserving conveyance of Evidence via Direct
   Anonymous Attestation is elaborated on for each interaction model,
   individually.

1.  Introduction

   Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS, [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture])
   are workflows composed of roles and interactions, in which Verifiers
   create Attestation Results about the trustworthiness of an Attester's
   system component characteristics.  The Verifier's assessment in the
   form of Attestation Results is created based on Attestation Policies
   and Evidence - trustable and tamper-evident Claims Sets about an
   Attester's system component characteristics - created by an Attester.
   The roles _Attester_ and _Verifier_, as well as the Conceptual
   Messages _Evidence_ and _Attestation Results_ are terms defined by
   the RATS Architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  This documents
   captures interaction models that can be used in specific RATS-related
   solution documents.  The primary focus of this document is the
   conveyance of attestation Evidence.  Specific goals of this document
   are to:

   o  prevent inconsistencies in descriptions of these interaction
      models in other documents (due to text cloning over time),

   o  enable to highlight an exact delta/divergence between the core set
      of characteristics captured here in this document and variants of
      these interaction models used in other specifications or
      solutions, and to

   o  illustrate the application of Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA)
      for each of the interaction models described.

   In summary, this document enables the specification and design of
   trustworthy and privacy preserving conveyance methods for attestation
   Evidence from an Attester to a Verifier.  While the conveyance of
   other Conceptual Messages is out-of-scope the methods described can
   also be applied to the conveyance of Endorsements or Attestation
   Results.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms, roles, and concepts defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]:

   Attester, Verifier, Relying Party, Conceptual Message, Evidence,
   Endorsement, Attestation Result, Appraisal Policy, Attesting
   Environment, Target Environment

   A PKIX Certificate is an X.509v3 format certificate as specified by
   [RFC5280].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Disambiguation

   The term "Remote Attestation" is a common expression and often
   associated or connoted with certain properties.  The term "Remote" in
   this context does not necessarily refer to a remote entity in the
   scope of network topologies or the Internet.  It rather refers to a
   decoupled system or entities that exchange the payload of the
   Conceptual Message type called Evidence [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].
   This conveyance can also be "local", if the Verifier is part of the
   same entity as the Attester, e.g., separate system components of a
   Composite Device (a single RATS Entity).  Examples of these types of
   co-located environments include: a Trusted Execution Environment
   (TEE), Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs), as well as other
   physical or logical protected/isolated/shielded Computing
   Environments (e.g. embedded Secure Elements (eSE) or Trusted Platform
   Modules (TPM)).

4.  Scope and Intent

   This document focuses on generic interaction models between Attesters
   and Verifiers in order to convey Evidence.  Complementary procedures,
   functions, or services that are required for a complete semantic
   binding of the concepts defined in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] are
   out-of-scope of this document.  Examples include: identity
   establishment, key distribution and enrollment, time synchronization,
   as well as certificate revocation.

   Furthermore, any processes and duties that go beyond carrying out
   remote attestation procedures are out-of-scope.  For instance, using
   the results of a remote attestation that are created by the Verifier,
   e.g., how to triggering remediation actions or recovery processes, as
   well as such remediation actions and recovery processes themselves,
   are also out-of-scope.

   The interaction models illustrated in this document are intended to
   provide a stable basis and reference for other solutions documents
   inside or outside the IETF.  Solution documents of any kind can
   reference the interaction models in order to avoid text clones and to
   avoid the danger of subtle discrepancies.  Analogously, deviations
   from the generic model descriptions in this document can be
   illustrated in solutions documents to highlight distinct
   contributions.

5.  Direct Anonymous Attestation

   DAA [DAA] is a signature scheme used in RATS that allows preservation
   of the privacy of users that are associated with an Attester (e.g.
   its owner).  Essentially, DAA can be seen as a group signature scheme
   with the feature that given a DAA signature no-one can find out who
   the signer is, i.e., the anonymity is not revocable.  To be able to
   sign anonymously an Attester has to obtain a credential from a DAA
   Issuer.  The DAA Issuer uses a private/public key pair to generate a
   credential for an Attester and makes the public key (in the form of a
   public key certificate) available to the verifier to enable them to
   validate the DAA signature obtained as part of the Evidence.

   In order to support these DAA signatures, the DAA Issuer MUST
   associate a single key pair with each group of Attesters and use the
   same key pair when creating the credentials for all of the Attesters
   in this group.  The DAA Issuer's public key certificate for the group
   replaces the Attester Identity documents in the verification of the
   Evidence (instead of unique Attester Identity documents).  This is in
   contrast to intuition that there has to be a unique Attester Identity
   per device.

   This document extends the duties of the Endorser role as defined by
   the RATS architecture with respect to the provision of these Attester
   Identity documents to Attesters.  The existing duties of the Endorser
   role and the duties of a DAA Issuer are quite similar as illustrated
   in the following subsections.

5.1.  Endorsers

   Via its Attesting Environments, an Attester can only create Evidence
   about its Target Environments.  After being appraised to be
   trustworthy, a Target Environment may become a new Attesting
   Environment in charge of creating Evidence for further Target
   Environments.  [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] explains this as Layered
   Attestation.  Layered Attestation has to start with an initial
   Attesting Environment (i.e., there cannot be turtles all the way down
   [turtles]).  At this rock bottom of Layered Attestation, the
   Attesting Environments are called Roots of Trust (RoT).  An Attester
   cannot create Evidence about its own RoTs by design.  As a
   consequence, a Verifier requires trustable statements about this
   subset of Attesting Environments from a different source than the
   Attester itself.  The corresponding trustable statements are called
   Endorsements and originate from external, trustable entities that
   take on the role of an Endorser (e.g., supply chain entities).

5.2.  Endorsers for Direct Anonymous Attestation

   In order to enable DAA to be used, an Endorser role takes on the
   duties of a DAA Issuer in addition to its already defined duties.
   DAA Issuers offer zero-knowledge proofs based on public key
   certificates used for a group of Attesters [DAA].  Effectively, these
   certificates share the semantics of Endorsements.  The differences
   are:

   o  The associated private keys are used by the DAA Issuer to provide
      an Attester with a credential that it can use to convince the
      Verifier that its Evidence is valid.  To keep their anonymity the
      Attester randomises this credential each time that it is used.

   o  The Verifier can use the DAA Issuer's public key certificate,
      together with the randomised credential from the Attester, to
      confirm that the Evidence comes from a valid Attester.

   o  A credential is conveyed from an Endorser to an Attester together
      with the transfer of the public key certificates from Endorser to
      Verifier.

   The zero-knowledge proofs required cannot be created by an Attester
   alone - like the Endorsements of RoTs - and have to be created by a
   trustable third entity - like an Endorser.  Due to that vast semantic
   overlap (XXX-mcr:explain), an Endorser in this document can convey
   trustable third party statements both to a Verifier and an Attester.

6.  Normative Prerequisites

   In order to ensure an appropriate conveyance of Evidence, the
   following set of prerequisites MUST be in place to support the
   implementation of interaction models:

   Attester Identity:  The provenance of Evidence with respect to a
      distinguishable Attesting Environment MUST be correct and
      unambiguous.

      An Attester Identity MAY be a unique identity, it MAY be included
      in a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), or it MAY be part of a group
      signature, or it MAY be a randomised DAA credential.

   Attestation Evidence Authenticity:  Attestation Evidence MUST be
      correct and authentic.

      In order to provide proofs of authenticity, Attestation Evidence
      SHOULD be cryptographically associated with an identity document
      (e.g. an PKIX certificate or trusted key material, or a randomised



Birkholz, et al.         Expires March 13, 2021                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                    REIM                    September 2020


      DAA credential), or SHOULD include a correct and unambiguous and
      stable reference to an accessible identity document.

   Authentication Secret:  An Authentication Secret MUST be available
      exclusively to an Attester's Attesting Environment.

      The Attester MUST protect Claims with that Authentication Secret,
      thereby proving the authenticity of the Claims included in
      Evidence.  The Authentication Secret MUST be established before
      RATS can take place.

   Evidence Freshness:  Evidence MUST include an indicator about its
      Freshness that can be understood by a Verifier.  Analogously,
      interaction models MUST support the conveyance of proofs of
      freshness in a way that is useful to Verifiers and their appraisal
      procedures.

   Evidence Protection:  Evidence MUST be a set of well-formatted and
      well-protected Claims that an Attester can create and convey to a
      Verifier in a tamper-evident manner.

7.  Generic Information Elements

   This section defines the information elements that are vital to all
   kinds interaction models.  Varying from solution to solution, generic
   information elements can be either included in the scope of protocol
   messages or can be included in their payload.  Ultimately, the
   following information elements are required by any kind of scalable
   remote attestation procedure using one or more of the interaction
   models provided.

   Attester Identity ('attesterIdentity'):  _mandatory_

      A statement about a distinguishable Attester made by an Endorser
      without accompanying evidence about its validity - used as proof
      of identity.

      In DAA the Attester's identity is not revealed to the verifier.
      The Attester is issued with a credential by the Endorser that is
      randomised and then used to anonymously confirm the validity of
      their evidence.  The evidence is verified using the Endorser's
      public key.

   Authentication Secret IDs ('authSecID'):  _mandatory_

      A statement representing an identifier list that MUST be
      associated with corresponding Authentication Secrets used to
      protect Evidence.  In DAA, Authentication Secret IDs are



Birkholz, et al.         Expires March 13, 2021                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                    REIM                    September 2020


      represented by the Endorser (DAA issuer)'s public key that MUST be
      used to create DAA credentials for the corresponding
      Authentication Secrets used to protect Evidence.

      Each Authentication Secret is uniquely associated with a
      distinguishable Attesting Environment.  Consequently, an
      Authentication Secret ID also identifies an Attesting Environment.
      In DAA an Authentication Secret ID does not identify a unique
      Attesting Environment but associated with a group of Attesting
      Environments.  This is because an Attesting Environment should not
      be distinguishable and the DAA credential which represents the
      Attesting Environment is randomised each time it used.

   Handle ('handle'):  _mandatory_

      A statement that is intended to uniquely distinguish received
      Evidence and/or determine the Freshness of Evidence.

      A Verifier can also use a Handle as an indicator for authenticity
      or attestation provenance, as only Attesters and Verifiers that
      are intended to exchange Evidence should have knowledge of the
      corresponding Handles.  Examples include Nonces or signed
      timestamps.

   Claims ('claims'):  _mandatory_

      Claims are assertions that represent characteristics of an
      Attester's Target Environment.

      Claims are part Conceptual Message and are, for example, used to
      appraise the integrity of Attesters via a Verifiers.  The other
      information elements in this section can be expressed as Claims in
      any type of Conceptional Messages.

   Reference Claims ('refClaims')  _mandatory_

      Reference Claims are a specific subset of Appraisal Policies as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].

      Reference Claims are used to appraise the Claims received from an
      Attester via appraisal by direct comparison.  For example,
      Reference Claims MAY be Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM) or
      assertions that are implicitly trusted because they are signed by
      a trusted authority (see Endorsements in
      [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]).  Reference Claims typically
      represent (trusted) Claim sets about an Attester's intended
      platform operational state.

Internet-Draft                    REIM                    September 2020


   Claim Selection ('claimSelection'):  _optional_

      A statement that represents a (sub-)set of Claims that can be
      created by an Attester.

      Claim Selections can act as filters that can specify the exact set
      of Claims to be included in Evidence.  An Attester MAY decide
      whether or not to provide all Claims as requested via a Claim
      Selection.

   Evidence ('signedAttestationEvidence'):  _mandatory_

      A set of Claims that consists of a list of Authentication Secret
      IDs that each identifies an Authentication Secret in a single
      Attesting Environment, the Attester Identity, Claims, and a
      Handle.  Attestation Evidence MUST cryptographically bind all of
      these information elements.  The Evidence MUST be protected via
      the Authentication Secret.  The Authentication Secret MUST be
      trusted by the Verifier as authoritative.

   Attestation Result ('attestationResult'):  _mandatory_

      An Attestation Result is produced by the Verifier as the output of
      the appraisal of Evidence.  Attestation Results include condensed
      assertions about integrity or other characteristics of the
      corresponding Attester.

8.  Interaction Models

   The following subsections introduce and illustrate the interaction
   models:

   1.  Challenge/Response Remote Attestation

   2.  Uni-Directional Remote Attestation

   3.  Streaming Remote Attestation

   Each section starts with a sequence diagram illustrating the
   interactions between Attester and Verifier.  The other roles RATS
   roles - mainly Relying Parties and Endorsers - are not relevant for
   this interaction model.  While the interaction models presented focus
   on the conveyance of Evidence, future work could apply this to the
   conveyance of other Conceptual Messages, namely Attestation Results,
   Endorsements, or Appraisal Policies.

   All interaction model have a strong focus on the use of a handle to
   incorporate a proof of freshness.  The ways these handles are

   interaction models.

   This Challenge/Response Remote Attestation procedure is initiated by
   the Verifier, by sending a remote attestation request to the
   Attester.  A request includes a Handle, a list of Authentication
   Secret IDs, and a Claim Selection.

   In the Challenge/Response model, the handle is composed of qualifying
   data in the form of a cryptographically strongly randomly generated,
   and therefore unpredictable, nonce.  The Verifier-generated nonce is
   intended to guarantee Evidence freshness.

   The list of Authentication Secret IDs selects the attestation keys
   with which the Attester is requested to sign the Attestation
   Evidence.  Each selected key is uniquely associated with an Attesting
   Environment of the Attester.  As a result, a single Authentication
   Secret ID identifies a single Attesting Environment.

   Analogously, a particular set of Evidence originating from a
   particular Attesting Environments in a composite device can be
   requested via multiple Authentication Secret IDs.  Methods to acquire

   Authentication Secret IDs or mappings between Attesting Environments
   to Authentication Secret IDs are out-of-scope of this document.

   The Claim Selection narrows down the set of Claims collected and used
   to create Evidence to those that the Verifier requires.  If the Claim
   Selection is omitted, then by default all Claims that are known and
   available on the Attester MUST be used to create corresponding
   Evidence.  For example when performing a boot integrity evaluation, a
   Verifier may only be requesting a particular subset of claims about
   the Attester, such as Evidence about BIOS and firmware the Attester
   booted up, and not include information about all currently running
   software.

   While it is crucial that Claims, the Handle, as well as the Attester
   Identity information MUST be cryptographically bound to the signature
   of Evidence, they may be presented in an encrypted form.

   Cryptographic blinding MAY be used at this point.  For further
   reference see section Section 11.

   As soon as the Verifier receives signed Evidence, it validates the
   signature, the Attester Identity, as well as the Nonce, and appraises
   the Claims.  Appraisal procedures are application-specific and can be
   conducted via comparison of the Claims with corresponding Reference
   Claims, such as Reference Integrity Measurements.  The final output
   of the Verifier are Attestation Results.  Attestation Results
   constitute new Claims Sets about an Attester's properties and
   characteristics that enables Relying Parties, for example, to assess
   an Attester's trustworthiness.

   Uni-Directional Remote Attestation procedures can be initiated both
   by the Attester and by the Verifier.  Initiation by the Attester can
   result in unsolicited pushes of Evidence to the Verifier.  Initiation
   by the Verifier always results in solicited pushes to the Verifier.
   The Uni-Directional model uses the same information elements as the
   Challenge/Response model.  In the sequence diagram above, the
   Attester initiates the conveyance of Evidence (comparable with a
   RESTful POST operation or the emission of a beacon).  While a request
   of evidence from the Verifier would result in a sequence diagram more
   similar to the Challenge/Response model (comparable with a RESTful

   GET operation), the specific manner how handles are created and used
   always remains as the distinguishing quality of this model.  In the
   Uni-Directional model, handles are composed of trustable signed
   timestamps as shown in [I-D.birkholz-rats-tuda], potentially
   including other qualifying data.  The handles are created by an
   external 3rd entity - the Handle Distributor - that includes a
   trustworthy source of time and takes on the role of a Time Stamping
   Authority (TSA, as initially defined in [RFC3161]).  Timstamps
   created from local clocks (absolute clocks using a global timescale,
   as well as relative clocks, such as tick-counters) of Attesters and
   Verifiers MUST be cryptographically bound to fresh Handles received
   from the Handle Distributor.  This binding provides a proof of
   synchronization that MUST be included in every evidence created.
   Correspondingly, evidence created for conveyance via this model
   provides a proof that it was fresh at a certain point in time.
   Effectively, this allows for series of evidence to be pushed to
   multiple Verifiers, simultaniously.  Methods to detect excessive time
   drift that would mandate a fresh Handle to be received by the Handle
   Distributor, as well as timing of handle distribution are out-of-
   scope of this document.

   Streaming Remote Attestation procedures require the setup of
   subscription state.  Setting up subscription state between a Verifier
   and an Attester is conducted via a subscribe operation.  This
   subscribe operation is used to convey the handles required for
   Evidence generation.  Effectively, this allows for series of evidence
   to be pushed to a Verifier similar to the Uni-Directional model.
   While a Handle Distributor is not required in this model, it is also
   limited to bi-lateral subscription relationships, in which each
   Verifier has to create and provide its individual handle.  Handles
   provided by a specific subscribing Verifier MUST be used in Evidence
   generation for that specific Verifier.  The Streaming model uses the
   same information elements as the Challenge/Response and the Uni-
   Directional model.  Methods to detect excessive time drift that would
   mandate a refreshed Handle to be conveyed via another subscribe
   operation are out-of-scope of this document.

9.  Additional Application-Specific Requirements

   Depending on the use cases covered, there can be additional
   requirements.  An exemplary subset is illustrated in this section.

9.1.  Confidentiality

   Confidentiality of exchanged attestation information may be
   desirable.  This requirement usually is present when communication
   takes place over insecure channels, such as the public Internet.  In
   such cases, TLS may be uses as a suitable communication protocol that
   preserves confidentiality.  In private networks, such as carrier
   management networks, it must be evaluated whether or not the
   transport medium is considered confidential.

9.2.  Mutual Authentication

   In particular use cases mutual authentication may be desirable in
   such a way that a Verifier also needs to prove its identity to the
   Attester, instead of only the Attester proving its identity to the
   Verifier.

9.3.  Hardware-Enforcement/Support

   Depending on given usage scenarios, hardware support for secure
   storage of cryptographic keys, crypto accelerators, as well as
   protected or isolated execution environments can be mandatory
   requirements.  Well-known technologies in support of these
   requirements are roots of trusts, such as Hardware Security Modules
   (HSM), Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Shielded Secrets, or
   Trusted Executions Environments (TEEs).

10.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section as well as references
   to [BCP205] before AUTH48.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [BCP205].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their

   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [BCP205], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

10.1.  Implementer

   The open-source implementation was initiated and is maintained by the
   Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology - SIT.

10.2.  Implementation Name

   The open-source implementation is named "CHAllenge-Response based
   Remote Attestation" or in short: CHARRA.

10.3.  Implementation URL

10.5.  Coverage and Version Compatibility

   The current version (commit '847bcde') is aligned with the exemplary
   specification of the CoAP FETCH bodies defined in section Appendix A
   of this document.

10.6.  License

   The CHARRA project and all corresponding code and data maintained on
   github are provided under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised"
   license.

10.7.  Implementation Dependencies

11.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   In a remote attestation procedure the Verifier or the Attester MAY
   want to cryptographically blind several attributes.  For instance,
   information can be part of the signature after applying a one-way
   function (e. g. a hash function).

   There is also a possibility to scramble the Nonce or Attester
   Identity with other information that is known to both the Verifier
   and Attester.  A prominent example is the IP address of the Attester
   that usually is known by the Attester itself as well as the Verifier.
   This extra information can be used to scramble the Nonce in order to
   counter certain types of relay attacks.

Appendix A.  CDDL Specification for a simple CoAP Challenge/Response
             Interaction

   The following CDDL specification is an exemplary proof-of-concept to
   illustrate a potential implementation of the Challenge/Response
   Interaction Model.  The transfer protocol used is CoAP using the
   FETCH operation.  The actual resource operated on can be empty.  Both
   the Challenge Message and the Response Message are exchanged via the
   FETCH operation and corresponding FETCH Request and FETCH Response
   body.
