Internet Draft     SNANAU APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB     September 1998


This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it defines objects for monitoring and controlling HPR (High
Performance Routing) network devices which have the capability to
communicate in IP (Internet Protocol) networks. This memo identifies
managed objects for the HPR in IP network communications.

1.  Introduction

This document is a product of the SNA NAU Services MIB Working Group.
It defines a MIB module for managing devices with HPR in IP networks
capabilities.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [17].


This memo does not specify a standard for the Internet community.

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

o    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [1].

o    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
     purpose of management. The first version of this Structure of
     Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in RFC
     1155 [2], RFC 1212 [3] and RFC 1215 [4]. The second version, called
     SMIv2, is described in RFC 1902 [5], RFC 1903 [6] and RFC 1904 [7].

o    Message protocols for transferring management information. The
     first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
     described in RFC 1157 [8]. A second version of the SNMP message
     protocol, which is not an Internet standards track protocol, is
     called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [9] and RFC 1906 [10]. The
     third version of the message protocol is called SNMPv3 and
     described in RFC 1906 [10], RFC 2272 [11] and RFC 2274 [12].

o    Protocol operations for accessing management information. The first
     set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described
     in RFC 1157 [8]. A second set of protocol operations and associated
     PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 [13].

o    A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273 [14] and
     the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2275 [15].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2. A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


3.  Overview

This document identifies a set of objects for monitoring the
configuration and active characteristics of devices with HPR in IP
network capabilities.  HPR is an enhancement to the Advanced Peer-to-
Peer Network (APPN) architecture that provides fast data routing and
improved session reliability.  APPN is the aspect of Systems Network
Architecture (SNA) that supports peer-to-peer networking. APPN/HPR in IP
Networks is a further enhancement to the APPN/HPR architecture,
described in RFC 2353 [18].  It provides a method with which APPN/HPR
nodes can communicate in IP networks.

APPN management information is defined by the APPN MIB [19].  HPR
management information is defined by the HPR MIB, RFC 2238 [20].

Highlights of the management functions supported by the APPN/HPR in IP
Networks MIB module include the following:


o    A count of UDP packets sent with each type of APPN traffic on
     HPR/IP links.

o    Monitoring and setting configuration parameters for the mappings
     between APPN traffic types on Type of Service (TOS) Precedence
     settings in the IP header.


This MIB module does not support:

Internet Draft     SNANAU APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB     September 1998


o    Configuration of IP addresses used for APPN ports or link stations.


3.1.  HPR/IP Values for Objects in the APPN MIB

Ports and link stations are the APPN device's interface to the data link
control (DLC), which provides the physical transport, or to another
protocol, such as IP.  The APPN MIB identifies ports and link stations
using IP as the transport with the following objects:


o    appnPortDlcType

o    appnLsDlcType

o    appnLsStatusDlcType


These objects all have the syntax IANAifType, and the value 126, defined
as "IP (for APPN HPR in IP networks)" shall be returned when they
identify an HPR/IP port or link station.

The IP address used for the port or link station is returned in the
following objects:


o    appnPortDlcLocalAddr

o    appnLsLocalAddr

o    appnLsRemoteAddr

o    appnLsStatusLocalAddr

o    appnLsStatusRemoteAddr


These objects have the syntax DisplayableDlcAddress, defined in the APPN
MIB as a textual convention to represent the address as an octet string
of ASCII characters.

The following two objects return object identifiers that tie port and
link table entries in the APPN MIB to lower-layer MIB entries:


o    appnPortSpecific

Internet Draft     SNANAU APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB     September 1998


o    appnLsSpecific


Both objects should return a RowPointer to the ifEntry in the agent's
ifTable for the physical interface associated with the local IP address
for the port.  If the agent implements the IP-MIB (RFC 2011), this
association between the IP address and the physical interface will be
represented in the ipNetToMediaTable.


3.2.  APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB Structure

The APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB module contains two groups of objects:


o    hprIpMonitoringGroup - an object for counting outgoing HPR/IP
     traffic for each APPN traffic type

o    hprIpConfigurationGroup - objects to represent TOS Precedence to
     APPN traffic type mappings


These groups are described below in more detail.


3.2.1.  hprIpMonitoringGroup

The hprIpMonitoringGroup group consists of the hprIpActiveLsTable.  This
table is indexed by the link station name and traffic type, and contains
a counter for the number of UDP packets sent on a link station for that
traffic type.


3.2.2.  hprIpConfigurationGroup

The hprIpMonitoringGroup group consists of the following objects and
tables:

1) hprIpAppnPortTable

This table supports reading and setting the default mapping between APPN
traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for all link stations using a
port.  This mapping may be overridden for individual link stations or
individual connection networks.

2) hprIpLsTable

Internet Draft     SNANAU APPN/HPR in IP Networks MIB     September 1998


This table supports reading and setting the mappings between APPN
traffic types and TOS Precedence settings for an individual link station
and APPN traffic type.  If there is no entry in this table for a given
link station and traffic type, then that link station inherits its
mapping from its port.

3) hprIpCnTable

This table supports reading and setting the mapping between APPN traffic
types and TOS Precedence settings for an individual connection network
and traffic type.  If there is no entry in this table for a given
connection network and traffic type, then that connection network
inherits its mapping from its port.

5.  Security Considerations

Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information
SHOULD be employed in such environments.  An authentication protocol is
defined in [12].  A protocol for access control is defined in [15].  It
is a customer responsibility to properly set up access control for MIB
access.

None of the read-only objects in this MIB reports a password, user data,
or anything else that is particularly sensitive.  Some enterprises view
their network configuration itself, as well as information about network
usage and performance, as corporate assets; such enterprises may wish to
restrict SNMP access to most of the objects in the MIB.

The one read-write and four read-create objects in the MIB can affect
network operations; it is recommended that SNMP access to these objects
be restricted.  The five objects are:

o    hprIpPortTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object immediately changes
     the mapping for all link stations using this port which do not have
     an entry to override the port value.  Improper mappings may cause
     delays or disruptions in the network.  For example, if APPN traffic
     type 'High' is mapped to IP TOS Precedence bits '001', network
     control traffic will have the same TOS precedence as bulk data
     traffic.  This may cause delays with session initializations, and
     timeouts on control sessions that could cause network outages.

o    hprIpLsTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object has the potential for
     delay or disruption for this link station as described above with
     hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.

o    hprIpLsRowStatus:  Setting this object to delete(6) causes this
     link station to revert to the default TOS Precedence mapping for
     its port.  The customized mapping for this link station will no
     longer be in effect.

o    hprIpCnTOSPrecedence:  Setting this object has the potential for
     delay or disruption for this links created for this connection
     network as described above with hprIpPortTOSPrecedence.

o    hprIpCnRowStatus:  Setting this object to delete(6) causes links
     created for this connection network to revert to the default TOS
     Precedence mapping for its port.  The customized mapping for this
     connection network will no longer be in effect.
