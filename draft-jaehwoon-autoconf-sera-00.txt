Internet-Draft     Scope-Extended Router Advertisement     July 5, 2008


Abstract 

   In the connected MANET, the MANET Border Router (MBR) is used to
   connect the MANET with the external network and MANET nodes are 
   required to know the MBR address to communicate with hosts in the 
   external network. One way of acquiring the MBR address is to use the 
   Router Advertisement (RA) and the Router Solicitation (RS) messages.
   In order to allow RA/RS messages to be delivered in the multi-hop
   MANET, the modified RA/RS message has been defined [5]. However, 
   this approach may incur the duplicate packet reception problem due 
   to rebroadcasting of received RA/RS messages to its neighbors.
   In this draft, we define the scope-extended Router Advertisement/
   Solicitation message for announcing/solicitating the MBR address in
   the connected MANET. In the scope-extended RA/RS message, a new 
   message field, the sequence number field, is defined so that 
   duplicate RA/RS messages can be detected based on the sequence 
   number and the IP address included in the message.

Internet-Draft     Scope-Extended Router Advertisement     July 5, 2008


    
1. Introduction 

   The mobile ad hoc network (MANET) enables mobile nodes to communicate
   via multiple wireless hops without the need of any wired 
   infrastructure[1]. In a MANET, two nodes not within their 
   transmission range have to deliver data to each other through other 
   intermediate nodes. For forwarding packets destined to other nodes, 
   each node must have the routing capability, i.e., the mechanism for 
   establishing data delivery routes between any pair of source and 
   destination nodes, as well as acting as a source and/or a destination 
   node(s). In addition to that, the IP address auto-configuration 
   mechanism suitable for the MANET environment is required. 

   The MANET can be classified into the standalone MANET and the 
   connected MANET. For the connected MANET, the MANET Border Router 
   (MBR) which acts as the gateway connecting the MANET with the 
   external network has been defined. Through the MBR, MANET nodes can 
   communicate with hosts located in the external network. Therefore, 
   MANET nodes have to know the MBR address. One way of obtaining the 
   MBR address is to use the Simplified Multicast Forwarding (SMF)[2]. 
   Another method is to use the Router Advertisement (RA) and the Router 
   Solicitation (RS) messages[3-4]. However, these RA and RS messages 
   are delivered only upto 1 hop, so can not be used in a multi-hop 
   wireless network such as the MANET. In order to overcome this 
   limitation, the modified RA message has been defined for the 
   multi-hop wireless MANET [5]. However, in this approach, the 
   duplicate packet reception problem can occur since, if a node
   broadcasts a RA/RS message, it can receive the same RA/RS message 
   which was re-broadcast by one of its neighbors.

   In this draft, we define the scope-extended Router Advertisement/
   Solicitation message for announcing/solicitating the MBR address in 
   the connected MANET. In the scope-extended RA/RS message, a new 
   message field, the sequence number field, is defined so that 
   duplicate RA/RS messages can be detected based on the sequence 
   number and the IP address included in the message.
