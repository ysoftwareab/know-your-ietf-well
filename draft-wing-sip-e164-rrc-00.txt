Abstract

   SIP lacks a mechanism to determine which domain can claim ownership
   of a certain telephone number.  Due to this, it is impossible to
   establish meaningful identity or to authenticate endpoints that use
   telephone number URIs and domain names in their From address.  This
   document proposes a solution to this problem using a return
   routability test.

Internet-Draft                SIP E.164 RRC                February 2008


1.  Introduction

   SIP [RFC3261] allows using both email-style addresses (user@domain)
   and telephone-style addresses (1234@domain).  The latter is most
   often used with E.164 [ITU.E164.1991] numbers, especially between
   different administrative domains.

   SIP's use of E.164 numbers poses several problems.  This draft
   provides a solution to one of the problems:  determining if a domain
   name rightfully 'owns' an E.164 phone number.  In order to do this, a
   new SIP request is routed towards that E.164 and, if it is received
   by the same domain, that domain is deemed to 'own' that E.164 number.
   This is termed a 'return routability check' (RRC).

   The return routability check relies on SIP routing to ascertain which
   domain 'owns' a certain E.164 number.


2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


3.  Operation

   In order to check if a domain actually 'owns' the E.164 number it
   claims to own, a new SIP request is sent towards that E.164.  Upon
   receipt of a SIP request conaining an E.164 number in the From
   address, the verifying agent in the receiving domain sends a new,
   out-of-dialog request (a SUBSCRIBE) towards that E.164 using the
   verifiering domain's normal routing rules.  This SUBSCRIBE contains a
   body (with a nonce) that the verifying domains wants the owner of the
   E.164 to sign.  That SIP SUBSCRIBE request is routed to the 'owner'
   of that E.164.  Upon receipt of the SUBSCRIBE, the owner of that
   E.164 number generates a NOTIFY request.  This is signed, using
   RFC4474, and sent to the verifying domain.  The verifing domain
   verifies the signature on the NOTIFY.  If it verified, and if the
   same public key was used in the original SIP request and in this
   NOTIFY, the verifying domain has now verified the remote domain
   'owns' that E.164 number.  If a different public key was used in the
   original SIP request and in this NOTIFY, the verifying domain has no
   verified the remote domain does not own that E.164 number.

Internet-Draft                SIP E.164 RRC                February 2008


3.1.  Verifier Operation

   Upon receipt of an INVITE where the From:  address contains a SIP URI
   with an E.164, a Verifier (as defined in [RFC4474]) needs to verify
   if the signer is authorized to sign for that domain.  To do this, the
   Verifier has an additional task:  it sends an out of dialog SIP
   SUBSCRIBE request containing a random nonce to that E.164, using the
   Verifier's default SIP routing rules for routing an E.164 address.
   The domain that owns the E.164 will sign the nonce and send a NOTIFY
   request back.

   The steps the Verifier uses to perform this operation are:

   1.  Strip the domain name of the From:  of the incoming INVITE.  This
       results in a TEL URI.  For example,
       "sip:+14085551234@example.com" is rewritten to
       "tel:+14085551212"s

   2.  Rewrite the TEL URI to a SIP URI, following the Verifier's
       default routing rules.  For example, "tel:+14085551212" is
       rewritten to "sip:+14085551212@example.net", the service provider
       used by the verifying domain).

   3.  Generate a random nonce.

   4.  Using the SIP URI constructed in step (2), construct a SIP
       SUBSCRIBE message with Request-URI and To headers that use that
       SIP URI, and an "Expires" header of 0.  The SUBSCRIBE contains
       the random nonce in its body as Content-Type application/
       return-routability-nonce.

   5.  Send the SUBSCRIBE message.  This will cause the calling party to
       send a NOTIFY.

   Upon receipt of the NOTIFY message, the Verifier performs the
   following steps:

   1.  Validate the [RFC4474] signature of the NOTIFY.

   2.  Extract the application/return-routability-nonce from the NOTIFY,
       and compare it to the nonce that was sent in the SUBSCRIBE.

   3.  Compare the certificate used to sign the NOTIFY is the same
       certificate used to sign the original SIP request that it is
       attempting to validate with this procedure.

       A.  If they match, the E.164 return routability test has
           succeeded.

       B.  If they do not match, the E.164 return routability test has
           failed.

3.2.  Authentication Service or Calling Endpoint Operation

   The steps described in this section can be performed by the
   authentication service or by the calling endpoint.

   The authentication service or the calling endpoint, upon receiving a
   SUBSCRIBE for the return-routability event package, performs the
   following steps:

   1.  The SUBSCRIBE should be immediately acknowledged with a 200 Ok
       message.

   2.  A NOTIFY should be immediately created, containing the same
       application/return-routability-nonce copied from the SUBSCRIBE.
       This NOTIFY contains a To and Request-URI which match the From of
       the SUBSCRIBE.

   3.  This NOTIFY is sent.

   4.  The RFC4474 authentication service, operating at the domain, will
       create a signature over the NOTIFY.  This is used by the remote
       domain's verification service (see Section 3.1).


4.  Performance Considerations

   To reduce SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY traffic, a verifier SHOULD cache
   successful and failed return routability checks.  Successful checks
   will only become unsuccessful if SIP E.164 routing is changed to a
   different terminating domain.  This only occurs when a domain
   relinquishes an E.164, so it is RECOMMENDED that the result of
   ssuccessful tests be cached for 24 hours.  However, unsuccessful
   tests could be a result of misconfiguration and it is useful to re-
   verify such failures in the event the misconfiguration is fixed.
   Thus, it is RECOMMENDED that the result of unsuccessful tests be
   cached for 1 hour.


5.  Deployment Considerations

   Intermediate SIP elements (proxies, SBCs, B2BUAs) MUST all forward
   the application/return-routability-nonce Content-Type.

6.  Security Considerations

   An attacker could cause a domain to perform public key operations by
   sending a bunch of bogus SUBSCRIBE messages.  This can be thwarted by
   only responding with NOTIFYs if there is an active INVITE dialog.
   However, that could disclose information about active calls, and also
   restricts the usefulness of this feature to INVITEs.  More evaluation
   of countermeasures against such an attack is needed.

   document.]]
