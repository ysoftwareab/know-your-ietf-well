 2  Introduction 
    
   This document describes a model for managing pseudo wire services 
   for transmission over a packet Switched Network (PSN). This MIB 
   module is generic and common to all types of PSN. 
   This document is closely related to [FRMWK], describing the 
   transport and encapsulation of L1 and L2 services over any type of 
   PSN and MPLS respectively, creating a Pseudo Wire (PW) service. 
   This document describes the MIB objects that define the generic 
   pseudo wire association to the PSN and pseudo wire configurations 
   that are not specific to the carried service. A PW type field will 
   be used to point to the relevant service MIB tables, described in 
   other documents. Such document is available currently for CEP 
   services [CEPMIB]. A similar PSN type field will point to PSN 
   specific modules, for example [PWMPLSMIB].

 3  Terminology 
    
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the PW 
   framework [FRMWK]. 
    
   "Adaptation" refers to the method of adapting a "foreign" 
   communications protocol such that it can be carried by a packet 
   switched net (the PSN). For example, in a CEP service the foreign 
   protocol is SONET/SDH and the PSN is MPLS.  
    
   "PSN Tunnel" is a general term indicating a virtual connection 
   between the two PW edge devices. In practice, it is not limited to 
   path oriented types of PSNs like MPLS; an example is IP PSN. 
   Since a PW service is bi-directional, a PW service requires two 
   uni-directional tunnels from a uni-directional oriented PSN (MPLS 
   for example).  
    
 4  The SNMP Management Framework  
     
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major 
   components: 
    
   o An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571]. 
    
   o Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the 
   purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of 
   Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in STD 
   16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC 1215 
   [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in STD 
   58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 
   2580 [RFC2580]. 
    
   o Message protocols for transferring management information.  The 
   first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of the 
   SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards track 
   protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901 [RFC1901] and 
   RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the message protocol is 
   called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906 [RFC1906], RFC 2572 
   [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574]. 
    
   o Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The 
   first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is 
   described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of protocol 
   operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905 
   [RFC1905]. 
   o A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573 [RFC2573] 
   and the view-based access control mechanism described in RFC 2575 
   [RFC2575].

                             Information Base 


   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management 
   Framework can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570]. 
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
   are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI. 
   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A 
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate 
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically 
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no 
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable 
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in 
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of 
   machine readable information is not considered to change the 
   semantics of the MIB. 
    
 4.1  Object Definitions  
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, 
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB 
   are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One 
   (ASN.1) defined in the SMI. In particular, an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an 
   administratively assigned name, names each object type. The object 
   type together with an object instance serves to uniquely identify a 
   specific instantiation of the object.  For human convenience, we 
   often use a textual string, termed the descriptor, to also refer to 
   the object type.  
    
 5  Feature Checklist 
    
   The PW MIB (PW-MIB) is designed to satisfy the following 
   requirements and constraints: 
    
    - The MIB is designed to be extensible to all types of PSNs. PSNs  
      specific MIBs will be defined in additional documents. 
    
    - The MIB supports manually configured VCs. 
    
    - The MIB supports the VC ID and Group ID. 
    
    - The MIB supports point-to-point PW connections. Point-to- 
      multipoint connections are for future study.  
    
    - The MIB enables the use of any emulated service. Emulated 
      service specific MIBs will be defined in additional documents.  
 
    - The MIB enables both strict and loose incoming VC lookup. In  
      strict mode, only VC carried inside explicitly configured or 
      signaled tunnels are accepted in path oriented PSNs. In no path  
      oriented PSNs, the source address of the received packet must be  
      checked in strict mode.

 6  PW-MIB usage 
    
   The MIB structure for defining a PW service is composed from three 
   types of modules. 
    
   The first type is the PW-MIB module, which configures general 
   parameters of the VC that are common to all types of emulated 
   services and PSNs. 
    
   The second type of modules is per PSN module. There is a different 
   module for each type of PSN. These modules associate the VC with 
   one or more "tunnels" that carry the service over the PSN. These 
   modules are defined in other documents; see for example 
   [PWMPLSMIB]. 
    
   The third type of modules is service-specific module, which is 
   emulated signal type dependent. These modules are defined in other 
   documents; see for example [CEPMIB]. 
    
   [PWTC] defines some of the object types used in these modules. 
    
 6.1  PW-MIB usage 
    
     - The VC table (pwVcTable) is used for all VC types (ATM, FR, 
     Ethernet, SONET, etc.). This table contains high level generic 
     parameters related to the VC creation. A row is created by the 
     operator for each PW service. 
      
     - Based on the PSN type defined for the VC, rows are created in 
     PSN specific module(for example [PWMPLSMIB]) and associated to the 
     VC table by the common VC index. 
      
     - Based on the VC type defined for the VC, rows are created in 
     service-specific module (for example [CEPMIB]) and associated to 
     the VC table by the common VC index. 
      
     - The MIB includes performance parameters collection common to all 
     types of PW. 
      
 6.2  Relations to the ifTable 
    
   The PW VC itself is not an ifIndex as it's own, however in many 
   cases the VC is associated via the MIB tables to an ifIndex the VC 
   is emulating. This ifIndex may represent a physical entity - for 
   example a PW emulating a SONET path as in CEP. The VC itself is not 
   an ifIndex, however the MIB associate the VC to the ifIndex of the 
   path to be emulated. In some cases, the VC will be associated to an 
   ifIndex representing a virtual interface.  An examples is VPLS 
   service where the PW emulates a logical interface of a (logical) 
   bridge. The physical ports association to the VPLS service instance 
   is defined in non-PW MIBs in this case.

   Note that the ifIndex that carry the VC toward the PSN is in 
   general not explicitly configured via PW MIB modules except in rare 
   cases. In most cases the VC is carried inside a PSN tunnel, and the 
   interfaces carrying the tunnel are specified in the related MIBs 
   that control the PSN tunnels. 
      
 6.3  Example of MIB usage 
    
   In this section we provide an example of using the MIB objects 
   described in section 8 to set up a CEP VC over MPLS PSN. While this 
   example is not meant to illustrate every permutation of the MIB, it 
   is intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts. It 
   is meant to be read after going through the MIB itself. 
   In this example a PW service for CEP is configured over an MPLS PSN 
   (MPLS-TE tunnel). It uses LDP as in [TRANS] for service set-up. 
    
   In PW-MIB: 
    
   In pwVcTable: 
   { 
         pwVcIndex               5, 
          
         pwVcType                CEP, 
         pwVcOwner               signaling, 
         pwVcPsnType             mpls, 
         pwVcPriority            0,

         pwVcID                  10,

         pwVcInboundVcLabel      0xFFFF, -- Will be set by signaling

   The agent now create a row in pwVcMplsTable [PWMPLS] based on the 
   VcIndex, that is configured with MPLS specific values: 
    
   In pwVcMplsTable: 
   { 
         pwVcMplsMplsType        mplsTe, 
         pwVcMplsExpBitsMode     outerTunnel,

         pwVcMplsTtl             2, 
         ... 
   } 
    
   The operator now associates the VC with an outgoing TE tunnel: 
   In pwVcMplsOutboundTable: 
    
   { 
         pwVcMplsOutboundIndex                    0, -- The first row 
                                                  -- for this VcIndex 
         pwVcMplsOutBoundLsrXcIndex               0, -- MPLS-TE  
         pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelIndex              500, 
         pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelInstance           0, 
         pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelLclLSR             1.2.3.4, -- Always  
                                   -- the LSR ID of the current node. 
         pwVcMplsOutboundTunnelPeerLSR            1.4.3.2 
         pwVcMplsOutboundIfIndex                  0, -- MPLS-TE 
    
         .. 
   } 
    
   pwVcMplsInboundTable is not used because loose LDP set-up is used. 
    
   pwVcMplsMappingTable entry will be created by the agent once the 
   LDP control session will be finished and will enable easy lookup 
   for the VcIndex from knowledge of VC label or tunnel.

      DESCRIPTION 
          "This MIB contains managed object definitions for Pseudo 
           Wire operation as in: Pate, P., et al, <draft-ietf-pwe3- 
           framework>, Xiao, X., et al, <draft-ietf-pwe3- 
           requirements>, Martini, L., et al, <draft-martini-

           <draft-martini-l2circuit-encap-mpls>. 
    
           The indexes for this MIB are also used to index the PSN- 
           specific tables and the VC-specific tables. The VC Type 
           dictates which VC-specific MIB to use. For example, a  
           'cep' VC Type requires the use the configuration and status  
           tables within the CEP-MIB. 
    
           This MIB enable the use of any underlying packet switched  
           network (PSN). Specific tables for the MPLS PSN is 
           currently defined in a separate PW-MPLS-MIB. Tables to 
           support other PSNs (IP, L2TP for example) will be added to 
           this MIB in future revisions."

 8  Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that 
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations. 
    
   No managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information. 
    
   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network 
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is 
   no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and 
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB. 
    
   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security 
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the 
   use of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the 
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended. 
    
   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP 
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly 
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals 
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET 
   (change/create/delete) them.
