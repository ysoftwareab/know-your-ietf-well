Internet-Draft     Reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers     December 2008


Abstract

   Interface Identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify
   interfaces on a link.  They are required to be unique within a
   subnet.  Several RFCs have specified interface identifiers or
   identifier ranges that have a special meaning attached to them.  An
   IPv6 node autoconfiguring an interface identifier in these ranges
   will encounter unexpected consequences.  Since there is no
   centralized repository for such reserved identifiers, this document
   aims to create one.

2.  Introduction

   An IPv6 unicast address is composed of two parts : A subnet prefix
   and an interface identifier (IID) that identifies an unique interface
   within the subnet prefix.  The structure of an IPv6 unicast address
   is depicted in the IPv6 Addressing Architecture [RFC4291] and is
   replicated here for clarity.

   |          n bits               |           128-n bits            |
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+
   |       subnet prefix           |           interface ID          |
   +-------------------------------+---------------------------------+

                   Figure 1: IPv6 Unicast Address Format

   For all unicast addresses, except those that start with the binary
   value 000, Interface IDs are required to be 64 bits long and to be
   constructed in Modified EUI-64 format.  Examples of mechanisms that
   generate interface identifiers without an unique token include
   Cryptographically Generated Addresses [RFC3972], Privacy Addresses
   [RFC4941], Hash Based Addresses [HBA] etc.  Non-unique interface
   identifiers can also be allocated using managed address assignment
   mechanisms like DHCPv6 [RFC3315].

2.1.  Applicability

   This document applies only to interface identifiers that are formed
   in the modified EUI-64 format as defined in Appendix A of [RFC4291].
   All other types of interface identifiers are out of scope.

3.  Issues with reusing reserved Interface Identifiers

   Let us assume a node comes up with an interface identifier that has
   been reserved for use in some other capacity. e.g.  An IPv6 node that
   uses temporary IPv6 addresses [RFC4941] comes up with an IID of fdff:
   ffff:ffff:fff .  This node will receive requests from all nodes that
   are requesting a service from a MobileIPv6 home agent since the above
   mentioned interface identifier has been reserved in [RFC2526] to
   serve as a MIPv6 home agents anycast address.  At best this is an
   annoyance to the node that came up with this address.  In the worst
   case scenario another node on the link would be denied service and
   may not look for other methods of acquiring a home agent.  Thus, such
   reserved interface identifiers MUST NOT be used for autonomous auto-
   configuration or for managed address configuration.

3.1.  Possible solutions

   There are two possible ways to go about avoiding usage of these
   reserved interface identifiers.  One of them would be to add
   normative reference to each specification that reserves an interface
   identifier.  The other one would be to create an IANA registry for
   such interface identifiers.  There are two disadvantages to the
   normative reference approach.  Firstly, this approach does not scale
   well.  This is because the number of such specifications that need to
   be updated is large.  Secondly, the maturity level of the document
   reserving the IID might be lower than the one prohibited from using
   it.  This will cause a downward reference problem.  Therefore the
   better solution is to create an IANA registry for this purpose.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests the creation of an IANA registry for reserved
   IPv6 Interface Identifiers.  Initial values for the reserved IPv6
   Interface Identifiers are given below.

   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
   |        Interface Identifier Range       |       Description       |
   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+
   |           0000:0000:0000:0000           |  Subnet-Router Anycast  |
   |                                         |        [RFC4291]        |
   |                                         |                         |
   | FDFF:FFFF:FFFF:FF80-FDFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF | Reserved Subnet Anycast |
   |                                         |    Addresses[RFC2526]   |
   +-----------------------------------------+-------------------------+

                       Table 1: Current Assignments

   It is possible that implementations might predate a specific
   assignment from this registry and hence not be cognizant of the
   reserved nature of the interface identifier.  Hence, future
   assignments from this registry are discouraged.  Future assignments,
   if any, are to be made through Standards Action [RFC5226].
   Assignments consist of a single interface identifier or a range of
   interface identifiers.

   NOTE: Please note that the address :: (all zeros in the interface
   identifier field) is used as the unspecified address and ::/0 is used
   as a default route indicator, as specified in [RFC5156].  These uses
   do not conflict with the reserved interface identifiers defined here,
   since the reserved identifiers defined in this document are used for
   avoiding conflicts with stateless address autoconfiguration that
   utilizes a 64 bit prefix length.

6.  Security Considerations

   By utilizing one of the reserved interface identifiers, an IPv6 node
   might receive requests that it is not authorized to receive.
   Information that creates or updates a registration in this registry
   needs to be authenticated and authorized by the IANA based on the
   instructions set forth by [RFC5226].
