Abstract

   The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol for mobile ad hoc    
   networks is an optimization of the classical link state algorithm    
   tailored to the requirements of a mobile wireless LAN. It reduces 
   the message overhead as compared to a classical flooding mechanism 
   and offers distributed partial link state information in the network 
   using MPRs.

   OLSR provides optimal routes in terms of number of hops. In order to 
   provide and fulfill quality of service (QoS) requirements, 
   extensions can be added to OLSR functioning and control messages 
   format (HELLO and TC). These extensions specify the metrics 
   (available bandwidth, delay, jitter, loss probability, etc.) which 
   must be used for Multipoint relay (MPR) selection and routing table 
   calculation. This memo describes the QOLSR protocol, which is an 
   enhancement of OLSR to support multiple-metric routing criteria like 
   available bandwidth and delay.

1. Introduction

   OLSR protocol is an optimization over the classical link state 
   protocol, developed for the mobile Ad hoc networks. It performs hop-

   by-hop routing, i.e., each node uses its most recent information to 
   route a packet. Therefore, each node selects a set of its neighbor 
   nodes as "MultiPoint Relays" (MPR). In OLSR, only nodes, selected as  
   MPRs, are responsible for forwarding control traffic, intended for 
   diffusion into the entire network. MPRs provide an efficient 
   mechanism for flooding control traffic by reducing the number of 
   transmissions required. Nodes, selected as MPRs, also have a special 
   responsibility when declaring link state information in the network. 
   Hence, only a small subset of links to neighbor nodes is made known 
   in the topology (partial topology). This information is then used by 
   OLSR for route calculation. As of result, routes contain only MPRs 
   as intermediate nodes between a source destination pair. OLSR 
   provides optimal routes in terms of number of hops (shortest path 
   routes). No quality of service is taken into account. For more 
   details, please see the OLSR base specification [1].

   This document presents the QOLSR protocol which is an extension 
   introduced to OLSR to fulfill QoS requirements. It ensures that 
   maximum amount of network capacity (i.e., bandwidth) and minimum 
   delay is made available along a route between communication 
   partners. Additional fields about QoS conditions are added to HELLO 
   and TC messages. No additional control messages are generated. Using 
   QOLSR, a node measures QoS metrics (available bandwidth, delay, 
   jitter, etc.) on links to its neighbor nodes having direct and 
   symmetric link. These QoS metrics information are used to calculate 
   MPRs and then flooded in the network by TC messages to calculate 
   routing tables.

   The heuristic for the selection of MPRs in OLSR limits its number in 
   the network and ensures that the overhead is as low as possible. 
   With this heuristic, good quality links may be hidden to other nodes 
   in the network. Optimal paths (in terms of bandwidth and delay) 
   found by QOLSR using MPR selection of OLSR heuristic in the known 
   partial topology are not optimal in the whole topology [3]. A new 
   heuristic is used by QOLSR to ensure this problem.

   This protocol specification uses conventional meanings [1] for 
   capitalized words such as MUST, SHOULD, etc., to indicate 
   requirement levels for various protocol features.


2. QOLSR Terminology

   The QOLSR protocol uses the same terminology defined in [2] but with 
   single interface.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         QoS for OLSR        October 2004


3. Useful Definitions

   * A path delay is the sum of all delays on each intermediate arc.

   * A path bandwidth is the minimum bandwidth value on intermediate 
     arcs.
 
   * A widest path between two nodes is the path having maximum path 
     bandwidth between those two nodes.

   * A shortest path between two nodes is the path having minimum path 
     delay between those two nodes.

   * A shortest-widest path is the widest path, and with shortest 
     delay when there is more than one widest.


4. QOLSR Characteristics 

   * Does the protocol function proactively? (if so, how?)

       Yes. QOLSR is an extension of OLSR (proactive protocol) to 
       support QoS requirements without addional control messages. Each 
       node periodically sends information about its MPR selectors and 
       their QoS conditions, which enables the nodes to construct 
       routes to these MPR selectors through the node.

   * Does the protocol support multiconstraint path QoS routing?

       No. QOLSR finds routes with maximum available bandwidth and 
       minimum delay. However, optimal path selection under QoS 
       constraints may easily be enabled through extensions to the 
       protocol.
 
   * Does the protocol provide shortest-widest path routes?

       Yes [4].

   * Does the protocol provide loop-free routing? (if so, how?)

       Yes. As the protocol uses a shortest-widest path for routing 
       table calculation, routing is loop-free when in a stable state.

   * Does the protocol require using some form of source routing? (if 
     so, how?)

       No. However, the use of some form of source routing may easily 
       be enabled through optional extensions to the protocol to 
       provide for example reservation mechanism and admission control 
       mechanism.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         QoS for OLSR        October 2004


   * Does the protocol provide support for routing through a multi-
     technology routing fabric? (if so, how?)

       No. However, provisions for multiple interfaces may easily be 
       enabled through extensions to the protocol.

   * Does the protocol provide some form of security? (if so, how?)

       No.

   * Does the protocol provide admission control mechanism? (if so, 
     how?)

       No. 

   * Does the protocol provide reservation mechanism? (if so, how?)

       No. 


5. QOLSR Functioning

   QOLSR is a proactive QoS routing protocol for mobile ad hoc 
   networks. The protocol inherits the stability of a link state 
   algorithm and has the advantage of having optimal routes (in terms 
   of available bandwidth and delay) immediately available when needed 
   due to its proactive nature.

   QOLSR provides end-to-end bandwidth and delay requirements and 
   minimizes flooding of control traffic by using only selected nodes, 
   called MPRs, to retransmit control messages. This technique 
   significantly reduces the number of retransmissions required to 
   flood a message to all nodes in the network. QOLSR requires only 
   partial link state and their QoS information to be flooded in order 
   to provide optimal routes in terms of available bandwidth and delay 
   as those in whole network topology. As in OLSR, all nodes, selected 
   as MPRs, MUST declare the links QoS information to their MPR 
   selectors using TC messages.  

   QOLSR carried out different functions which are required to perform 
   the task of routing.

   * Neighbor detection

      Each node MUST detect the neighbor nodes with which it has a 
      direct and bi-directional link. The uncertainties over radio 
      propagation may make some links uni-directional. Consequently, 
      all links MUST be checked in both directions in order to be 
      considered valid.

INTERNET-DRAFT                         QoS for OLSR        October 2004


      To accomplish this, each node periodically broadcasts HELLO 
      messages, containing the information about its neighbors and 
      their link status. These control messages are transmitted in 
      broadcast mode. These HELLO messages are received by all one hop 
      neighbors, but they are not relayed to further nodes.

   * Neighbor QoS measurement

      Each node MUST estimate the QoS conditions (available bandwidth 
      and delay) on links to each neighbor having direct and symmetric 
      link. Afterwards, QoS conditions in vicinity are broadcasted 
      using additional fields in HELLO messages (See Section 4.2). 
      Consequently, HELLO messages will permit each node to discover 
      its neighborhood up to two hops and their QoS conditions.	
         
   * Multipoint relay selection

      Each node of the network independently selects its own set of 
      MPRs. The MPR set is calculated to contain a subset of the 1-hop 
      neighbors which provides maximum bandwidth and minimum delay to 
      each 2-hop neighbor. The MPR set needs not to be optimal, however 
      it SHOULD be small enough to minimize the flooding of broadcast 
      messages in the network. The information required to perform this 
      calculation is acquired through the periodic exchange of HELLO 
      messages, as described in section 6. MPRs of a given node are 
      declared in the subsequent HELLOs transmitted by this node, so 
      that the information reaches the MPRs themselves. The MPR set is 
      re-calculated when a change in 1 hop or 2 hop neighbor sets with 
      bi-directional link is detected ; or a change is detected in 
      their QoS conditions.

   * MPR and QOS conditions information declaration

      Topology Control extension messages are sent by each MPR node in 
      the network at regular intervals to declare its MPR selector set 
      and QoS conditions. The information diffused in the network by 
      these TC messages will help each node to calculate its routing 
      table.

   * Routing table Calculation

      Each node maintains a routing table which allows it to route 
      packets for the other destinations in the network with maximum 
      bandwidth and minimum delay. The nodes which receive a TC message 
      parse and store some of the connected pairs of form [node, 
      source, bandwidth, delay] where "nodes" are the addresses found 
      in the TC message list. "source" is the MPR selector of "node". 
      "bandwidth" and "delay" represent the available bandwidth and 
      delay on the link between "node" and "source".

      The routing table is built from this database using shortest-
      widest path algorithm (See section 6). 


6. Neighbor detection and QoS measurement

   Through the exchange of QOLSR HELLO messages, each node accumulates 
   information about the network. This information is stored according 
   to the descriptions in this section.


6.1. Neighbor sensing and QoS measurement information base

   The neighborhood information base stores information about 
   neighbors, 2-hop neighbors, MPRs and MPR selectors.

 
6.1.1. Neighbor Set

   A node records a set of "neighbor tuple" (N_addr, N_status, 
   N_Willingness, N_bandwidth, N_delay, N_time) where N_addr is the 
   address of the neighbor, N_status designates the status of the link 
   with that neighbor (MPR, symmetric, heard), N_Willingness is an 
   integer between 0 and 7 (speciefies the node's willingness to carry 
   traffic on behalf of other nodes), N_bandwidth designates the 
   available bandwidth on the link with that neighbor, N_delay is the 
   delay on the link with that neighbor and N_time specifies the time 
   at which this record expires and *MUST* be removed.


6.1.2. 2-hop Neighbor Set

   A node records a set of "2-hop tuples" (N_addr, N_2hop_addr, 
   N_2hop_banwdwidth, N_2hop_delay, N_time), describing symmetric or 
   MPR links between its neighbors and the 2-hop neighborhood. N_addr 
   is the address of a neighbor, N_2hop_addr is the address of a 2-hop 
   neighbor, N_2hop_banwdwidth designates the bandwidth on the link 
   between N_addr and N_2hop_addr, N_2hop_delay is the delay on the 
   link between N_addr and N_2hop_addr, and N_time specifies the time 
   at which a tuple expires and *MUST* be removed.


6.1.4. MPR Selector Set

   A node maintains information for each neighbor which has selected 
   the node as a MPR and their QoS conditions on links. It records a 
   set of MPR-selector tuples (MS_addr, MS_bandwidth, MS_delay, 
   MS_time). MS_addr is the address of a node which has selected the 
   node as MPR, MS_bandwidth is the available bandwidth on the link 
   between the node and its MPR selector with address MS_addr, MS_delay

INTERNET-DRAFT                         QoS for OLSR        October 2004


   is the delay on the link between the node and its MPR selector with 
   address MS_addr, and MS_time specifies the time at which a tuple 
   expires and *MUST* be removed.


6.2. HELLO Message Extension Format 

   This section describes the HELLO message extension to support QoS 
   requirements including available bandwidth and delay.

   HELLO message extension is broadcast to all one-hop neighbors, but 
   are *not relayed* to further nodes. It contains:

   - a list of addresses of symmetric neighbors (to which there exists 
     a symmetric link) and QoS values on links to those neighbors;

   - a list of addresses of heard neighbors and QoS values on links to 
     those neighbors;

   - a list of MPRs and QoS values on links to those MPR neighbors.

   The proposed extension format of a HELLO message is as follows:

   0                   1                   2                   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

   This is sent as the data-portion of the general packet format 
   described in [2] , with the "Message Type" set to HELLO_MESSAGE, the 
   TTL field set to 1 (one).


6.2.1. Description of the fields

   Reserved, Htime, Willingness, Link Code, Link Message Size and 
   Neighbor Address fields are described in [2].
   
   QoS fields values are defined in accordance with QoS parameters to 
   be used in the QOLSR. In this document, only available bandwidth and 
   delay are used. So, the following parameter fields are defined, and 
   MUST appear in this order:
 
   - Available Bandwidth: 16-bit number, measured in bits/second,

   - Delay: 16-bit number, measured in milliseconds.


6.3. HELLO message extension processing

   Upon receiving a HELLO message, the node SHOULD update the neighbor 
   information corresponding to the sender node. It provides the same 
   Algorithm described in OLSR [2] for HELLO processing. Moreover, it 
   adds and updates bandwidth and delay values in Neighbor Set, 2-hop 
   Neighbor Set and MPR Selector Set. 


6.4. Multipoint relay selection 

   The heuristic for the selection of multipoint relays in the standard 
   OLSR does not take into account the bandwidth and delay information. 
   It computes a multipoint relay set of minimal cardinality. Links 
   with high bandwidth and low delay can be omitted. Consequently, the 
   path calculated between two nodes using the known partial topology 
   is not optimal (in terms of available bandwidth and delay) in the 
   whole network. 

   The decision of how each node selects its MPRs is essential to 
   determinate the optimal bandwidth and delay path in the network. In 
   the MPR selection, links with high bandwidth and low delay SHOULD 
   not be omitted.

   With QOLSR, each node in the network selects independently its own 
   set of MPRs. The MPR set MUST be calculated by a node in such a way 
   that it, through the neighbors in the MPR-set, can reach all 2-hop 
   neighbors with maximum bandwidth and minimum delay.

   The following specifies a proposed heuristic for selection of MPRs. 
   The following terminology will be used in describing this algorithm:

   - N(x):   The 1-hop neighbor set of node x containing only symmetric 
             neighbors.

   - N2(x):  The 2-hop neighbor set of node x containing only symmetric 
             neighbors in N(x). The 2-hop neighbor set N2(x) of node x 
             does not contain any 1-hop neighbor of node x.

   - D(x,y): Degree of one hop neighbor node y (where y is a member of 
             N(x)), is defined as the number of symmetric 1-hop 
             neighbors of node y excluding the node x and all the 
             symmetric 1-hop neighbors of node x, i.e., D(x,y)= number 
             of elements of N(y) - {x} - N(x).

   - MPR(x): The multipoint relay set of node x which is running this 
             algorithm.

   The proposed heuristic is as follows:

      1. Start with an empty MPR set MPR(x);

      2. Calculate D(x,y), for all nodes y in N(x);

      3. While there still exist nodes in N2(x) that are not covered by 
         MPR(x):

         3.1. Let z be one of those nodes;      

         3.2. Select that node in N(x) as MPR which provide the 
              shortest-widest path (path with maximum bandwidth and 
              minimum delay) to reach z;        

         3.3. In case of a tie in the above step, select that node 
              which reaches the maximum number of uncovered nodes in 
              N2(x);

         3.4. Mark z as covered;

         3.5. For each node in N(x) which is not in MPR(x), calculate 
              the number of nodes that are reachable through it among 
              the nodes in N2(x) and which are not yet covered by 
              MPR(x);
  
   After selecting the MPRs among the neighbors, the link status of the 
   corresponding one-hop neighbors is changed from SYM_LINK to MPR_LINK 
   in the neighbor table.

   The MPR set is re-calculated when:

   - A change in the neighborhood is detected, i.e. either a symmetric 
     link with a neighbor is failed, or a new neighbor with a symmetric 
     link is added; or

   - A change is detected in the 2-hop neighborhood such that a 
     symmetric link is either detected or broken between a 2-hop 
     neighbor and a neighbour; or

   - A change of bandwidth or delay on links of 1-hop or 2-hop 
     neighborhood is detected. Therefore, a node measures the 
     percentage change of previous bandwidth or delay on each link and 
     the new values. If the bandwidth or delay percentage changes 
     exceed BANDWIDTH_THRESHOLD or DELAY_THRESHOLD respectively [4], a 
     change is detected and the MPR set is re-calculated.
 

7. Multipoint relay information and QoS conditions declaration

7.1. Topology information base

   Each node in the network maintains topological information and QoS    
   conditions about the network. This information is acquired from TC 
   messages and used for routing table calculations.

7.1.1. Topology Set

   For each destination in the network, a "Topology Tuple" (T_dest, 
   T_last, T_bandwidth, T_delay, T_seq, T_time) is recorded. T_dest is 
   the address of a node, which may be reached in one hop from the node 
   with the address T_last. T_bandwidth is the bandwidth on the link 
   between T_dest and T_last, T_delay is the delay on the link between 
   T_dest and T_last, T_seq is a sequence number, and T_time specifies 
   the time at which this tuple expires and *MUST* be removed. In a 
   node, the set of Topology Tuples are denoted the "Topology Set".

7.2. TC Message Extension Format

   An extension TC message is sent by a node in the network to declare 
   its MPR Selector set and its QoS conditions. I.e., the TC message 
   contains the list of neighbors which have selected the sender node 
   as a MPR and their QoS constraints (bandwidth and delay). The 
   sequence number (MSSN) associated with this MPR selector set is also 
   sent with the list. The information diffused in the network by these 
   extension TC messages will help each node to calculate its routing 
   table.

   The proposed extension format of a TC message is as follows:

   etc.


7.2.1. Description of the fields

   ANSN, Reserved and Multipoint Relay Selector Address are described 
   in [2].

   QoS fields values are defined in accordance with the QoS parameters   
   to be used in QOLSR. In this document, only available bandwidth and 
   delay are used. So, the following parameter fields are defined, and 
   MUST appear in this order:
 
   - Available bandwidth: 16-bit number, measured in bits/second,

   - Delay: 16-bit number, measured in milliseconds.


7.3. TC Message Extension Processing

   TC messages are broadcasted and retransmitted by the MPRs in order 
   to diffuse the messages in the entire network.

   The tuples in the topology set are recorded with the topology   
   information that is exchanged through TC extension messages, 
   following the same algorithm for TC message processing described on 
   OLSR RFC3626. Moreover, it adds and updates bandwidth and delay 
   values in Topology Set.


8. Routing table calculation

   Each node maintains a routing table which allows it to route the  
   messages with maximum available bandwidth and minimum delay for the

   other destinations in the network. The routing table is based on the   
   information contained in the neighbor set and the topology set. 
   Therefore, if any of these tables is changed, the routing table is 
   re-calculated to update the route information about each destination 
   in the network. 

   Each entry in the table consists of R_dest, R_next, R_dist, 
   R_bandwidth and R_delay which specifies that the node identified by 
   R_dest is estimated to be R_dist hops away from the local node, and 
   that the one hop neighbor node with address R_next is the next hop 
   node in the route to R_dest. The bandwidth and delay of the selected 
   path to R_dest is R_bandwidth and R-delay respectively. Entries are 
   recorded in the table for each destination in the network for which 
   the route is known. All the destinations for which the route is 
   broken or partially known are not entered in the table.

   To construct the routing table of a node, a shortest-widest path 
   algorithm is run on the graph generated by neighbor and topology 
   sets. The shortest-widest path algorithm [4] consists to find a path 
   with maximum bandwidth (a widest path) using a variant of Dijkstra 
   routing algorithm, and when there is more than one widest path, we 
   choose the one with shortest delay. 

   This routing table is updated when a change is detected in the 
   neighbor set, or the topology set. The update of this routing 
   information does not generate or trigger any messages to be 
   transmitted, neither in the network, nor in the one-hop 
   neighborhood.

          
9. IPv6 Considerations

   All the operations and parameters described in this document used by
   QOLSR for IP version 4 are the same as those used by OLSR for IP
   version 6.  To operate with IP version 6, the only required change 
   is to replace the IPv4 addresses with IPv6 address.  The minimum 
   packet and message sizes (under which there is rejection) should be 
   adjusted accordingly, considering the greater size of IPv6 
   addresses.


10. Proposed Values for Constants

   The constants used in QOLSR (HELLO_INTERVAL, TC_INTERVAL, 
   NEIGHB_HOLD_TIME , etc.) have the same values that those used in 
   OLSR [2]. The new constants are BANDWIDTH_THRESHOLD and 
   DELAY_THRESHOLD, and we proposed the following values: 
   BANDWIDTH_THRESHOLD = 10% and DELAY_THRESHOLD = 10%

11. IANA Considerations

   The type numbers for the extensions in section 4 are to be taken 
   from the space of extensions to OLSR [2].


12. Security Considerations

   This draft specifies mechanisms for handling quality of service. It 
   does not introduce any special security vulnerabilities which were 
   not already present in the OLSR routing protocol [2].
