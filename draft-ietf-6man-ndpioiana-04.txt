   IANA Considerations for IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Prefix Information
                              Option Flags
                      draft-ietf-6man-ndpioiana-04

Abstract

   The Prefix Information Option in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Router
   Advertisement message defines an 8-bit flag field with two flags
   defined and the remaining 6 bits reserved (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 has
   defined a new flag from this field without creating a IANA registry
   or updating RFC 4861.  The purpose of this document is to request a
   new IANA registry for the PIO flags.  This document updates RFC 4861.

1.  Introduction

   The Prefix Information Option (PIO) in the IPv6 Neighbor Discovery
   Router Advertisement defines an 8-bit flag field with two flags
   defined and the remaining 6 bits reserved (Reserved1).  RFC 6275 has
   defined a new flag from this field without creating a IANA registry
   or updating RFC 4861.  The purpose of this document is to to create a
   new registry for the PIO flags.

2.  Current Prefix Information Option flags

   Currently, the Neighbor Discovery Protocol Prefix Information Option
   [RFC4861] contains the following one-bit flags defined in published
   RFCs:


                               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                              |L|A|R|Reserved1|
                              +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

      L - On-link Flag [RFC4861]

      A - Autonomous Address Configuration Flag [RFC4861]

      R - Router Address Agent Flag [RFC6275]

      Reserved1 - Reserved

3.  Updates to RFC4861

   This document updates Section 4.6.2 "Prefix Information" of [RFC4861]
   to point to the new IANA registry that is created in this document.

   Specifically: The current list of flags in the Prefix Information
   Option can be found in IANA-TBD.

4.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA is requested to create a new registry for IPv6 Neighbor
   Discovery Prefix Information Option flags.  This should include the
   current flags in the PIO option.  The format for the registry is:

   The assignment of new flags in the PIO option header require
   Standards Action [RFC8126].

   The registry for these flags should be added to:
