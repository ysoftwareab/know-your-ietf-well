      Stitching Procedures for Static PW in MPLS-TP Environment  
                 draft-ietf-pwe3-mpls-tp-ms-pw-01.txt 


Abstract

   The existing procedures for concatenating static and dynamic
   pseudowires (PWs) do not take into account the PW status Operation,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) messages defined for static PW.
   Also, these procedures do not take into account operator functions
   such Lock Instruct and Loopback introduced as part of MPLS Transport
   Profile (MPLS-TP). This informational document reiterates stitching
   procedures for static PW taking into account all the new proposed
   extensions.  

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task
   Force(IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

1.  Introduction

   The PWE3 Architecture in [1] defines signaling and encapsulation  
   techniques for establishing Single Segment PW (SS-PW) between a pair 
   of terminating PEs. Procedures for stitching two or more static or  
   dynamic SS-PWs to form Multi-Segment PW (MS-PW) are described in
   [2].

   These procedures make use of PW status messages carried in LDP TLV  
   over dynamic PW established via LDP. [3] defines a new PW status OAM 
   message used to carry PW status in-band over static PW. This message 
   makes it possible to exchange PW status end-to-end over a MS-PW  
   consisting of one or more static PW. 

   [5] specifies operator new Operation, Administration, and Maintenance
   (OAM) functions Lock Instruct (LI) and Loopback (LB) for associated  
   bi-directional circuits such as MPLS-TP LSP, SS-PW, and MS-PW in an  
   MPLS Transport Profile (MPLS-TP) environment. These functions enable 
   network operators to lock a circuit (LSP and PW) and operate it in
   loopback mode for testing/management purpose.  

   This informational document describes the application of the existing
   PW stitching procedures taking into consideration LI, LB, as well as 
   PW status OAM messages. 

   This document is a product of a joint Internet Engineering Task Force
   (IETF) / International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication   
   Standardization Sector (ITU-T) effort to include an MPLS Transport   
   Profile within the IETF MPLS and PWE3 architectures to support the   
   capabilities and functionalities of a packet transport network.

3.  Operation 

   In this section, we explain the use of LI/LB mechanisms referring

   can be either static or dynamic. We assume that PWs are carried over

   MPLS-TP LSPs (transport LSPs) so that LI/LB mechanisms can be applied
   at the transport LSP level, as well we consider the application of  
   LI/LB at PW level.

   PW status is sent via LDP message and PW OAM message respectively  
   over dynamic and static PW segments. Note that even though only two  
   PW segments are considered in the examples below, the described  
   procedures are applicable to MS-PWs with more than two segments.

3.1. Lock Operation 

3.1.1. Locking MPLS-TP LSP 

   An MPLS-TP LSP can be taken out of service for maintenance operation 
   using the LI mechanism described in [5]. LI messages are exchanged  
   between MPLS-TP Maintenance End Points (MEPs). In the case of MS-PW, 
   each MPLS-TP LSP associated with a given PW segment can be  
   individually locked for management purpose. This means that, in a MS-
   PW scenario, a T-PE is always a MEP and an S-PE is a MEP for an MPLS-
   TP LSP carrying PW segments. 

3.1.1.1. LI originated at T-PE 

   Assume that T-PE1 originates an LI request for the MPLS-TP LSP
   carrying PW1. The intended recipient of the message will be the S-PE.
   Before locking the MPLS-TP LSP, PW1 and all other PWs associated with
   the MPLS-TP LSP will be taken out of service. This means that PW1 and
   all other impacted PWs will no longer carry user data. 

   When S-PE receives an LI request, before locking the MPLS-TP LSP, the
   S-PE finds all PWs associated with this MPLS-TP LSP and first sends
   the PW status code 0x00000018 (Local PSN-facing PW Receive/Transmit
   Faults) on all stitched PWs segments to T-PE2. PW status code is sent
   over PW OAM message or LDP message depending on whether the segment
   PW2 is static or dynamic. 

   When T-PE2 receives the PW status codes, it processes them as  
   described in [3] or [4] depending on whether PW2 is dynamic or  
   static.

   If PW2 is a dynamic segment and does not support PW status, S-PE  
   needs to withdraw its labels from T-PE2 before locking the MPLS LSP. 

   For better scalability, S-PE may use the notion of group ID described
   in [6] to send PW status or withdraw labels all impacted dynamic PWs 
   between itself and T-PE2. Use of group ID with PW status OAM over  
   static PW is TBD. 

3.1.1.2. LI originated at S-PE 

   Let's assume that an operator wants to originate an LI request at S- 
   PE for the MPLS-TP LSP carrying PW1. The intended recipient of the LI
   request is T-PE1. First, S-PE sends PW status code 0x00000018 (Local 
   PSN-facing PW Receive/Transmit Fault) for PW1 as well as all other
   PWs pinned down to MPLS-TP LSP in question to T-PE1 and PW2 and all
   other stitched PWs other segments to T-PE2. PW status code   is sent
   over PW OAM message or LDP message depending on whether the segment
   PW2 is static or dynamic. When T-PE2 receives the PW status codes, it
   processes them as described in [3] or [4] respectively depending on
   whether PW2 is dynamic or static. It then sends LI request message to
   T-PE1, and PW1 is no longer used for carrying regular user data. 

   If PW2 is a dynamic segment and PW status, S-PE needs to withdraw its
   labels from T-PE1 and T-PE2 before sending LI request to T-PE1. 

   For better scalability, S-PE may use the notion of group ID described
   in [6] to send PW status or withdraw labels all impacted dynamic PWs.
   Use of group ID with PW status OAM over static PW is TBD.  


3.1.2. Locking PW 

   A given PW can also be taken out of service for maintenance operation
   without impacting services over other PWs using the LI mechanism  
   described in [5].  

3.1.2.1. LI originated at T-PE 

   In our example, let's assume that, T-PE1 sends an LI request message 
   to lock PW1. S-PE is the intended recipient (based on the TTL value
   of the PW label). S-PE sends a PW status message with the status code
   0x00000018 (Local PSN-facing PW Receive/Transmit Fault) over PW2 to
   T-PE2, and locks PW1. PW status code is sent over PW OAM message or
   LDP message depending on whether the segment PW2 is static or
   dynamic. When T-PE2 receives the PW status codes, it processes   them
   as described in [3] or [4] depending on whether PW2 is dynamic   or
   static.

3.2. Loopback Operation 

   As described in [5], an MPLS-TP LSP or a PW can be setup to in  
   loopback mode for management purpose, e.g., to test or verify  
   connectivity of the LSP/PW up to a specific node on the path of the  
   MPLS-TP tunnel/PW, and to test the LSP/PW performance with respect to
   delay/jitter, etc. But, prior to operating in loopback mode, an MPLS-
   TP LSP or PW must be successfully locked. 

3.3. Switching Point PE TLV 

   Switching Point PE TLV (S-PE TLV) is used to record information about
   S-PE(s) that a PW traverses. An S-PE TLV contains many sub-TLVs as  
   described in [3]. One such sub-TLV carries the FEC of the last  
   traversed PW segment. 

   In the case of MS-PW containing static PW segment(s), if the last  
   traversed PW segment is statically provisioned, a new sub-TLV  
   containing the FEC defined for static PW in [7] can be used to  
   represent the last traversed PW segment. The new sub-TLV type will be
   defined in [4]. 

3.4. VCCV Procedures 

   The same procedures defined in [3] can be used.

4. Security Considerations 

   This document does not introduce any additional security
   constraints.
