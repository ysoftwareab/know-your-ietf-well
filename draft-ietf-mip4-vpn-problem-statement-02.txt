Internet-Draft    MIPv4 VPN Traversal Problem Statement    February 2004


   Deploying Mobile-IP v4 in networks which are connected to the
   Internet through a VPN (Virtual Private Network) gateway presents
   some problems which do not currently have well-described solutions.
   This document aims to describe and illustrate these problems, and
   propose some guidelines for possible solutions.

Internet-Draft    MIPv4 VPN Traversal Problem Statement    February 2004


1. Introduction

   Mobile IP [RFC3344] agents are being deployed in enterprise networks
   to enable mobility across wired and wireless LANs while roaming
   inside the enterprise Intranet.  With the growing deployment of IEEE
   802.11 access points ("hot spots") in public places such as hotels,
   airports, and convention centers, and wireless WAN data networks such
   as GPRS, the need for  enabling  mobile  users  to  maintain  their
   transport connections and constant reachability while connecting back
   to their  target "home" networks  protected  by  Virtual  Private
   Network (VPN) technology is increasing.  This implies that Mobile IP
   and VPN technologies have to coexist and function together in order
   to provide mobility and security to the enterprise mobile users.

   The goal of this draft is to:
   o  Identify and describe practical deployment scenarios for Mobile IP
      and VPN in enterprise and operator environments.
   o  Identify example usage scenarios for remote users roaming outside
      the "home" network protected by a VPN gateway.
   o  Articulate the problems resulting from Mobile IP and VPN
      coexistence. Specify a set of framework guidelines to evaluate
      proposed solutions, supporting multi-vendor seamless IPv4 mobility
      across IPsec-based VPN gateways.

1.1 Overview of the Problem

   Real life networks typically consist of three different domains from
   a corporate point of view.  The first domain is the Internet (i.e.,
   the untrusted external network).  The second domain is the trusted
   Intranet  (also  referred  to  as  VPN  Domain  in  this document).
   The third domain is the DMZ, which is between the Internet and the
   Intranet.

   Access to the Intranet is typically guarded by both a firewall and a
   VPN device.  The Intranet can only be accessed by respecting the
   security policies in the firewall and the VPN device.

   When MIP is deployed in a corporate network behind a VPN device,
   roaming between these two different domains (i.e., the untrusted
   Internet and the trusted Intranet) becomes problematic.  It would be
   desirable to have seamless session mobility between the two domains,
   because MIP was designed for session mobility regardless of the
   network point of attachment.  Unfortunately, the current MIP
   standards fall short of this promise for an important customer
   segment, corporate users behind VPN gateways.

   Because current standards do not provide for session mobility across
   these two domains the possibility of finding a solution to this

   problem has been investigated.  The goal is to provide seamless
   session mobility when the mobile node moves between these two domains
   or between subnets in either domain.

   From  the  beginning  it  was  also  assumed  that  VPNs  and
   firewalls were to be taken as more or less granted because they have
   much wider deployments than MIP at the present. Therefore  any
   solutions  would  need  to  minimize  impact  on existing VPN and
   firewall deployments, related standards and "de facto" standards.

1.2 Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2. MIP and VPN Deployment Scenarios

   This section describes a set of deployment scenarios where MIP agents
   and VPN gateways have to coexist to provide mobility and security.
   The intention is to identify practical deployment scenarios for MIP
   and VPNs where MIP technology might be extended to solve problems
   resulting from the desire for co-existence.

   In all scenarios, "MN" refers to a mobile node that runs both MIP and
   IPsec-based VPN client software.  The foreign network might  or
   might  not  employ  a  foreign  agent.  And,  the  term "Intranet"
   refers to a private network protected by a VPN gateway and perhaps a
   layer-3 transparent or non-transparent firewall. Please  note  that
   firewalls  are  purposely  omitted  from  the following scenarios,
   because they may be installed in a number of different ways, and the
   fact that this draft's focus is the relationship between MIP and VPN.

   Finally, the scenarios assume that encryption is not enforced inside
   the VPN domain because 1) the VPN domain (Intranet) is viewed as a
   trusted network, and users allowed inside the Intranet are also
   trusted  2) it is a common VPN deployment practice where the VPN is
   used to guard the Intranet resources from unauthorized users attached
   to an untrusted network, and to provide a secure communication
   channel for authorized users to access resources inside the Intranet
   from outside.

   The   following   sub-sections   introduce   five   representative
   combinations of MIPv4 HA and VPN gateway placement.

2.1 MIPv4 HA(s) Inside the Intranet behind a VPN Gateway

   MIPv4 HAs are deployed inside the Intranet protected  by a VPN
   gateway, and are not directly reachable by the MNs outside the
   Intranet.

                                Figure 1

    Direct application of MIPv4 standards [RFC3344] is successfully used
   to provide mobility for users inside the Intranet.  However, mobile
   users outside the Intranet can only access the Intranet resources
   (e.g., MIP agents) through the VPN gateway, which will allow only
   authenticated IPsec traffic inside. This implies that the MIPv4
   traffic has to run inside IPsec, which leads to two distinct
   problems:

   1.  When the foreign network has an FA deployed (as in e.g. CDMA
       2000), MIPv4 registration becomes impossible.  This is because
       the MIPv4 traffic between MN and VPN gateway is encrypted and the
       FA (which is likely in a different administrative domain) cannot
       inspect the MIPv4 headers needed for relaying the MIPv4 packets.
       Please see Section 4.2 for more details.

   2.  In co-located mode, successful registration is possible but the
       VPN tunnel has to be re-negotiated every time the MN changes its
       point of network attachment.

       Please note that the VPN tunnel re-negotiation problem can be
       avoided by the work that the MOBIKE workgroup has been chartered
       to accomplish.

   These problems are articulated in Section 4.

   This deployment scenario may not be common yet, but it is practical
   and becoming important as there is an increasing need for providing
   corporate remote users with continuous access to the Intranet
   resources.

2.2 VPN Gateway and MIPv4 HA(s) on the VPN domain border

   A MIPv4 HA is deployed on the VPN domain border (e.g., in the DMZ)
   together with the VPN gateway, and it is directly reachable by MNs
   inside or outside the Intranet.

                                     .                              .
                                     ................................

                                Figure 2

    The MIPv4 HA has a public interface connected to the Internet, and a
   private interface attached to the Intranet.  Mobile users will most
   likely have a virtual home network associated with the MIPv4 HA's
   private interface, so that the mobile users are always away from home
   and hence registered with the MIPv4 HA.  Furthermore, in deployments
   where the VPN gateway and the HA are placed in a corporate DMZ, this
   implies that  MIPv4  traffic  will  always  be  routed  through  the
   DMZ (regardless of whether MNs are located outside or inside the
   Intranet), which may not be acceptable by IT departments in large
   corporations.

   This deployment can be used with two different configurations: "MIPv4
   inside IPsec-ESP tunnel" and "IPsec-ESP inside MIPv4 tunnel".  The
   "MIPv4 inside IPsec-ESP tunnel" has the same problems as the scenario
   of Section 2.1 (namely, MIPv4 registration becomes impossible when
   the registration is to be done via an FA and furthermore in
   co-located mode, the VPN tunnel has to be re-negotiated every time
   the MN changes its point of attachment).  The "IPsec-ESP inside MIPv4
   tunnel" does not have problems described in Section 2.1, however it
   will require some modifications to the routing logic of the MIPv4 HA
   or the VPN gateway.

2.3 Combined VPN Gateway and MIPv4 HA

   This is similar to deployment scenario described in Section 2.2, with
   the exception that the VPN gateway and MIPv4 HA are running on the

                                Figure 3

    Running MIPv4 HA and VPN on the same machine resolves routing
   related issues that exist in Section 2.2 when a "IPsec-ESP inside
   MIPv4 tunnel" configuration is used. However, it does not promote
   multi-vendor interoperability in environments where MIPv4 HA and VPN
   technologies must be acquired from different vendors.

2.4 MIPv4 HA(s) Outside the VPN domain

   In this scenario, MIPv4 HAs are deployed outside the Intranet (e.g.,
   in an operator network), as depicted in Figure 4 below.

    In this deployment scenario the goal is to provide remote users with
   continuous access to the Intranet resources while they are roaming
   outside the Intranet only (i.e., mobility is not supported inside the
   Intranet).  In this case it is most practical to run IPsec-ESP inside
   a MIPv4 tunnel (i.e., MIPv4 tunnel end-points are the MN and the HA;
   the IPsec-ESP packet from the MN and to the VPN gateway is
   encapsulated in the MIPv4 tunnel) as the MNs can register with the HA
   without establishing an IPsec tunnel to the VPN gateway.  This should
   work without any technical problems.  The IPsec tunnel end-points
   will be the MN and the VPN gateway. The 'home network' will be a
   virtual home network, located at the HA, from which it is possible to
   reach the Corporate Intranet through the VPN gateway.

2.5 Combined VPN Gateway and MIPv4 HA(s) on the Local Link

   This is similar to the deployment scenario described in Section 2.3,
   with the difference that the VPN gateway/HA is sitting on the local
   link. In this the VPN gateway and HA would most naturally be
   co-located in the same box, although this is in no way a requirement.

    This deployment works today without any technical problems with
   IPsec-ESP running inside a MIPv4 tunnel.  If however MIPv4 is run
   inside the IPsec-ESP tunnel it has the same problems as in Section
   2.1 (namely, MIPv4 registration becomes impossible when the
   registration is to be done via an FA and furthermore in co-located
   mode, the VPN tunnel has to be re-negotiated every time the MN
   changes its point of attachment). This deployment is not common or
   practical for large deployments (on the order of thousands of users)
   because of the large and distributed security perimeter.

3. Deployment Scenarios Selection

   The deployment scenarios described in Section 2 were evaluated to
   identify the ones most in need of solving.  The evaluation was done
   based on two main criteria: 1) Is the deployment scenario common and
   practical? and 2) Does the deployment scenario reveal any problems
   resulting from MIPv4 and VPN coexistence?

   There was a consensus about importance and practicality of the
   scenario in Section 2.1 because of rising needs to provide corporate
   remote users with continuous access to their Intranet resources.
   After analyzing each scenario one realizes that problems occurring in
   scenarios in Section 2.2 and Section 2.4 are either the same as or a
   subset of those in the scenario in Section 2.1.  Therefore, solving
   the scenario in Section 2.1 will also solve the scenarios in Section
   2.2 and Section 2.4.  The scenarios in Section 2.3 and Section 2.5 do
   not introduce functional problems resulting from MIPv4 and VPN
   co-existence, hence there is no need to seek a solution.  A solution
   for the deployment scenario in Section 2.1 is therefore seen as
   essential, and this in turn can also be applied to solve problems in
   other scenarios.  For the remainder of this draft, we will articulate
   the roaming scenarios, the problems, and the solution guidelines

   relevant to the scenario in Section 2.1.

4. Problem statement

   This section describes roaming scenarios corresponding to the
   deployment scenario in Section 2.1 where an MN needs to have
   continuous access to the Intranet resources regardless of whether it
   is roaming inside or outside the Intranet, and their associated
   problems. The scenarios are constructed based on a multi-subnetted,
   MIPv4-enabled Intranet (hereafter, referred to as Intranet or VPN
   domain) protected by an IPsec-based VPN gateway as depicted in Figure
   6.

    The Intranet, depicted in Figure 6, may include both wired (IEEE
   802.3) and IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN deployments.  However, it is also
   possible to see IEEE 802.11 deployments outside the Intranet due to
   the perceived lack of current 802.11 security, as depicted in Figure
   7.

4.1 Registering in co-located mode

   In co-located mode, the IPsec tunnel endpoints would be at the MN and
   the VPN gateway, which (supposing we have the scenario described in
   Section 2.1) results in the mobile-ip tunnel from MN to HA being
   encapsulated inside the IPsec tunnel.  See Figure 8 below. This
   scenario is still possible, but has some major drawbacks.

   The MN obtains an address at its point of attachment (via DHCP
   [RFC2131] or some other means), and then first sets up an IPsec
   tunnel to the VPN gateway, after which it can successfully register
   with its HA through the IPsec tunnel. The problem is that in an
   end-to-end security model, an IPsec tunnel that terminates at the VPN
   gateway must protect the IP traffic originating at the MN.  As the
   MN's IPsec tunnel address is the address obtained at the point of

   attachment, it will change during movement, and the VPN tunnel
   security association must be refreshed after each IP subnet handoff.
   This could have noticeable performance implications on real-time
   applications. In effect, we don't have mobility support for the
   tunnel endpoint changes associated with MN movements.

4.2 Registering via an FA

   In the case where a mobile node is in a network where mobility
   support is provided through the use of an FA, and no DHCP allocated
   address and co-located mode is possible, we run into severe trouble.
   Figure 9 below illustrates this:

                                Figure 9

   The mobile node, when arriving at this network, may have a IPsec
   session going with its VPN gateway.  This session will not be passed
   through the FA as long as the MN has not registered and a mip tunnel
   has been set up.  But the MN, which is secure inside the IPsec based
   VPN, will not even hear the FA advertisements.  And any IPsec traffic
   from the Intranet (via the VPN gateway and IPsec tunnel) will not be
   understood by the FA.  Simply put, you could say that the FA needs to
   see the mip tunnel outermost, while the VPN-GW needs to see the IPsec
   tunnel outermost.  Or in more details:

   Firstly, the MN must have a IPsec tunnel established with the VPN-GW
   in order to reach the HA, which places the IPsec tunnel outside the
   mip traffic between MN and HA.  The FA (which is likely in a
   different administrative domain) cannot decrypt MIPv4 packets between
   the MN and the VPN gateway, and will consequently be not able to
   relay the MIPv4 packets.  This is because the MIPv4 headers (which
   the FA should be able to interpret) will be encrypted and protected
   by IPsec.

Internet-Draft    MIPv4 VPN Traversal Problem Statement    February 2004


   Secondly, when the MN is communicating with the VPN-GW, an explicit
   bypass policy for MIP packets is required, so that the MN can hear FA
   advertisements and send and receive MIP registration packets.
   Although not a problem in principle, there may be practical problems
   when VPN and MIP clients from different vendors are used.

   The use of a 'trusted FA' has been suggested in this scenario;
   meaning an FA which is actually a combined VPN GW and FA.  The
   scenario will work fine in this case; effectively we are then
   operating within the VPN established between the two VPN gateways,
   and the case is analogous to deploying mobile-ip within a corporate
   Intranet which is not physically disjoint.  See Figure 10 below.
   However, we cannot expect that e.g. wireless hot-spots or CDMA 2000
   FAs will have VPN gateways with security associations with any given
   corporate network, so this is not particularly realistic in the
   general mobility case.

                               Figure 10

   Furthermore, this solution would leave the traffic between FA and MN
   unprotected, and as this link in particular may be a wireless link,
   this is clearly undesirable.

4.3 Summary: MIP Incompatibilities with IPsec-based VPN Gateways

   An MN roaming outside the Intranet has to establish an IPsec tunnel
   to its home VPN gateway first, in order to be able to register with
   its home agent.  This is because the MN cannot reach its HA (inside
   the private protected network) directly from the outside.  This
   implies that the MIPv4 traffic from the MN to a node inside the
   Intranet is forced to run inside an IPsec tunnel, and hence will not
   be in the clear.  This in turn leads to two distinct problems
   depending on whether the MN uses co-located or non co-located modes
   to register with its HA.

5. Solution Guidelines

   This section describes guidelines for a solution to MIPv4 traversal
   across VPN gateways.

5.1 Preservation of Existing VPN Infrastructure

   o  The solution MUST preserve the investment in existing VPN
      gateways.
   o  The solution MUST provide security which is not inferior to what
      is already provided to existing "nomadic computing" remote access
      users, i.e. for confidentiality, authentication, message
      integrity, protection against replay attacks and related security
      services.

5.2 Software Upgrades to Existing VPN Client and Gateways

   o  The solution SHOULD minimize changes to existing VPN client/
      gateway software.

5.3 IPsec Protocol

   o  The solution SHOULD NOT require any changes to existing IPsec or
      key exchange standard protocols implemented by VPN gateways.
   o  The solution SHOULD NOT require that the VPN gateway or the VPN
      client implement any new protocols in addition to the existing
      standard protocols.

5.4 Multi-Vendor Interoperability

   o  The solution MUST provide multi-vendor interoperability, where
      MIPv4 mobility agents, mobility clients (MN), VPN server, and VPN
      client solutions may come from four different vendors.  This is
      typical for medium and large enterprises which purchase and deploy
      best-of-breed multi-vendor solutions for IP routing, VPNs,
      firewalls etc.

5.5 MIPv4 Protocol

   o  The solution MUST adhere to MIPv4 protocol [RFC3344].  That is,
      the solution MUST NOT impose any changes that violates MIPv4
      protocol.
   o  The solution MAY introduce new extensions to MIPv4 nodes per
      guidelines specified in the MIPv4 protocol [RFC3344].  However, it
      is highly desirable to avoid any changes to MIPv4 mobility agents
      such  as  the  FA  and  HA  in  order  to  overcome  barriers  to
      deployment.

Internet-Draft    MIPv4 VPN Traversal Problem Statement    February 2004


   o  The solution MAY require more than one instance of MIPv4 running
      in parallel (multiple encapsulation).

5.6 Handoff Overhead

   o  It is imperative to keep the key management overhead down to a
      minimum, in order to support fast handoffs across IP subnets.
      Hence, the solution MUST propose a mechanism to avoid or minimize
      IPsec tunnel SA renegotiation and IKE renegotiation as the MN
      changes its current point of network attachment.

5.7 Scalability, Availability, Reliability, and Performance

   o  The solution complexity MUST increase at most linearly with the
      number of MNs registered and accessing resources inside the
      Intranet.
   o  The solution MAY introduce additional header or tunnelling
      overhead if needed.

5.8 Functional Entities

   o  The solution MAY introduce new MIPv4 compliant functional
      entities.

5.9 Implications of Intervening NAT Gateways

   o  The solution MUST be able to leverage the existing MIPv4 and IPsec
      NAT traversal solutions [RFC3519][IPSEC-NAT][IKE-NAT].

5.10 Security Requirements

   o  The solution MUST NOT introduce any new vulnerabilities to the
      MIPv4 or IPsec as specified in related RFCs.

6. Security Considerations

   This document describes an existing problem and proposes guidelines
   for possible solutions; as such its security implications are
   indirect, through the guidelines it proposes for the solutions.
   Section 5.10 gives the relevant security requirements.
