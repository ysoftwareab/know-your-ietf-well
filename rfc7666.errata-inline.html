1.  Introduction

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for use with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  In particular, this specifies objects for managing
   virtual machines controlled by a hypervisor (a.k.a. virtual machine
   monitor).  A hypervisor controls multiple virtual machines on a
   single physical machine by allocating resources to each virtual
   machine using virtualization technologies.  Therefore, this MIB
   module contains information on virtual machines and their resources
   controlled by a hypervisor as well as information about a
   hypervisor&#x27;s hardware and software.

   The design of this MIB module has been derived from product-specific
   MIB modules -- namely, a MIB module for managing guests of the Xen
   hypervisor [Xen], a MIB module for managing virtual machines
   controlled by the VMware hypervisor [VMware], and a MIB module using
   the libvirt programming interface [libvirt] to access different
   hypervisors.  However, this MIB module attempts to generalize the
   managed objects to support other implementations of hypervisors.

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Overview and Objectives

   This document defines a portion of MIB for the management of virtual
   machines controlled by a hypervisor.  This MIB module consists of the
   managed objects related to system and software information of a
   hypervisor, the list of virtual machines controlled by the
   hypervisor, and information of virtual resources allocated to virtual
   machines by the hypervisor.  This document specifies four specific
   types of virtual resources that are common to many hypervisor
   implementations: processors (CPUs), memory, network interfaces
   (NICs), and storage devices.  These managed objects are independent
   of the families of hypervisors or operating systems running on
   virtual machines.

           Figure 1: An Example of a Virtualization Environment

   On the common implementations of hypervisors, a hypervisor allocates
   virtual resources from physical resources: virtual CPUs, virtual
   memory, virtual storage devices, and virtual network interfaces to
   virtual machines as shown in Figure 1.  Since the virtual resources
   allocated to virtual machines are managed by the hypervisor, the MIB
   objects are managed at the hypervisor.  In case that the objects are
   accessed through the SNMP, an SNMP agent is launched at the
   hypervisor to provide access to the objects.

   The objects are managed from the viewpoint of the operators of
   hypervisors, but not the operators of virtual machines; that is, the
   objects do not take into account the actual resource utilization on
   each virtual machine but rather the resource allocation from the
   physical resources.  For example, vmNetworkIfIndex indicates the
   virtual interface associated with an interface of a virtual machine
   at the hypervisor, and consequently, the &#x27;in&#x27; and &#x27;out&#x27; directions
   denote &#x27;from a virtual machine to the hypervisor&#x27; and &#x27;from the
   hypervisor to a virtual machine&#x27;, respectively.  Moreover,
   vmStorageAllocatedSize denotes the size allocated by the hypervisor,
   but not the size actually used by the operating system on the virtual
   machine.  This means that vmStorageDefinedSize and
   vmStorageAllocatedSize do not take different values when the
   vmStorageSourceType is &#x27;block&#x27; or &#x27;raw&#x27;.

   The objectives of this document are the following: 1) this document
   defines the MIB objects common to many hypervisors for the management
   of virtual machines controlled by a hypervisor, and 2) this document
   clarifies the relationship with other MIB modules for managing host
   computers and network devices.

4.  Structure of the VM-MIB Module

   The MIB module is organized into a group of scalars and tables.  The
   scalars below &#x27;vmHypervisor&#x27; provide basic information about the
   hypervisor.  The &#x27;vmTable&#x27; lists the virtual machines (guests) that
   are known to the hypervisor.  The &#x27;vmCpuTable&#x27; provides the mapping
   table of virtual CPUs to virtual machines, including CPU time used by
   each virtual CPU.  The &#x27;vmCpuAffinityTable&#x27; provides the affinity of
   each virtual CPU to a physical CPU.  The &#x27;vmStorageTable&#x27; provides
   the list of virtual storage devices and their mapping to virtual
   machines.  In case that an entry in the &#x27;vmStorageTable&#x27; has a
   corresponding parent physical storage device managed in
   &#x27;vmStorageTable&#x27; of HOST-RESOURCES-MIB [RFC2790], the entry contains
   a pointer &#x27;vmStorageParent&#x27; to the physical storage device.  The
   &#x27;vmNetworkTable&#x27; provides the list of virtual network interfaces and
   their mapping to virtual machines.  Each entry in the
   &#x27;vmNetworkTable&#x27; also provides a pointer &#x27;vmNetworkIfIndex&#x27; to the
   corresponding entry in the &#x27;ifTable&#x27; of IF-MIB [RFC2863].  In case
   that an entry in the &#x27;vmNetworkTable&#x27; has a corresponding parent
   physical network interface managed in the &#x27;ifTable&#x27; of IF-MIB, the
   entry contains a pointer &#x27;vmNetworkParent&#x27; to the physical network
   interface.

              Figure 2: State Transition of a Virtual Machine

   The &#x27;vmAdminState&#x27; and &#x27;vmOperState&#x27; textual conventions define an
   administrative state and an operational state model for virtual
   machines.  Events causing transitions between major operational
   states will cause the generation of notifications.  Per virtual
   machine (per-VM) notifications (vmRunning, vmShutdown, vmPaused,
   vmSuspended, vmCrashed, vmDeleted) are generated if
   vmPerVMNotificationsEnabled is true(1).  Bulk notifications
   (vmBulkRunning, vmBulkShutdown, vmBulkPaused, vmBulkSuspended,
   vmBulkCrashed, vmBulkDeleted) are generated if
   vmBulkNotificationsEnabled is true(1).  The overview of the
   transition of &#x27;vmOperState&#x27; by the write access to &#x27;vmAdminState&#x27; and
   the notifications generated by the operational state changes are
   illustrated in Figure 2.  The detailed state transition is summarized
   in Appendix A.  Note that the notifications shown in this figure are
   per-VM notifications.  In the case of Bulk notifications, the prefix
   &#x27;vm&#x27; is replaced with &#x27;vmBulk&#x27;.

   The bulk notification mechanism is designed to reduce the number of
   notifications that are trapped by an SNMP manager.  This is because
   the number of virtual machines managed by a bunch of hypervisors in a
   data center possibly becomes several thousands or more, and
   consequently, many notifications could be trapped if these virtual
   machines frequently change their administrative state.  The per-VM
   notifications carry more detailed information, but the scalability is
   a problem.  The notification filtering mechanism described in
   Section 6 of RFC 3413 [RFC3413] is used by the management
   applications to control the notifications.

5.  Relationship to Other MIB Modules

   The HOST-RESOURCES-MIB [RFC2790] defines the MIB objects for managing
   host systems.  On systems implementing the HOST-RESOURCES-MIB, the
   objects of HOST-RESOURCES-MIB indicate resources of a hypervisor.
   Some objects of HOST-RESOURCES-MIB are used to indicate physical
   resources through indexes.  On systems implementing
   HOST-RESOURCES-MIB, the &#x27;vmCpuPhysIndex&#x27; points to the processor&#x27;s
   &#x27;hrDeviceIndex&#x27; in the &#x27;hrProcessorTable&#x27;.  The &#x27;vmStorageParent&#x27;
   also points to the storage device&#x27;s &#x27;hrStorageIndex&#x27; in the
   &#x27;hrStorageTable&#x27;.

   The IF-MIB [RFC2863] defines the MIB objects for managing network
   interfaces.  Both physical and virtual network interfaces are
   required to be contained in the &#x27;ifTable&#x27; of IF-MIB.  The virtual
   network interfaces in the &#x27;ifTable&#x27; of IF-MIB are pointed from the
   &#x27;vmNetworkTable&#x27; defined in this document through a pointer
   &#x27;vmNetworkIfIndex&#x27;.  In case that an entry in the &#x27;vmNetworkTable&#x27;

   has a corresponding parent physical network interface managed in the
   &#x27;ifTable&#x27; of IF-MIB, the entry contains a pointer &#x27;vmNetworkParent&#x27;
   to the physical network interface.

   The objects related to virtual switches are not included in the MIB
   module defined in this document though virtual switches MAY be placed
   on a hypervisor.  This is because the virtual network interfaces are
   the lowest abstraction of network resources allocated to a virtual
   machine.  Instead of including the objects related to virtual
   switches, for example, IEEE8021-BRIDGE-MIB [IEEE8021-BRIDGE-MIB] and
   IEEE8021-Q-BRIDGE-MIB [IEEE8021-Q-BRIDGE-MIB] could be used.

   The other objects related to virtual machines such as management IP
   addresses of a virtual machine are not included in this MIB module
   because this MIB module defines the objects common to general
   hypervisors, but they are specific to some hypervisors.  They may be
   included in the entLogicalTable of ENTITY-MIB [RFC6933].

   The SNMPv2-MIB [RFC3418] provides an object &#x27;sysObjectID&#x27; that
   identifies the network management subsytem and an object &#x27;sysUpTime&#x27;
   that reports the uptime of the network management portion of the
   system.  The HOST-RESOURCES-MIB [RFC2790] provides an object
   &#x27;hrSystemUptime&#x27; that reports the uptime of the host&#x27;s operating
   system.  To complement these objects, the new &#x27;vmHvUpTime&#x27; object
   reports the time since the hypervisor was last re-initialized, and
   the new &#x27;vmHvObjectID&#x27; provides an identification of the hypervisor
   software.

       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
               &quot;A unique value, greater than zero, identifying a
               virtual machine.  The value for each virtual machine
               MUST remain constant at least from one re-initialization

       STATUS       current
       DESCRIPTION
               &quot;This textual convention is an extension of the
               VirtualMachineIndex convention.  This extension permits
               the additional value of zero.  The meaning of the value
               zero is object-specific and MUST therefore be defined as
               part of the description of any object that uses this
               syntax.  Examples of the usage of zero might include
               situations where a virtual machine is unknown, or when
               none or all virtual machines need to be referenced.&quot;

               &quot;Each octet within this value specifies a set of eight
               virtual machine vmIndex values, with the first octet
               specifying virtual machine 1 through 8, the second octet
               specifying virtual machine 9 through 16, etc.  Within
               each octet, the most significant bit represents the
               lowest-numbered vmIndex, and the least significant bit
               represents the highest-numbered vmIndex.  Thus, each
               virtual machine of the host is represented by a single
               bit within the value of this object.  If that bit has
               a value of &#x27;1&#x27;, then that virtual machine is included
               in the set of virtual machines; the virtual machine is
               not included if its bit has a value of &#x27;0&#x27;.&quot;

               unknown(1)     The media type is unknown, e.g., because
                              the implementation failed to obtain the
                              media type from the hypervisor.

               other(2)       The media type is other than those
                              defined in this conversion.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines the first version of the IANA-maintained
   IANA-STORAGE-MEDIA-TYPE-MIB module, which allows new storage media
   types to be added to the enumeration in IANAStorageMediaType.  An
   Expert Review, as defined in RFC 5226 [RFC5226], is REQUIRED for each
   modification.

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

         Descriptor                OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------                -----------------------

         vmMIB                     { mib-2 236 }
         ianaStorageMediaTypeMIB   { mib-2 237 }

8.  Security Considerations

   This MIB module is typically implemented on the hypervisor not inside
   a virtual machine.  Virtual machines, possibly under other
   administrative domains, would not have access to this MIB as the SNMP
   service would typically operate in a separate management network.

   There are two objects defined in this MIB module,
   vmPerVMNotificationsEnabled and vmBulkNotificationsEnabled, that have
   a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write.  Enabling notifications can lead
   to a substantial number of notifications if many virtual machines
   change their state concurrently.  Hence, such objects may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The
   support for SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper
   protection can have a negative effect on the management system.  It
   is RECOMMENDED that these objects have access of read-only instead of
   read-write on deployments where SNMPv3 strong security (i.e.,
   authentication and encryption) is not used.

   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   sensitive information.  The objects in the vmHvSoftware and
   vmHvVersion list information about the hypervisor&#x27;s software and
   version.  Some may wish not to disclose to others which software they
   are running.  Further, an inventory of the running software and
   versions may be helpful to an attacker who hopes to exploit software
   bugs in certain applications.  Moreover, the objects in the vmTable,
   vmCpuTable, vmCpuAffinityTable, vmStorageTable, and
   vmNetworkTable list information about the virtual machines and their
   virtual resource allocation.  Some may wish not to disclose to others
   how many and what virtual machines they are operating.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending
   them over the network via SNMP.  Not all versions of SNMP provide
   features for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPsec), there is no control as
   to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
   (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB module.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider using the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model [RFC3414] and the View-based Access
   Control Model [RFC3415] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
