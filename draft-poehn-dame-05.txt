Integration of Dynamic Automated Metadata Exchange into the SAML 2.0 Web
                          Browser SSO Profile
                          draft-poehn-dame-05

Abstract

   This document specifies the integration of Dynamic Automated Metadata
   Exchange (DAME) through an intermediate trusted third party into the
   Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0 Web Browser SSO
   Profile.  The user-triggered, on-demand, and fully automated metadata
   exchange between identity provider (IDP) and service provider (SP) is
   intended for scenarios in which the a-priori, e.g., federation-based
   exchange of SAML metadata is neither practical, scalable nor
   mandatory for non-technical aspects, such as contract-based trust
   building between IDP and SP.  The main benefit of DAME is the removal
   of waiting times for users and manual setup tasks for IDP and SP
   administrators before users can access the service.  Implementations
   of DAME can leverage existing metadata repositories, such as REEP,
   and metadata transfer protocols, such as MD Query.

1.  Introduction

   In a federated identity management scenario, enabling communication
   between an identity provider and a service provider is possible
   within trust boundaries, which typically entails joining one or
   several federations before the exchange of metadata takes place.  The
   exchange of SAML metadata is out of scope of the SAML specifications,
   but normally done by pre-sharing metadata files of all entities
   within the trust boundaries.

   This document specifies the HTTP-based [RFC7230] integration of SAML
   metadata exchange into the SAML2 Web Browser SSO
   [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os] profile.  Focusing on the automation and

   the on-demand initiation of the metadata exchange between an identity
   provider and a service provider to build a form of opportunistic
   trust, even if these do not share membership in a common federation
   a-priori or if regular federation scenarios are not suitable.  This
   could be the case in projects containing partners outside regular
   federations.  The initiation of the metadata exchange starts after
   the identity provider discovery in order to keep the user experience
   consistent with traditional federation-based service access.

   This document specifies the initiation of the metadata exchange but
   does not anticipate the use of either a public metadata registry or
   the metadata query itself.  The metadata exchange is triggered by a
   trusted third party, which does not interfere in further
   communication once identity provider and service provider have
   successfully exchanged their metadata.  In contrast to identity
   provider proxies, the trusted third party does not cache assertions
   nor is it involved in subsequent communication.  Integrated identity
   provider discovery, the mutual exchange of required SAML metadata,
   and user authentication take place in a fully automated, user-
   initiated, and on-demand manner.  To provide a flexible solution,
   either pull-based metadata exchange, such as the SAML Profile for MD
   Query [I-D.young-md-query-saml], or any kind of push mechanism can be
   used.

   The degree of integration chosen for DAME explicitly does not imply
   that disclosing personally identifiable information is required from
   an identity provider by sending it to any particular service
   provider.  This is left to appropriate means, e.g., explicitly
   acquiring user consent, in compliance with regulations and policies.

   The described integration addresses the protocol, content and
   processing of SAML messages for interoperability, referring to
   [SAML2Int], but also specifies some deployment details and phases for
   cross-boundary trust.  Fitting in seamlessly with implemented SAML-
   based SSO workflows and being scalable for a large number of users
   and entities without exceeding administrative procedures, it enables
   to participate in dynamically set up federations.

1.2.  Terminology

   This document uses identity management terminology from [RFC6973] and
   [OASIS.saml-glossary-2.0-os].  In particular, this document uses the
   terms identity provider, service provider and identity management.
   Furthermore, it uses following terminology:

   Entity - A single logical construct for which metadata is provided.
   This is usually either a service provider (SP) or an identity
   provider (IDP).

   Metadata - The SAML metadata specification is a machine-readable
   description of certain entity characteristics and contains
   information about, e.g., identifiers, endpoints, certificates and
   keys.

   Trusted Third Party - An intermediate entity facilitating interaction
   between different entities, which trust the third party (TTP).

2.  SAML Profiles and Bindings

   Based on [OASIS.saml-profiles-2.0-os], SAML profiles define rules how
   to embed SAML assertions in or combine them with other objects as
   files or protocol data units of communication protocols.  The profile
   defined in this document is based on the existing SAML Web Browser
   SSO profile, which implements the SAML Authentication Request
   protocol [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] enhanced by a trusted entity
   between an originating party (IDP) and a receiving party (SP).

   A SAML binding [OASIS.saml-bindings-2.0-os] maps request-response
   messages of the SAML protocol onto standard communication protocols.
   For compliance reasons with the underlying Web Browser SSO profile,
   the SAML HTTP Redirect and HTTP POST Bindings MUST be used.

   SAML metadata information MUST be extended to support this protocol.
   For each entity a MetadataSyncLocation MUST be defined, e.g., for an
   IDP idp.example.net.  To ensure conformity and uniqueness of the
   attribute the URN namespace for GEANT [RFC4926] MUST be used:

          <md:Extensions>
            <dame:DAMEInfo xmlns:dame="urn:geant:dame">
              <dame:MetadataSyncLocation>
                https://idp.example.net/idp/profile/SAML2/DAME
              </dame:MetadataSyncLocation>
            </dame:DAMEInfo>
          </md:Extensions>

3.  Protocol

   The protocol defined in this document MUST be divided into two
   phases:

   o  Discovery of the appropriate IDP

   o  User authentication on behalf of the SP through a TTP

      A.  User authentication to TTP

      B.  On-demand metadata exchange

      C.  User authentication to SP

   The protocol defined in this document primarily adds the on-demand
   metadata exchange between IDP and SP, which is triggered by the user.
   The exchange of the metadata itself is explicitly out of scope.  The
   authentication to the TTP step in the latter phase is required due to
   the security considerations discussed below.

3.1.  Identifier

   entityID - Specifies the unique identity of an entity, whose metadata
   is exchanged, as specified in [OASIS.saml-metadata-2.0-os] and
   [OASIS.saml-idp-discovery].

3.2.  IDP Discovery

   A web user attempts to access a secured resource provided by a SP via
   an HTTP user agent.  Missing an established technical trust
   relationship, a certain IDP MUST be discovered by the discovery
   functionality that is integrated into or accessible via the TTP.

                  Figure 1: Identity provider discovery.

3.2.1.  Redirect to trusted third party

   Analogous to the SAML identity provider discovery profile
   [OASIS.saml-idp-discovery], the SP redirects the user agent to the
   TTP with an HTTP GET request including the REQUIRED or OPTIONAL
   parameters specified in [OASIS.saml-idp-discovery].

   In distinction to the existing discovery profile, the OPTIONAL
   "isPassive" parameter, which controls the visible interaction with
   the user agent, SHOULD NOT be set to "true" in this profile.  If the
   parameter "isPassive" is used, the request sent to the TTP MUST
   contain the entityID of the IDP as a URL query.  The URL query is
   indicated by the '?' operator, followed by variable name entityID,
   '=', and the variable's value [RFC3986].  This template provides both
   a structural description and machine-readable instructions.

   The URLs of the participating entities MUST be known to the TTP
   through the metadata.  The URLs depend on the implementation and MAY
   include the literal string "DAME" as query [RFC3986], indicating the
   usage of this profile for dynamic automated metadata exchange.

3.2.2.  Response to service provider

   The TTP MUST respond by redirecting the user agent back to the
   requesting SP with an HTTP GET request message to the location
   specified in the return parameter of the original request.  The
   unique identifier of the selected IDP MUST be included as value of
   the query string parameter specified as returnIDParam or the entityID
   if no parameter was supplied.

Internet-Draft  Metadata Exchange in SAML Web SSO Profile       May 2016


3.2.3.  Failure processing

   If the IDP was not determined or the discovery service cannot answer
   or an unspecified communication error occurs, the discovery service
   MAY halt further processing, either displaying an error message to
   the user agent or redirecting the user agent back to the SP.

3.2.4.  Further actions

   After receiving the information about the selected IDP it is
   RECOMMENDED that the SP verifies acceptance.  If the IDP has not been
   accepted, the SP halts processing and displays an error message to
   the user agent.

3.3.  Authentication Request Protocol using a TTP

   In the second phase of the protocol user authentication MUST be
   performed.  The trusted third party relays the SP's authentication
   request to the IDP.  For this step, the authentication request of the
   SP is cached and a new authentication request is sent to the IDP as
   both entities do not have previously exchanged their metadata.  These
   authentication requests are REQUIRED to ensure that a metadata
   exchange will be initiated only if the user has successfully been
   authenticated by the selected IDP.

        Figure 2: User authentication Request Protocol using a TTP.

3.3.1.  User authentication to trusted third party

   In the first sub-phase the user MUST be authenticated by the selected
   identity provider, but in distinction to [OASIS.saml-idp-discovery],
   the trusted third party initiates the authentication.

3.3.1.1.  Authentication Request of SP to TTP

   After accepting the selected IDP, the SP creates and sends a SAML
   Authentication Request message (AuthnRequest) to the TTP using an
   HTTP Redirect to transfer the message through the user agent.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that this request message is signed or otherwise
   authenticated and integrity-protected by the requesting SP.

Internet-Draft  Metadata Exchange in SAML Web SSO Profile       May 2016


3.3.1.2.  Store AuthnRequest at TTP

   The TTP MUST temporarily store the SAML AuthnRequest message by means
   out of scope of this specification.

3.3.1.3.  Authentication Request of TTP to IDP

   After that, a second SAML AuthnRequest message MUST be sent by the
   trusted third party to the selected IDP using a HTTP redirect message
   to authenticate the user.  The OPTIONAL "ForceAuthn"
   [OASIS.saml-core-2.0-os] parameter MAY be included in the request.
   The AuthnRequest message SHOULD be signed or otherwise authenticated
   and integrity protected by the TTP or by the protocol binding used to
   deliver the message.

3.3.1.4.  User authentication

   The user MUST be identified and authenticated by the IDP by some
   means out of scope of this profile.  A new authentication SHOULD be
   performed unless the IDP can rely on a previously authenticated
   session.  A previous session MUST NOT be reused if the request
   contains a "ForceAuthn" parameter.

3.3.1.5.  Authentication Response to TTP

   The IDP MUST issue a SAML AuthnResponse message to the TTP containing
   one or more assertions or an error message with a status describing
   the error occurred.  The HTTP POST binding MUST be used to transfer
   the message.  It is RECOMMENDED that the message is signed by the IDP
   or otherwise authenticated or integrity-protected.

3.3.2.  Metadata Exchange orchestrated by TTP

   In the second sub-phase, the metadata of SP and IDP are exchanged in
   a way that is orchestrated and synchronized by the TTP.

3.3.2.1.  MDI Request

   After the user has been authenticated, the TTP MUST initiate the
   metadata integration (MDI) between IDP and SP by a metadata
   integration request.  The URL [RFC3986] sent to the entities for the
   MDI request SHOULD contain the query elements {?action,entityID}. The
   variable name 'action' MUST be followed by '=' and the variable's
   value 'fetchmetadata'.  The variable name 'entityID' is followed by
   '=' and the variable's value.

   The means used for the metadata exchange are implementation-
   dependent.  The TTP MAY trigger a metadata query as described by the

   work in progress about the Metadata Query Protocol
   [I-D.young-md-query] and the SAML Profile for the Metadata Query
   Protocol [I-D.young-md-query-saml].

   IDP and SP MUST integrate each other's metadata in their
   configuration.  It is RECOMMENDED that the IDP is triggered regarding
   metadata integration before the SP because it MAY object to accepting
   certain service providers.  But any kind of concurrent operation MAY
   be supported.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the TTP queries the IDP before the metadata
   exchange because it MAY be the case that the IDP has already
   integrated the SP's metadata.  The IDP SHOULD then indicate the found
   metadata by the appropriate HTTP status code according to
   [I-D.young-md-query].

3.3.2.2.  MDI Response

   After each other's metadata is integrated, each entity MUST send a
   metadata integration response message to the TTP containing the
   status of the integration by the HTTP status code.

   If an entity was not able to integrate the metadata before sending
   the response, the status MUST indicate this state and a new request
   MUST be sent by the entity containing the status after the
   integration.

   If an error occurs integrating the metadata, the message MUST contain
   a HTTP status code describing the error and the TTP MUST halt further
   processing by displaying an error message to the user agent.  It is
   RECOMMENDED to roll back any configuration changes by some means out
   of scope of this specification.

3.3.3.  User authentication to service provider

   In last step the stored AuthnRequest of the SP MUST be presented by
   the TTP to the IDP if no error occurred beforehand.  Because of the
   successful user authentication already initiated by the trusted third
   party, the IDP SHOULD respond with an assertion transferred to the
   service provider without further act of authentication, except for
   the case where the request contains a "ForceAuthn" parameter.

   The IDP MUST issue a SAML AuthnResponse message to the services
   provider's AssertionConsumerServiceURL.  After receiving the
   response, the SP MUST decide if the user gets access to the requested
   resource based on the information contained within the SAML
   assertion.

4.  Example

   Considering two organizations, SP S (sp.example.com) and identity
   provider I (idp.example.net).  User U initiates the SAML metadata
   exchange between these entities using an user agent through the TTP T
   (ttp.example.org).

4.1.  IDP Discovery

   After requesting access to a secured resource via HTTPS, S redirects
   U to the discovery service of T:

        GET /discovery/DAME?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fsp.example.com%2FSSO
           &return=https%3A%2F%2Fsp.example.com%2FSSO%2FTTP%3FSAMLDS%3D1
           %26target%3Dtarget HTTP/1.x
        Host: ttp.example.org

   U selects an appropriate IDP I.  T redirects U back to S using the
   following message:

        HTTP/1.x 302 Found
        ...
        Location: https://sp.example.com/SSO/DAME?SAMLDS=1&target=target
        &entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.example.net%2Fidp%2FSAMLidp

        GET /SSO/DAME?SAMLDS=1&target=target
          &entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.example.net%2Fidp%2FSAMLidp
        Host: sp.example.com

4.2.  Authentication Request Protocol using a TTP

   Receiving U's selection, S redirects the user to T containing a SAML
   authentication request (AuthnRequest1):

          HTTP/1.x 302 Found
          ...
          Location:
          https://ttp.example.org/discovery/DAME?action=authenticate
          &idpEntityID=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.example.net%2Fidp%2FSAMLidp
          &SAMLRequest=fZHNTsMwEIRfJf.....
          ...

          GET /DAME?action=authenticate
             &SAMLRequest=fZHNTsMwEIRfJf.....
             &RelayState=target
          Host: ttp.example.org

   T temporarily stores the authentication request and redirects U to I
   sending a second authentication request (AuthnRequest2) containing
   the SAML request:

          GET /idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO
             ?SAMLRequest=lZLBbhshEIZfBXHfh..... HTTP/1.x
          Host: idp.example.net

   After successful authentication, I issues a SAML authentication
   response message to T:

          POST /SSO/SAML2/POST HTTP/1.x
          POSTDATA
             Referer:...
             Set-Cookie:...

   As U is successfully authenticated, I and S are triggered to fetch
   each others metadata by T using the appropriate
   TTPMetadataSyncLocation defined in the entity's SAML metadata, e.g.,
   /idp/profile/SAML2/DAME:

         GET /idp/profile/SAML2/DAME?action=fetchmetadata
            ?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fsp.example.com%2FSSO HTTP/1.x
         Host: idp.example.net

         GET SSO/DAME?action=fetchmetadata
            ?entityID=https%3A%2F%2Fidp.example.net%2Fidp%2FSAMLidp
         Host: sp.example.com

   The entities download the metadata from T using, e.g., SAML Profile
   for Metadata Query Protocol [I-D.young-md-query-saml].  Only I's
   messages to download S's metadata are presented here, S's messages
   are equivalent:

         GET /metadataservice/entities/https%3A%2F%2Fsp.example.com%2F
         SSO HTTP/1.x
         Host: ttp.example.org
         Accept: application/samlmetadata+xml

         HTTP/1.x 200 OK
         Content-Type: application/samlmetadata+xml
         <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <EntityDescriptor entityID="https://sp.example.com/SSO"
         xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:metadata">
         ...

   T sends a request to I and S in order to receive the status of the
   integration:

         GET /metadataservice/DAME?action=add&status=status HTTP/1.x

   I answeres with:

         HTTP/1.x 200 OK

   After successful completion T forwards S's authentication request to
   I:

          GET /idp/profile/SAML2/Redirect/SSO
             ?SAMLRequest=fZHNTsMwEIRfJf.....
             &RelayState=target HTTP/1.x
          Host: idp.example.net

   I answers to S's AssertionConsumerServiceURL with a SAML Response:

          POST /SSO/SAML2/POST HTTP/1.x
             POSTDATA
             ...

   Receiving the SAMLResponse, S redirects U to the requested resource:

          HTTP/1.x 302 Found
          ...
          Location: sp.example.com/secure
          ...

          GET /secure HTTP/1.x
             Cookie...

          HTTP/1.x 200 OK

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Integrity

   As SAML metadata contains information necessary for the secure
   operation of interacting services, it is strongly RECOMMENDED that a
   mechanism for integrity checking is provided to clients.  This MAY
   include the use of SSL/TLS at the transport layer, digital signatures
   present within the metadata document, or any other such mechanism.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the integrity checking mechanism provided by a
   responder is a digital signature embedded in the returned metadata
   document, as defined by [OASIS.saml-metadata-2.0-os] section 3:

   - SHOULD use an RSA key pair whose modulus is no less than 2048 bits
   in length.

   - SHOULD NOT use the SHA-1 cryptographic hash algorithm as a digest
   algorithm.

   - MUST NOT use the MD5 cryptographic hash algorithm as a digest
   algorithm.

   - SHOULD otherwise follow current cryptographic best practices in
   algorithm selection.

5.2.  Confidentiality

   In many cases service metadata is public information and therefore
   confidentiality SHOULD NOT be required.  In those cases, where such
   functionality is required, it is RECOMMENDED that both the requester
   and responder support SSL/TLS.  Other mechanisms, such as XML
   encryption, MAY also be supported for privacy concerns.

5.3.  Inappropriate Usage

   This protocol mandates the authentication of users before any trust
   between SP and IDP is technically established.  Although this
   requires a further step for users, it protects against inappropriate
   usage of the user-initiated trust establishment process.  An example
   of inappropriate usage is triggering the metadata exchange for an
   IDP, where the user has no account.  Therefore, the user MUST be
   authenticated before the metadata is exchanged.

5.4.  Trust

   This protocol enables the user to trigger the SAML metadata exchange
   between two entities and establish the bi-directional technical trust
   relationship.  This is a prerequisite of the subsequent exchange of
   user information.

   For entities, which require a higher level of trust, it is
   RECOMMENDED to make use of one ore more additional mechanisms, e.g.,
   the usage of flags in metadata, implementation depending mechanisms
   in order to secure sensitive information, or to take organizational
   measures, such as requiring written contracts between SPs and IDPs.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
