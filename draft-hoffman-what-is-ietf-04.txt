                           Defining the IETF

Status of this memo

This document is an Internet-Draft and is in full conformance with all
provisions of Section 10 of RFC2026.

Internet-Drafts are working documents of the Internet Engineering Task
Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups.  Note that other
groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts.

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months
and may be updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any
time.  It is inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference
material or to cite them other than as "work in progress."

     The list of current Internet-Drafts can be accessed at

1. Introduction

Many RFCs refer to "the IETF". Many important IETF documents speak of
the IETF as if it were an already-defined entity. However, no IETF
document correctly defines what the IETF is. This document gives a
more concrete definition of "the IETF" as it understood today.

2. Defining the IETF

BCP 9 ("The Internet Standards Process -- Revision 3", RFC 2026) [BCP
9], the primary document that describes the Internet standards process,
never defines the IETF. As described in BCP 11 ("The Organizations
Involved in the IETF Standards Process", RFC 2028) [BCP 11], the
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open gobal community of
network designers, operators, vendors and researchers producing
technical specifications for the evolution of the Internet architecture
and the smooth operation of the Internet.

It is important to note that the IETF is not a corporation: it is an
unincorporated, freestanding organization. The IETF is partially
supported by the Internet Society (ISOC). ISOC is a US-based non-profit
membership corporation with thousands of individual and corporate
members throughout the world who pay membership fees to join. The
Internet Society provides many services to the IETF, including insurance
and some financial and logistical support.

As described in BCP 11, Internet standardization is an organized
activity of the ISOC, with the ISOC Board of Trustees being responsible
for ratifying the procedures and rules of the Internet standards
process.  However, the IETF is not a formal subset of ISOC; for
example, one does not have to join ISOC to be a member of the IETF.

There is no board of directors for the IETF, no formally signed bylaws,
no treasurer, and so on. The structure of the IETF (its leadership, its
working groups, the definition of IETF membership, and so on) are
described in detail in BCP 11.

Thus, when RFCs say "the IETF", they are describing the group that acts
in accordance with BCP 9 and BCP 11.

3. Security Considerations

All IETF protocols must describe the security aspects of the environment
in which they will be used. Also, the IETF has a Security Area which
discusses the security aspects of IETF protocols. However, descriptive
documents such as this one do not affect the security of the Internet.
