          Recommendation on Stable IPv6 Interface Identifiers
                    draft-ietf-6man-default-iids-07

Abstract

   The IPv6 addressing architecture defines Modified EUI-64 format
   Interface Identifiers, and the existing IPv6 over various link-layers
   specify how such identifiers are derived from the underlying link-
   layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC address) when employing IPv6
   Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC).  The security and
   privacy implications of embedding link-layer addresses in the
   Interface Identifier have been known and understood for some time
   now, and some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from
   such schemes to mitigate these issues.  This document changes the
   recommended default Interface Identifier generation scheme for SLAAC
   to that specified in RFC7217, and recommends against embedding link-
   layer addresses in IPv6 Interface Identifiers.  It formally updates
   RFC2464, RFC2467, RFC2470, RFC2491, RFC2492, RFC2497, RFC2590,
   RFC3146, RFC3572, RFC4291, RFC4338, RFC4391, RFC4944, RFC5072, and
   RFC5121, which require IPv6 Interface Identifiers to be derived from
   the underlying link-layer address.  Additionally, this document
   provides advice about the generation of Interface Identifiers with
   other address configuration mechanisms, such as Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) and manual configuration.

1.  Introduction

   [RFC4862] specifies Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC) for
   IPv6 [RFC2460], which typically results in hosts configuring one or
   more "stable" addresses composed of a network prefix advertised by a
   local router, and an Interface Identifier (IID) [RFC4291] that
   typically embeds a link-layer address (e.g., an IEEE LAN MAC
   address).

   In some network technologies and adaptation layers, the use of an IID
   based on a link-layer address may offer some advantages.  For

Internet-Draft            Default Interface-IDs              August 2015


   example, the IP-over-IEEE802.15.4 standard in [RFC6775] allows for
   compression of IPv6 addresses when the IID is based on the underlying
   link-layer address.

   The security and privacy implications of embedding a link-layer
   address in an IPv6 IID have been known for some time now, and are
   discussed in great detail in
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy]; they include:

   o  Network activity correlation

   o  Location tracking

   o  Address scanning

   o  Device-specific vulnerability exploitation

   Some popular IPv6 implementations have already deviated from the
   traditional stable IID generation scheme to mitigate the
   aforementioned security and privacy implications [Microsoft].

   As a result of the aforementioned issues, this document recommends
   the implementation of an alternative scheme ([RFC7217]) as the
   default stable IID generation scheme for SLAAC, such that the
   aforementioned issues are mitigated.

   NOTE: [RFC4291] defines the "Modified EUI-64 format" for IIDs.
   Appendix A of [RFC4291] then describes how to transform an IEEE
   EUI-64 identifier, or an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC address from which an
   EUI-64 identifier is derived, into an IID in the Modified EUI-64
   format.

   Finally this document provides advice about the generation of
   Interface Identifiers with other address configuration mechanisms,
   such as Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) and
   manual configuration.

2.  Terminology

   Stable address:
      An address that does not vary over time within the same network
      (as defined in [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy]).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

3.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers with SLAAC

   Link layers MUST define a mechanism that provides mitigation of the
   security and privacy implications discussed in Section 1.  Nodes
   SHOULD implement and employ [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating stable IPv6 addresses with SLAAC.  A link layer MAY also
   define a mechanism that is more efficient and does not address the
   security and privacy considerations discussed in Section 1.  The
   choice of whether to enable privacy or not SHOULD be configurable in
   such a case.

   By default, nodes SHOULD NOT employ IPv6 address generation schemes
   that embed the underlying link-layer address in the IID.  In
   particular, this document RECOMMENDS that nodes do not generate IIDs
   with the schemes specified in [RFC2464], [RFC2467], [RFC2470],
   [RFC2491], [RFC2492], [RFC2497], [RFC2590], [RFC3146], [RFC3572],
   [RFC4338], [RFC4391], [RFC4944], [RFC5121], and [RFC5072], and
   updates these documents with this recommendation.

   Some link-layers support locally assigned link-layer addresses
   [IEEE-802], such as [IEEE-802.3] and [IEEE-802.11], or random
   addresses [BLUETOOTH].  Where IPv6 IIDs are to be derived from link-
   layer addresses, it is RECOMMENDED that the random addresses
   supported by the link-layer are used, or that pseudo-random locally
   assigned link-layer addresses are generated, assigned and used.

   Future specifications SHOULD NOT specify IPv6 address generation
   schemes that embed the underlying link-layer address in the IID.  In
   some cases, embedding the link-layer address in the IID may reduce
   resource requirements such as energy, bandwidth and number of frames
   to carry a given IPv6 packet by facilitating header compression in
   constrained devices.  In such cases, future specifications MAY
   include IPv6 address generation schemes that embed the link-layer
   address in the IID, but MUST also specify an alternative IPv6 address
   generation scheme that provides mitigation of the security and
   privacy implications discussed in Section 1.

4.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers with DHCPv6

   By default, DHCPv6 server implementations SHOULD NOT generate
   predictable IPv6 addresses (such as IPv6 addresses where the IIDs are
   consecutive small numbers).  [I-D.ietf-dhc-stable-privacy-addresses]
   specifies one possible algorithm that could be employed to comply
   with this requirement.  Another possible algorithm would be to select
   a pseudo-random value chosen from a discrete uniform distribution,
   while avoiding the reserved IPv6 Interface Identifiers [RFC5453]
   [IANA-RESERVED-IID].

5.  Generation of IPv6 Interface Identifiers with Manual Configuration

   Network administrators should be aware of the security implications
   of predictable Interface Identifiers
   [I-D.ietf-6man-ipv6-address-generation-privacy], and avoid the use of
   predictable addresses when the aforementioned issues are of concern.

6.  Future Work

   At the time of this writing, the mechanisms specified in the
   following documents might require updates to be fully compatible with
   the recommendations in this document:

   o  RFC 6282 [RFC6282]

   o  RFC 4944 [RFC4944]

   o  RFC 6775 [RFC6775]

   Future revisions or updates of these documents should take the issues
   of privacy and security mentioned in Section 1 and explain any design
   and engineering considerations that lead to the use of IIDs based on
   a node's link-layer address.

7.  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document recommends [RFC7217] as the default scheme for
   generating IPv6 stable addresses with SLAAC, such that the security
   and privacy issues of IIDs that embed link-layer addresses are
   mitigated.
