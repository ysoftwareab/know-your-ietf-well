Internet Draft  TCP/IP based TML for ForCES protocol  July 2005 
 
    
   The following definitions are taken from [3], [5] 
    
   ForCES Protocol - While there may be multiple protocols used within 
   the overall ForCES architecture, the term "ForCES protocol" refers 
   only to the protocol used at the Fp reference point in the ForCES 
   Framework in RFC3746 [RFC3746].  This protocol does not apply to 
   CE-to-CE communication, FE-to-FE communication, or to communication 
   between FE and CE managers.  Basically, the ForCES protocol works in 
   a master-slave mode in which FEs are slaves and CEs are masters. 
    
    
   ForCES Protocol Layer (ForCES PL) -- A layer in ForCES protocol 
   architecture that defines the ForCES protocol messages, the protocol 
   state transfer scheme, as well as the ForCES protocol architecture 
   itself (including requirements of ForCES TML (see below)). 
   Specifications of ForCES PL are defined by this document. 
    
   ForCES Protocol Transport Mapping Layer (ForCES TML) -- A layer in 
   ForCES protocol architecture that specifically addresses the 
   protocol message transportation issues, such as how the protocol 
   messages are mapped to different transport media (like TCP, IP, ATM, 
   Ethernet, etc), and how to achieve and implement reliability, 
   multicast, ordering, etc.  This document defines a TCP/IP based 
   ForCES TML. 
         
 
2.   Introduction 
     
   The ForCES (Forwarding and Control Element Separation) working group 
   in the IETF is defining the architecture and protocol for separation 
   of control and forwarding elements in network elements such as 
   routers.  [3],  [4]  define  both  architectural  and  protocol 
   requirements for the communication between CE and FE. The ForCES 
   protocol layer [7] describes the protocol specification. It is 
   envisioned that the ForCES protocol would be independent of the 
   interconnect technology between the CE and FE and can run over 
   multiple  transport  technologies  and  protocol.  Thus  a  Transport 
   Mapping Layer (TML) has been defined in the protocol framework that 
   will  take  care  of  mapping  the  protocol  messages  to  specific 
   transports. This document defines the TCP/IP based TML for the 
   ForCES protocol layer. It also addresses all the requirements for 
   the TML including security, reliability, etc.

   The reader is referred to the Framework document [4], and in 
   particular sections 3 and 4, for architectural overview and where 
   and how the ForCES protocol fits in.  There may be some content 
   overlap between the ForCES protocol draft [7] and this section in 
   order to provide clarity. 
    
   The ForCES protocol constitutes two pieces: the PL and TML layer. 
   This is depicted in Figure 1 below.

                          Figure 1: ForCES Interface 
    
   The PL layer is in fact the ForCES protocol.  Its semantics and 
   message layout are defined in [7].  The TML Layer is necessary to 
   connect two ForCES PL layers as shown in Figure 1 above. 
    
   Both the PL and TML layers are standardized by the IETF.  While only 
   one PL layer is defined, different TMLs are expected to be 
   standardized.  To interoperate the TML layer at the CE and FE are 
   expected to be of the same definition. 
    
   On transmit, the PL layer delivers its messages to the TML layer. 
   The TML layer delivers the message to the destination TML layer(s). 
   On reception, the TML delivers the message to its destination PL 
   layer(s).

3.1.1.The PL layer 
    
   The PL is common to all implementations of ForCES and is 
   standardized by the IETF [7].  The PL layer is responsible for 
   associating an FE or CE to an NE.  It is also responsible for 
   tearing down such associations.  An FE uses the PL layer to throw 
   various subscribed-to events to the CE PL layer as well as respond 
   to various status requests issued from the CE PL.  The CE configures 
   both the FE and associated LFBs attributes using the PL layer.  In 
   addition the CE may send various requests to the FE to activate or 
   deactivate it, reconfigure it∆s HA parameterization, subscribe to 
   specific events etc.   
    
3.1.2.The TML layer 
    
   The TML layer is essentially responsible for transport of the PL 
   layer messages.  The TML is where the issues of how to achieve 
   transport level reliability, congestion control, multicast, 
   ordering, etc. are handled.  It is expected more than one TML will 
   be standardized.  The different TMLs each could implement things 
   differently based on capabilities of underlying media and transport. 
   However, since each TML is standardized, interoperability is 
   guaranteed as long as both endpoints support the same TML.  All 
   ForCES Protocol Layer implementations should be portable across all 
   TMLs, because all TMLs have the same top edge semantics. 
     
    
4.    TCP/IP TML Overview 
 
   [TBD: Update this section based on the protocol selected for the 
   data channel.] 
   The TCP/IP TML consists of two TCP connections between the CE and FE 
   over which the protocol messages are exchanged. One of the 
   connections is called the control channel, over which control 
   messages are exchanged, the other is called data channel over which 
   external protocol packets, such as routing packets will be 
   exchanged. The TCP connections will use unique server port numbers 
   for each of the channels. In addition to this, this TML will provide 
   mechanisms to prioritize the messages over the different channels. 
    
   Some of the rationale for choosing this transport mechanism as well 
   as explanation of how it meets the TML requirements is explained 
   below. 
    
4.1.Rationale for using TCP/IP

Internet Draft  TCP/IP based TML for ForCES protocol  July 2005 
 
   TCP meets all the reliability requirements (no losses, no data 
   corruption, no re-ordering of data) for the ForCES protocol/TML and 
   also provides congestion control mechanism, which is important to 
   meet the scalability requirement. In addition, it helps with 
   interoperability since TCP is a well-understood, widely deployed 
   transport protocol. Using TCP also enables this TML and the protocol 
   to work seamlessly in single hop and multihop scenarios. 
    
4.2.Separate Control and Data channels 
    
   The ForCES NEs are subject to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks 
   [Requirements Section 7 #15]. A malicious system in the network can 
   flood a ForCES NE with bogus control packets such as spurious RIP or 
   OSPF packets in an attempt to disrupt the operation of and the 
   communication between the CEs and FEs. In order to protect against 
   this situation, the TML uses separate control and data channels for 
   communication between the CEs and FEs. Figure 2 below illustrates 
   the different communication channels between the CEs and the FEs. As 
   an example, the communication channels for support of High 
   Availability with redundant CEs are also included.  The setup of 
   these channels would be dependent on the High Availability model 
   used in the NE.

   The data channel carries the control protocol packets such as RIP, 
   OSPF messages as outlined in Requirements [3] Section 7 #10, which 
   are carried in ForCES Packet Redirect messages [7], between the CEs 
   and FEs. All the other ForCES messages, which are used for 
   configuration/capability exchanges, event notification, etc, are 
   carried over the control channel. The data channel is set up only 
   after the control channel is set up. By default, the data channel is 
   established on the CE control channel port number +1. 
    
   The reliability requirements for the data channel messages are 
   different from that of the control messages [Reqs] i.e. they don∆t 
   require strict reliability in terms of retransmission, etc. However 
   congestion control is important for the data channel because in case 
   of DoS attacks, if an unreliable transport such as UDP is used for 
   the data traffic, it can more easily overflow the physical 
   connection, overwhelming the control traffic with congestion. Thus 
   we need a transport protocol that provides congestion control but 
   does not necessarily provide full reliability. Datagram Congestion 
   Control Protocol (DCCP) [11], which is currently being defined, is a 
   transport protocol that exactly meets this requirement. However 
   since it is currently not an IETF standard RFC, and the authors are 
   unaware of any existing implementations, this TML uses TCP as 
   transport protocol for the data channel (for IP interconnect). TCP 
   provides the congestion control mechanism required for the data 
   channel and its wide deployment eases interoperability. 
 
 
4.3.Reliability 
    
   TCP provides the reliability (no losses, no data corruption, no re-
   ordering of data) required for ForCES protocol control messages.

Internet Draft  TCP/IP based TML for ForCES protocol  July 2005 
 
4.4.Congestion Control 
    
   TCP provides congestion control needed to satisfy this requirement. 
    
4.5.Security 
    
   This TML uses TLS [8] to provide security in insecure environments. 
   Please see section 7 on security considerations for more details. 
   [TBD: Update based on IPSec/TLS decision.] 
    
4.6.Addressing 
    
   This TML uses addressing provided by IP layer. For unicast 
   addressing/delivery, it uses the TCP connection between the CE and 
   FE for control messaging. For multicast/broadcast 
   addressing/delivery of control messages, this TML uses multiple TCP 
   connections between the CE and FEs. 
    
   Additionally, the TML layer maintains the mapping between the PL 
   layer addresses and the channel descriptors assigned by the TML 
   layer.  The PL layer is unaware of these descriptors; the PL layer 
   only uses the PL layer addresses for all communication with the TML 
   layer. 
    
   [TBD: Add any information on addressing for data channel.] 
    
4.7.Prioritization 
    
   This TML provides prioritization of messages sent over control 
   channel as compared to the data channel. This has also been found to 
   be useful in face of DoS attacks on the protocol. Additionally it 
   supports multiple levels of prioritization for control messages. The 
   scheduling algorithm used at the TML layer gives preferential 
   treatment to higher priority messages.  The scheduling algorithm 
   used in the TML layer is implementation dependent. 
    
4.8.HA Decisions 
    
   The TML layer supports heartbeat messages between peer TML layers to 
   indicate liveness of the entity generating it.  The frequency of the 
   heartbeat message may be specified at protocol initialization time. 
    
   [TBD: Remove this? Use liveliness message at TCP layer?  What about 
   for the data channel?  What if the protocol doesn∆t support such a 
   message?  If a heartbeat message is required at the TML layer for 
   the data channel, does that imply that TML messaging is required?  
   See updates to Section 4.9 and 5.]

   TML is responsible for keeping the control and data communication 
   channels up.  It however does not have the authority to decide which 
   CE to set up the channels with.  That is outside its control. 
    
   If a FE-CE communication channel goes down or connectivity is lost, 
   the following steps are taken by the TML layer: 
   - FE TML attempts to reestablish the communication channel 
   - If the FE TML is unable to reestablish the channel (after some 
     configured number of retries/timeout), it notifies the FE PL that 
     the channel is down. 
   - CE TML waits for the channel to be reestablished (since only the 
     FE can reestablish it) for some configured timeout prior to 
     notifying the CE PL that the channel is down. 
    
   TBD: Since the PL layer is unaware of the number of channels etc., 
   what if only one channel goes down, but the other is up?  The TML 
   layer notifies the PL layer of which channel (control/data) is down? 
    
   If an FE goes down and a standby FE exists for it, and it has 
   communication channels set up with the CE, the CE PL may start to 
   use the channels associated with the standby FE.  This is not within 
   the scope of TML itself, but falls in the scope of High 
   Availability. 
    
   TBD: If an FE goes down and a standby FE exists for it, but it does 
   not have communication channels set up with the CE, how should it be 
   notified to set up the channels?  This is not within the scope of 
   TML itself, but falls in the scope of High Availability.  Do we need 
   this mentioned here? 
    
4.9.Encapsulations Used 
    
   There is no further message encapsulation of control and data 
   messages done at the TML layer.  The PL generated control messages 
   are transported as is by the TML layer. The ForCES protocol control 
   messages are encapsulated with a TCP/IP header. [TBD: Encapsulation 
   of data messages is dependent on the protocol that will be used for 
   the data channel (TCP is only for the control channel). If DCCP is 
   used for the data channel, then a DCCP header will be added.] 
   
 
5.   TML Messaging 
    
   There is no TML layer messaging.  TML only transports messages from 
   the PL layer.

Internet Draft  TCP/IP based TML for ForCES protocol  July 2005 
 
   ForCES TML interfaces with an upper layer protocol, the PL Layer and 
   a lower layer protocol, TCP (in the case of TCP TML).  This section 
   defines the interface to the upper layer protocol.  This interface 
   should be used only as a guideline in implementing the API.  
   Additionally, although the current interface is defined mainly as a 
   synchronous interface, the interface may be implemented to be 
   asynchronous if desired. 
 
6.1.TML Service Interface 
    
 
6.1.1.TML Initialize  
    
   status tmlInit( 
     in  channelType, 
     in  initAttributes) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     channelType: control versus data channel 
     initAttributes: initialization parameters 
    
   Output Parameters: 
     none  
    
   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   tmlInit() enables establishment of communication channels on the 
   entity that this API is invoked.  Optionally specifies attributes if 
   any, for initialization. This call does not however result in the 
   setup of any channels.   
    
   ForCES Usage Model:  
   In the case of ForCES which follows a client-server model, this API 
   would be invoked on the CE, which functions as the server. It is 
   invoked once for every class of TML channels on a per channel type 
   basis (control channel versus data channel).  For example, say for 
   control messaging, the CE communicates with five FEs using TCP TML 
   and with another two FEs, using UDP TML.  tmlInit() will need to be 
   invoked twice, once for the TCP TML attributes and once for the UDP 
   TML attributes for the control channel setup with all of the FEs.  
   The same holds true for the data channel setup in the above case. 
    
   [TBD: TBD: Should tmlInit() be invoked by the PL Layer at all since 
   we have now said the PL Layer is oblivious of the number of 
   channels, their attributes etc.  Currently, we had specified that

   tmlInit() would specify the attributes for the channels to be setup.  
   It seems like due to the change in the connection setup model this 
   information should be fed to the TML Layer via some other means.   
   The CE functions as the server, so the server should be up and 
   running however prior to the clients (FEs) coming up and trying to 
   connect to the server (CE).  The other option is that the mechanism 
   to specify attributes for the channels is distinct from the process 
   that uses those attributes to start up the server.  In that case, 
   tmlInit() could be used mainly to start the server.] 
    
 
6.1.2.TML Channel Open 
    
   status tmlOpen( 
     in  elementId, 
     in  channelMode, 
     in  ctrlChannelAttributes, 
     in  dataChannelAttributes, 
     in  eventHandlerCallBack) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     elementId: Specific CE for which channel needs to be setup 
     channelMode: unicast versus multicast 
     ctrlChannelAttributes: control channel establishment parameters 
     dataChannelAttributes: data channel establishment parameters 
     eventHandlerCallback: Callback function to be invoked on event 
   generation 
    
   Output Parameters: 
     none  
    
   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   tmlOpen() results in one or more communication channels for control 
   and data messaging being established with the specified elementId. 
   It is up to the TML layer implementation whether to setup a single 
   channel for both control and data messaging or distinct channels for 
   each. The channel may be specified as unicast or multicast via 
   channelMode.  This call may either trigger the establishment of the 
   channel(s), or if the channel(s) are already established, it only 
   results in a registration for the channel(s).  In either case, if 
   successful, status is returned to indicate successful 
   creation/registration of the control and data channels.  No 
   descriptors are returned to the PL layer since the TML layer 
   maintains the mapping between the PL provided elementId and the

   descriptors it allocates. If this call triggers the establishment of 
   the control and data channels, the channels are established using 
   the ctrlChannelAttributes and dataChannelAttributes parameters 
   respectively, specified to the call.  Once the channel(s) are setup 
   (or if already setup prior to this call), the caller of this API is 
   also capable of receiving TML events via the specified event 
   handling callback function. If this call is invoked multiple times 
   on a channel that has already been opened and registered, a return 
   status of ALREADY_REGISTERED is returned, with no change to 
   registration.  
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   In the case of ForCES which follows a client-server model, this API 
   would be invoked on the FE by FE PL, which functions as the client. 
   On each FE, it is invoked once for both control and data channels 
   that the FE wishes to setup with the CE. 
    
   Notes: 
   In the case of TCP TML, since there is no inherent support for 
   multicast, regardless of the channelMode specified, the specified 
   channel would be setup as a unicast channel; however, the unicast 
   channel would be able to support pseudo multicast.  Hence, TCP TML 
   has no need to set up distinct channels for unicast and multicast 
   communication; they are both mapped to the same TCP connection. 
    
 
    
6.1.3. TML Channel Close 
    
   status tmlClose( 
     in  elementId, 
     in  mode) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     elementId: address of element with which communication channel is 
   to be terminated 
     mode: mode of operation for the close ˚ forced versus controlled 
    
   Output Parameters: 
     none  
    
   Returns: 
     status: SUCCESS 
             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   Tears down/terminates communication channels connecting to the 
   specified elementId.  This API closes both control and data channels

   (regardless of whether they are implemented as a single channel or 
   distinct channels in the TML layer); it is not possible to close 
   just one of them.   No further CE PL ˚ FE PL messaging is possible 
   after this.  If the mode is specified as controlled, current 
   messages that are pending in the TML layer shall be sent, but no new 
   messages shall be accepted by the TML layer on this channel.  In the 
   forced mode, messages pending in the TML layer shall be discarded.  
   Since the channel was terminated, a subsequent tmlOpen() will 
   trigger establishment of the channel. 
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   This API may be invoked by either the CE or the FE.  If the FE PL 
   invokes it, it specifies a CE ID for the elementId.  If the CE PL 
   invokes it, it specifies an FE ID for the elementId.  
    
6.1.4.TML Channel Write 
    
   status tmlWrite( 
     in  elementId, 
     in  msgType, 
     in  msg, 
     in  msgSize, 
     in  timeout, 
     out bytesWritten) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     elementId: address of element to be written to; may be a unicast, 
   multicast or broadcast address 
     msgType: control versus data message 
     msg: message to be sent 
     msgSize: size of message to be sent 
     timeout: specifies blocking or non-blocking write.  Value of -1 
   implies blocking write (wait forever), value of 0 implies non-
   blocking write 
      
   Output Parameters: 
     bytesWritten: number of bytes actually transmitted  
    
   Returns:

             Errors TBD 
    
   Synopsis:  
   Sends message to the address specified by elementId.  If the 
   specified elementId is associated with a multicast group, the 
   message will be sent to all members of the group.  Similarly, if the 
   elementId specified is a broadcast address, the message is sent to 
   all elements associated with the broadcast address.  The msgType

   parameter is used to specify whether the message is a control or 
   data type of message.  Based on the message type, the TML will send 
   the message over the appropriate channel.  The TML layer uses the 
   address specified by elementId and the msgType to map to the 
   appropriate channel to be used for sending the message.  The message 
   is queued in the appropriate queue for transmission.  Once this call 
   returns, the message buffer may be freed.  If TML∆s message queues 
   are full, the timeout will be used to determine how long to wait 
   prior to returning; if the specified timeout expires, and no message 
   buffer becomes available, the API returns with an error. 
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   This API may be invoked by either the FE PL or the CE PL.  If the FE 
   PL invokes it, it specifies a CE ID for the elementId.  If the CE PL 
   invokes it, it specifies an (unicast/multicast/broadcast) FE ID for 
   the elementId.   
   In the case of TCP TML since there is a single channel used for 
   unicast, multicast and broadcast messaging, the same channel is used 
   for sending messages regardless of the address specified.  In other 
   cases where there are distinct channels for unicast versus 
   multicast, the channel to be written to will differ based on the 
   address specified. 
    
    
6.1.5.TML Channel Read 
    
   status tmlRead( 
     in  elementId, 
     in  msgType, 
     in  msgBuf, 
     in  timeout, 
     out bytesRead) 
    
   Input Parameters:  
     elementId: address of element to be read from; may be a unicast, 
   multicast or broadcast address 
     msgType: control versus data message 
     msgBuf: buffer into which message is to be read 
     timeout: specifies blocking or non-blocking read.  Value of -1 
   implies blocking read (wait forever), value of 0 implies non-
   blocking read

     bytesRead: number of bytes actually read

   Synopsis:  
   Reads message from the specified address. The msgType parameter is 
   used to specify whether the message to be read is a control or data 
   type of message.  The TML layer uses the address specified by 
   elementId and the msgType to map to the appropriate channel to be 
   used for reading the message.  Once the message is copied into 
   msgBuf specified by the call, the TML message buffer may be freed.  
   If TML∆s message queues are empty (no message is available), the 
   timeout will be used to determine how long to wait prior to 
   returning; if the specified timeout expires, and no message becomes 
   available, the API returns with an error. 
   If a non-blocking read is executed, the caller of the API is 
   notified via an upcall when a message becomes available. 
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   This API may be invoked by either the CE or the FE.  If the FE PL 
   invokes it, it specifies a CE ID for the elementId.  If the CE PL 
   invokes it, it specifies an (unicast/multicast/broadcast) FE ID for 
   the elementId.  
    
   In the case of TCP TML since there is a single channel used for 
   unicast, multicast and broadcast messaging, the same channel is used 
   for reading messages regardless of the address specified.  In other 
   cases where there are distinct channels for unicast versus

   Joins the multicast group specified by groupId as leaf node in the 
   group. Once a member of this group, the entity calling this API will 
   be capable of receiving messages addressed to this multicast group.  
   The TML layer on each end (CE/FE) maintains the mapping between the 
   PL layer multicast address and the descriptors.  The TML layer on 
   the element which is the root of the multicast updates the set of 
   elements that are members of the group specified by groupId. 
    
   ForCES Usage Model: 
   This API would be invoked on both the CE and the FE.  Initially, the 
   intent is to only support FE multicast.  In such a case. on the FE 
   the API is invoked once the PL layer on the FE receives a request 
   from the PL layer on the CE to join a specified multicast group. On 
   the CE it is invoked after the FE has successfully joined the 
   multicast group.

6.2.Protocol Initialization and Shutdown Model 
    
   In order for the peer PL Layers to communicate, the control and data 
   channels must be setup.  This section defines a model for the setup 
   of the channels, using the TML interface defined above. In this 
   model, the peer TML Layers may establish the control and data 
   channels between the FE and the CE without the involvement of the PL 
   Layers, or if desired, the PL Layer may trigger the setup of the 
   channels; this is left as an implementation decision.  Both modes 
   may also be supported within an implementation.   
    
6.2.1.Protocol Initialization 
    
   The control channel must be established between the FE TML and the 
   CE TML for establishment of association to proceed.  This channel 
   will be used for messages related to the association setup and 
   capability query.  The data channel must be established no later 
   than the response from the FE to the CE Topology query message.  The 
   following are the significant aspects associated with channel setup: 
   - A single call by the PL layer sets up the communication channels 
     for both control and data messaging to a specific FE.  The call 
     specifies Unicast CE Id and attributes for control and data 
     channels. 
   - It is up to the TML layer whether to set up a single channel for 
     both control and data or distinct channels for control and data 
   - TML sets up the appropriate channels and allocates required 
     descriptors for the channels.  TML layer maintains a mapping 
     between the Unicast FE/CE Id and the channel descriptors and 
     channel type (control versus data) it creates. 
   - There is no need for channel descriptors to be returned to the PL 
     layer at either the FE or the CE.  PL Layer only uses the Unicast 
     FE/CE Id for read/write calls and specifies the type of message 
     (control versus data) to be read/written. 
   - If only one of the channels is setup successfully, the TML layer 
     will have to return appropriate status that specifies which 
     channel is setup successfully and which isn∆t. 
    
   Figure 4 illustrates the initialization model where the PL layer via 
   an interface provided by the TML Layer, triggers the setup of the 
   control and data channels.

6.2.2.Protocol Shutdown 
 
The control channel teardown must occur only after the association 
teardown has occurred.  The data channel teardown may occur no earlier 
than the association teardown. 
 
The PL Layer may shutdown control and data channels via invocation of 
the tmlClose() API.  When the PL layer shuts down the channels, the 
channels are torn down; hence ForCES messaging between the CE and FE is 
no longer possible over those channels.  A tmlClose() results in both 
control and data channels (regardless of whether they are implemented 
as a single channel or distinct channels in the TML layer) being 
shutdown; it is not possible to close just one of them. A subsequent 
tmlOpen() triggers establishment of the channel.  The channel(s) may be 
shutdown by either the FE or the CE. If an FE initiates the shutdown, 
it specifies the CE Id associated with the channel(s) to be shutdown. 
If a CE initiates the shutdown, it specifies the FE Id associated with 
the channel(s) to be shutdown.  A channel shutdown by the FE is 
illustrated in Figure 5 and a channel shutdown by the CE is illustrated 
in Figure 6.

6.3.Multicast Model 
    
   The TML layer provides support for multicast.  In the ForCES model, 
   support is required to multicast to the FEs from a CE; in this case, 
   the CE is the source or root of the multicast and the FEs are the 
   leaves. 
    
   Support for multicast requires that a channel for supporting 
   multicast be opened between an FE and the CE.  In the case of TCP 
   TML, the same channel is used for both unicast and multicast 
   messaging since multicast mode is simulated using unicast channels 
   in this case. Once the channel is open, a CE may request FEs to join 
   and leave specified multicast groups.  Multicast support is CE-
   initiated.  FEs can join a multicast group only if the CE requests 
   them to join the group.  TML maintains mapping between PL layer IDs 
   and channel descriptors for multicast.  The following is the 
   significant steps for adding or removing members from a multicast 
   group: 
 
   - CE PL communicates with FE PL for requesting the FE to join or 
     leave a multicast group. 
   - FE PL informs FE TML regarding the join or leave request.  
   - FE TML updates the multicast group information.  It updates the 
     mapping between the FE Multicast Id and the channel descriptor to 
     be used for multicast for that FE.  This mapping may be from 
     [Multicast FE Id] . [FE Id] . [Channel descriptor] or directly

     from [Multicast FE Id] . [Channel descriptor].  This is 
     implementation dependent. 
   - FE PL responds to CE PL informing it of the status of the join or 
     leave request. 
   - If the join or leave request was successful, CE PL informs CETML 
     regarding the update to the multicast group membership. 
   - CE TML updates the multicast group membership.  It updates the 
     mapping between the FE Multicast Id and the set of channel 
     descriptors to be used for multicast to the FEs that are members 
     of this group.  This mapping may be from [Multicast FE Id] . [Set 
     of FE Ids] . [Set of channel descriptors] or directly from 
     [Multicast FE Id] . [Set of channel descriptors].  This is 
     implementation dependent. 
   - There is no need for any descriptors to be returned to the PL 
     layer at either the FE or the CE.  PL Layer only uses the 
     Multicast FE Id for write calls and specifies the type of message 
     (control versus data) to be written. 
    
   A tmlWrite() on a unicast FE Id results in a unicast message being 
   sent to the FE associated with the channel.  A tmlWrite() on a 
   multicast FE Id results in multicast messaging. Figures 7 and 8 
   illustrate multicast scenarios with 2 FEs, FE1 and FE2.  In Figure 
   7, the CE requests FE1 to join a multicast group.  Although not 
   shown as a separate figure, if FE2 were to join the same group, the 
   join procedure would be the same as in Figure 7; it would result in 
   the multicast group membership being updated at the TML layer on the 
   CE to include FE2 in the group.  In Figure 8, the CE requests FE1 to 
   leave the multicast group, thus resulting in only FE2 being a member 
   of the multicast group.

6.4.Broadcast Model 
 
   The TML layer provides support for broadcast.  In the ForCES model, 
   support is required to broadcast to the FEs from a CE.  The 
   broadcast model is just a special case of multicast, where all FEs 
   are included.  TBD: Is there anything else to be added/discussed 
   here.  Join/Leave messaging also used for broadcast?  ForCES draft 
   also talks of CE broadcast and NE broadcast. 
    
 
7.   Security Considerations  
    
   If the CE or FE are in a single box and network operator is running 
   under a secured environment then it is up to the network 
   administrator to turn off all the security functions. This is 
   configured during the pre-association phase of the protocol.  
    
   When the CEs, FEs are running over IP networks or in an insecure 
   environment, this TML uses TLS [8] to provide security. The security

Internet Draft  TCP/IP based TML for ForCES protocol  July 2005 
 
   association between the CEs and FEs MUST be established before any 
   ForCES protocol messages are exchanged between the CEs and FEs.  
    
    
7.1.TLS Usage for this TML 
   [TBD: Update based on inclusion of IPSec for security.] 
    
   This section is applicable for CE or FE endpoints that use the TML 
   with TLS [8] to secure communication. 
    
   Since CE is master and FEs are slaves, the FEs are TLS clients and 
   CEs are TLS server. The endpoints that implement TLS MUST perform 
   mutual authentication during TLS session establishment process. CE 
   must request certificate from FE and FE needs to pass the requested 
   information.  
    
   We recommend ÙTLS-RSA-with-AES-128-CBC-SHAˆ cipher suite, but CE or 
   FE may negotiate other TLS cipher suites. TLS must be used for all 
   control channel messages. TLS is optional for the data channel since 
   data channel packets are not encrypted externally to the NE.  
    
   This TML uses TLS to provide security when the NE is in an insecure 
   environment. This is because IPsec provides less flexibility when 
   configuring trust anchors since it is transparent to the application 
   and use of Port identifiers is prohibited within IKE Phase 1. This 
   provides restriction for IPsec to configure trust anchors for each 
   application separately and policy configuration is common for all 
   applications. 
    
 
8.   IANA Considerations 
  
   The TCP/IP TML needs to have a one well-defined TCP port number,
