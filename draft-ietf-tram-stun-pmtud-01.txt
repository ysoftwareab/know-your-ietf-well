Internet-Draft                 STUN PMTUD                   January 2016


1.  Introduction

   The Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery specification [RFC4821]
   describes a method to discover the path MTU but does not describe a
   practical protocol to do so with UDP.

   This document only describes how probing mechanisms are implemented
   with Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN).  The algorithm to
   find the path MTU is described in [RFC4821].

   The STUN usage defined in this document for Path MTU Discovery
   (PMTUD) between a client and a server simplifies troubleshooting and
   has multiple applications across a wide variety of technologies.

   Additional network characteristics like the network path (using the
   STUN Traceroute mechanism described in
   [I-D.martinsen-tram-stuntrace]) and bandwidth availability (using the
   mechanism described in [I-D.martinsen-tram-turnbandwidthprobe]) can
   be discovered using complementary techniques.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].  When these
   words are not in ALL CAPS (such as "must" or "Must"), they have their
   usual English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key
   words.

3.  Probing Mechanisms

   A client MUST NOT send a probe if it does not have knowledge that the
   server supports this specification.  This is done by an external
   mechanism specific to each UDP protocol.  Section 6 describes some of
   this mechanisms.

   The probe mechanism is used to discover the path MTU in one direction
   only, from the client to the server.

   Two probing mechanisms are described, a simple probing mechanism and
   a more complete mechanism that can converge quicker.

   The simple probing mechanism is implemented by sending a Probe
   Request with a PADDING [RFC5780] attribute and the DF bit set over
   UDP.  A router on the path to the server can reject this request with
   an ICMP message or drop it.  The client SHOULD cease retransmissions
   after 3 missing responses.

Internet-Draft                 STUN PMTUD                   January 2016


   The complete probing mechanism is implemented by sending one or more
   Probe Indication with a PADDING attribute and the DF bit set over UDP
   then a Report Request to the same server.  A router on the path to
   the server can reject this indication with an ICMP message or drop
   it.  The server keeps a time ordered list of identifiers of all
   packets received (including retransmitted packets) and sends this
   list back to the client in the Report Response.  The client analyzes
   this list to find which packets were not received.  Because UDP
   packets does not contain an identifier, the complete probing
   mechanism needs a way to identify each packet received.  While there
   are other possible packet identification schemes, this document
   describes two different ways to identify a specific packet.

   In the first packet identifier mechanism, the server computes a
   checksum over each packet received and sends back to the sender the
   ordered list of checksums.  The client compares this list to its own
   list of checksums.

   In the second packet identifier mechanism, the client adds a
   sequential number in front of each UDP packet sent.  The server sends
   back the ordered list of sequential numbers received that the client
   compares to its own list

4.  Simple Probing Mechanism

4.1.  Sending a Probe Request

   A client forms a Probe Request by following the rules in Section 7.1
   of [RFC5389].  No authentication method is used.  The client adds a
   PADDING [RFC5780] attribute with a length that, when added to the IP
   and UDP headers and the other STUN components, is equal to the
   Selected Probe Size, as defined in [RFC4821] section 7.3.  The client
   MUST add the FINGERPRINT attribute.

   Then the client sends the Probe Request to the server over UDP with
   the DF bit set.  The client SHOULD stop retransmitting after 3
   missing responses.

4.2.  Receiving a Probe Request

   A server receiving a Probe Request MUST process it as specified in
   [RFC5389].  The server MUST NOT challenge the client.

   The server then creates a Probe Response.  The server MUST add the
   FINGERPRINT attribute.  The server then sends the response to the
   client.

4.3.  Receiving a Probe Response

   A client receiving a Probe Response MUST process it as specified in
   [RFC5389].  If a response is received this is interpreted as a Probe
   Success as defined in [RFC4821] section 7.6.1.  If an ICMP packet
   "Fragmentation needed" is received then this is interpreted as a
   Probe Failure as defined in [RFC4821] section 7.6.2.  If the Probe
   transactions fails in timeout, then this is interpreted as a Probe
   Inconclusive as defined in [RFC4821] section 7.6.4.

5.  Complete Probing Mechanism

5.1.  Sending the Probe Indications and Report Request

   A client forms a Probe Indication by following the rules in [RFC5389]
   section 7.1.  The client adds to the Probe Indication a PADDING
   attribute with a size that, when added to the IP and UDP headers and
   the other STUN components, is equal to the Selected Probe Size, as
   defined in [RFC4821] section 7.3.  The client MUST add the
   FINGERPRINT attribute.

   Then the client sends the Probe Indication to the server over UDP
   with the DF bit set.

   Then the client forms a Report Request by following the rules in
   [RFC5389] section 7.1.  No authentication method is used.  The client
   MUST add the FINGERPRINT attribute.

   Then the client waits half the RTO if it is known or 50 milliseconds
   after sending the Probe Indication and sends the Report Request to
   the server over UDP.

5.2.  Receiving an ICMP packet

   If an ICMP packet "Fragmentation needed" is received then this is
   interpreted as a Probe Failure as defined in [RFC4821] section 7.5.

5.3.  Receiving a Probe Indication and Report Request

   A server supporting this specification and knowing that the client
   also supports it will keep the identifiers of all packets received in
   a list ordered by receiving time.  The same identifier can appear
   multiple times in the list because of retransmission.  The maximum
   size of this list is calculated so that when the list is added to the
   Report Response, the total size of the packet does not exceed the
   unknown path MTU as defined in [RFC5389] section 7.1.  Older
   identifiers are removed when new identifiers are added to a list
   already full.

   A server receiving a Report Request MUST process it as specified in
   [RFC5389].  The server MUST NOT challenge the client.

   The server creates a Report Response and adds an IDENTIFIERS
   attribute that contains the list of all identifiers received so far.
   The server MUST add the FINGERPRINT attribute.  The server then sends
   the response to the client.

5.4.  Receiving a Report Response

   A client receiving a Report Response processes it as specified in
   [RFC5389].  If the response IDENTIFIERS attribute contains the
   identifier of the Probe Indication, then this is interpreted as a
   Probe Success for this probe as defined in [RFC4821] Section 7.5.  If
   the Probe Indication identifier cannot be found in the Report
   Response, this is interpreted as a Probe Failure as defined in
   [RFC4821] Section 7.5.  If the Probe Indication identifier cannot be
   found in the Report Response but other packets identifier sent before
   or after the Probe Indication cannot also be found, this is
   interpreted as a Probe Inconclusive as defined in [RFC4821]
   Section 7.5.  If the Report Transaction fails in timeout, this is
   interpreted as a Full-Stop Timeout as defined in [RFC4821] Section 3.

5.5.  Using Checksum as Packet Identifiers

   When using checksum as packet identifiers, the client calculate the
   checksum for each packet sent over UDP and keep this checksum in an
   ordered list.  The server does the same thing and send back this list
   in the Report Response.

   It could have been possible to use the checksum generated in the UDP
   checksum for this, but this value is generally not accessible to
   applications.  Also sometimes the checksum is not calculated or off-
   loaded to the network card.

5.6.  Using Sequential Numbers as Packet Identifiers

   When using sequential numbers, a small header similar to the TURN
   ChannelData header is added in front of all non-STUN packets.  The
   sequential number is incremented for each packet sent.  The server
   collects the sequence number of the packets sent.

   The Channel Number is always 0xFFFF.

6.  Probe Support Discovery Mechanisms

6.1.  Implicit Mechanism

   An endpoint acting as a client for the STUN usage described in this
   specification MUST also act as a server for this STUN usage.  This
   means that a server receiving a probe can assumes that it can acts as
   a client to discover the path MTU to the IP address and port from
   which it received the probe.

6.2.  Probe Support Discovery with TURN

   A TURN client supporting this STUN usage will add a PMTUD-SUPPORTED
   attribute to the Allocate Request sent to the TURN server.  The TURN
   server can immediately start to send probes to the TURN client on
   reception of an Allocation Request with a PMTUD-SUPPORTED attribute.
   The TURN client will then use the Implicit Mechanism described above
   to send probes.

6.3.  Probe Support Discovery with ICE

   An ICE [RFC5245] client supporting this STUN usage will add a PMTUD-
   SUPPORTED attribute to the Binding Request sent during a connectivity
   check.  The ICE server can immediately start to send probes to the
   ICE client on reception of a Binding Request with a PMTUD-SUPPORTED
   attributed.  Local candidates receiving Binding Request with the
   PMTUD-SUPPORTED flag must not start PMTUD with the remote candidate
   if already done so.  The ICE client will then use the Implicit
   Mechanism described above to send probes.

7.  Security Considerations

   The PMTUD mechanism described in this document does not introduce any
   specific security considerations beyond those described in [RFC4821].

   The attack described in [RFC4821] applies equally to the mechanism
   described in this document.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This specification defines two new STUN method and two new STUN
   attributes.  IANA added these new protocol elements to the "STUN
   Parameters Registry" created by [RFC5389].

8.1.  New STUN Methods

   This section lists the codepoints for the new STUN methods defined in
   this specification.  See Sections Section 4 and Section 5 for the
   semantics of these new methods.

      0xXXX : Probe

      0xXXX : Report

8.2.  New STUN Attributes

   This document defines the IDENTIFIERS STUN attribute, described in
   Section 5.  IANA has allocated the comprehension-required codepoint
   0xXXXX for this attribute.

   This document also defines the PMTUD-SUPPORTED STUN attribute,
   described in Section 6.  IANA has allocated the comprehension-
   optional codepoint 0xXXXX for this attribute.
