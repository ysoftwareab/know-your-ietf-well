A YANG model to manage the optical interface parameters for an external
                      transponder in a WDM network
                  draft-dharini-ccamp-dwdm-if-yang-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a Yang model that translates the SNMP mib module
   defined in draft-galikunze-ccamp-dwdm-if-snmp-mib for managing single
   channel optical interface parameters of DWDM applications.  This
   model is to support the optical parameters specified in ITU-T G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2] and application identifiers specified in ITU-T G.874.1
   [ITU.G874.1] .  Note that G.874.1 encompasses vendor-specific codes,
   which if used would make the interface a single vendor IaDI and could
   still be managed.

   The Yang model defined in this memo can be used for Optical
   Parameters monitoring and/or configuration of the endpoints of the
   multi-vendor IaDI optical link.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a Yang model that translates the SNMP mib module
   defined in draft-galikunze-ccamp-dwdm-if-snmp-mib for managing single
   channel optical interface parameters of DWDM applications, using the
   approach specified in G.698.2.  This model is to support the optical
   parameters specified in ITU-T G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2], application
   identifiers specified in ITU-T G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1] and the Optical
   Power at Transmitter and Receiver side.  Note that G.874.1
   encompasses vendor-specific codes, which if used would make the
   interface a single vendor IaDI and could still be managed.`

   [Editor's note: In G.698.2 this corresponds to the optical path from
   point S to R; network media channel is also used and explained in
   draft-ietf-ccamp-flexi-grid-fwk-02]

   Management will be performed at the edges of the network media
   channel (i.e., at the transmitters and receivers attached to the S
   and R reference points respectively) for the relevant parameters
   specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2], G.798 [ITU.G798], G.874
   [ITU.G874], and the performance parameters specified in G.7710/Y.1701
   [ITU-T G.7710] and G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1].

   G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] is primarily intended for metro applications
   that include optical amplifiers.  Applications are defined in G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2] using optical interface parameters at the single-channel
   connection points between optical transmitters and the optical
   multiplexer, as well as between optical receivers and the optical
   demultiplexer in the DWDM system.  This Recommendation uses a
   methodology which does not explicitly specify the details of the
   optical network between reference point Ss and Rs, e.g., the passive
   and active elements or details of the design.  The Recommendation
   currently includes unidirectional DWDM applications at 2.5 and 10
   Gbit/s (with 100 GHz and 50 GHz channel frequency spacing).  Work is
   still under way for 40 and 100 Gbit/s interfaces.  There is
   possibility for extensions to a lower channel frequency spacing.
   This document specifically refers to the "application code" defined
   in the G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] and included in the Application
   Identifier defined in G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1] and G.872 [ITU.G872], plus
   a few optical parameters not included in the G.698.2 application code
   specification.

   This draft refers and supports the draft-kdkgall-ccamp-dwdm-if-mng-
   ctrl-fwk

   The building of a yang model describing the optical parameters
   defined in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2], and reflected in G.874.1
   [ITU.G874.1], allows the different vendors and operator to retrieve,

   provision and exchange information across the G.698.2 multi-vendor
   IaDI in a standardized way.  In addition to the parameters specified
   in ITU recommendations the Yang models support also the "vendor
   specifica application identifier", the Tx and Rx power at the Ss and
   Rs points and the channel frequency.

   The Yang Model, reporting the Optical parameters and their values,
   characterizes the features and the performances of the optical
   components and allow a reliable link design in case of multi vendor
   optical networks.

   Although RFC 3591 [RFC3591], which draft-galikunze-ccamp-DWDM-if-
   snmp-mib is extending, describes and defines the SNMP MIB of a number
   of key optical parameters, alarms and Performance Monitoring, as this
   RFC is over a decade old, it is primarily pre-OTN, and a more
   complete and up-to-date description of optical parameters and
   processes can be found in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations.  The
   same considerations can be applied to the RFC 4054 [RFC4054].

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   This memo specifies a Yang model for optical interfaces.

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] In
   the description of OIDs the convention: Set (S) Get (G) and Trap (T)
   conventions will describe the action allowed by the parameter.

     Application code Type:
      This parameter indicates the transceiver type of application code
     at Ss and Rs as defined in [ITU.G874.1], that is used by this
      interface Standard = 0, PROPRIETARY = 1

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this memo is designed to be accessed via
   the NETCONF protocol [RFC6241]. he lowest NETCONF layer is the secure
   transport layer and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is
   SSH [RFC6242].  The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides
   the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF protocol operation and
   content.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers a URI in the IETF XML registry [RFC3688].
   Following the format in [RFC3688], the following registration is
   requested to be made:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces:ietf-ext-xponder-
   wdm-if

   Registrant Contact: The IESG.

   XML: N/A, the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].

   This document registers a YANG module in the YANG Module Names
   registry [RFC6020].
