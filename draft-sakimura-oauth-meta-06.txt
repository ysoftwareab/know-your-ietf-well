                        OAuth Response Metadata
                      draft-sakimura-oauth-meta-06

Abstract

   This specification defines an extensible metadata that may be
   inserted into the OAuth 2.0 responses to assist the clients to
   process those responses.  It is expressed either as a link header, or
   query parameters.  It will allow the client to learn where the
   members in the response could be used, what is the characteristics of
   the payload is, how it should be processed, and so on.  Since they
   are just additional response header/query parameters, any client that
   does not understand this extension should not break and work normally
   while supporting clients can utilize the metadata to take the
   advantage of the extension.

1.  Introduction

   Although OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] has been known for its REST
   friendliness, OAuth itself is not RESTful, as it heavily relies on
   out-of-band information to drive the interactions.  This situation
   can be eased by hypertext-enabling the endpoint responses through the
   introduction of data structure that represents such hypertext and
   other metadata.

   Hyper-text enabling the OAuth responses has many advantages.  For
   example,

   o  The authorization server can assign different token endpoints
      depending on the authorization request and the user authorization.

   o  It is possible to tell the client which resource endpoint it
      should use.  This has a privacy advantage as well.  The location
      of the resource by itself may be a sensitive information as its
      location may reveal information about the resource owner.

   o  It is possible to give a hint on the processing of the payload.

   o  It will be resitant to Mix-up attack.

   o  It will be resitant to Code Phishing Attack.

   This specification defines methods to represent such metadata in the
   authorization and token responses.

1.1.  Requirements Notation and Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.2.  terminology

   This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization
   Code", "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant",
   "Authorization Server", "Client", "Client Authentication", "Protected
   Resource", "Refresh Token", and "Token Endpoint" defined by OAuth 2.0
   [RFC6749].

2.  Token Endpoint Response

   Token Endpoints that implements this specification returns the
   following link relation (rel) and the corresponding URI value as
   defined in [RFC5988] in the Access Token Response defined in
   [RFC6749].

   ruri  Resource URI.  The value of this parameter is the URI of the
      Resource Endpoint that the Access Token is supposed to be used at.
      If this value is present, the cleint MUST NOT send the Access
      Token to any other URI.

   turi  Token Endpoint URI.  The value of this parameter is the URI of
      the Token Endpoint that the Refresh Token can be sent to obtain a
      new Access Token.  If this value is present, then the client MUST
      NOT send the refresh token to any other places.

   Any other rels that are registered in Link Relation Type Registry
   defined in [RFC5988] registry can be used.

   Following is an example of an HTTPS response.

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Link: <https://example.com/userinfo>; rel="ruri",
    <https://example.com/payment-upon-trial-expiry>; rel="payments"
   Content-Type: application/JSON; charset=utf-8

   {
           "access_token":"aCeSsToKen"
   }

3.  Authorization Response

   While [RFC5988] defines a useful way of conveying link relations, it
   cannot be utilized for a redirect based communication such as the
   authorization response of OAuth 2.0.  This section defines a way to
   return a limited set of those link relations as query parameters so
   that it can be conveyed over the redirection.

   The authorization response of the implementation of this
   specification may return the following query parameter in the
   redirect URI.

   turi  Token Endpoint URI.  The value of this parameter is the URI of
      the Token Endpoint that the Authorization Code can be sent to
      obtain the Access Token.  If this parameter is specified, the
      client MUST check that the value of turi matches exactly with the
      pre-registered token endpoint URI of the Authorization Server that
      the session recoverd from the state variable points to.  The
      cleint MUST NOT send the code to any other URIs than the value of
      this parameter.

   ruri  Resource URI.  The value of this parameter is the URI of the
      Resource Endpoint that the Access Token can be used at.  If this
      parameter is specified, the cleint MUST NOT send the Access Token
      to any other URIs than the value of this parameter.

   As long as the link relation type string does not collide with the
   underlying protocol parameters, they can also be specified as a query
   parameter.  The value MUST be encoded in application/x-www-form-
   urlencoded.

   The following is an example of such resopnse.  Line breaks are for
   display purposes only.

   HTTP/1.1 302 Found
   Location: https://client.example.com/cb?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA
       &turi=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Ftoken
       &state=xyz

4.  IANA Considerations

4.1.  Link Type Registration

   Pursuant to [RFC5988], the following link type registrations [[will
   be]] registered by mail to link-relations@ietf.org.

   o  Relation Name: turi

   o  Description: An OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint specified in section 3.2
      of [RFC6749].

   o  Reference: This specification

   o  Relation Name: ruri

   o  Description: An OAuth 2.0 Resource Endpoint specified in section
      3.2 of [RFC6750].

   o  Reference: This specification

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Authorization Response Query Parameter Tampering by a Bad User

   The query response parameters may be tampered by the man-in-the-
   browser.  It can also be tampered by a malicious user.  In general,
   anything that comes via the browser/user-agent can be tainted and
   untrusted.

   This specification mandates the turi check so that tamparing of turi
   by the malicious user will be detected.  It does not mandate ruri
   check as the user can get the Access Token and send it to anywhere he
   wants anyways when it is returned to the browser.

   However, other parameters are not protected.  The Client MUST treat
   them tainted and implement its own check rules for each parameters.

   To solve this "Tampering by bad user", either HMAC(concat(params))
   need to be sent with them or have all of them inside the JWS.

7.  Document History

   -06

   o  Removed duri description from token response as it is not needed.

   o  Made the processing instruction more precise.

   o  Added RFC5988 defined link relation type in the example.

   o  Swaped the order of the authorization response and token response.
      Now, token response gets explained first so that the reader will
      grasp the basic concept according to RFC5988 and regards the
      authorization response extension as a mapping of RFC5988 into
      query parameter form.

   -05

   o  Factored out JSON Meta and now using query param and Web Linking.

   -04

   o  Date refresh.

   -03

   o  Date refresh.

   -02

   o  Added Mike Kelly as an author.

   o  xref fix.

   o  Introduced "operations" as in draft-ietf-scim-api-00#section-3.5.

   o  Updated the informative reference to HAL.

   o  Added description to OAuth Token Endpoint hrefs.

   o  Added content-type to the example.

   o  Added Area and Working Group.

   -01

   o  Some format changes, reference fix, and typo fixes.
