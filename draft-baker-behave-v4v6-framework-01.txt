Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


1.  Introduction

   This note describes a framework for IPv4/IPv6 translation.  This is
   in the context of replacing NAT-PT [RFC2766], which was deprecated by
   [RFC4966], and to enable networks to have IPv4 and IPv6 coexist in a
   somewhat rational manner while transitioning to an IPv6-only network.

   Deprecation of NAT-PT wasn't intended to say that NAT-PT was "bad",
   nor did the IETF think that deprecating the technology would stop
   people from using it.  As with the 1993 deprecation of the RIP
   routing protocol at the time the Internet was converting to CIDR, the
   point was to inform the community that NAT-PT had operational issues
   and was not considered a viable medium or long term strategy for
   either coexistence or transition.  The point was to encourage network
   operators to actually move in the direction of transition.

   [RFC4213] describes the IETF's view of the most sensible transition
   model.  The IETF recommends, in short, that network operators
   (transit providers, service providers, enterprise networks, small and
   medium business, SOHO and residential customers, and any other kind
   of network that may currently be using IPv4) obtain an IPv6 prefix,
   turn on IPv6 routing within their networks and between themselves and
   any peer, upstream, or downstream neighbors, enable it on their
   computers, and use it in normal processing.  This should be done
   while leaving IPv4 stable, until a point is reached that any
   communication that can be carried out could use either protocol
   equally well.  At that point, the economic justification for running
   both becomes debatable, and network operators can justifiably turn
   IPv4 off.  This process is comparable to that of [RFC4192], which
   describes how to renumber a network using the same address family
   without a flag day.  While running stably with the older system,
   deploy the new.  Use the coexistence period to work out such kinks as
   arise.  When the new is also running stably, shift production to it.
   When network and economic conditions warrant, remove the old, which
   is now no longer necessary.

   The question arises: what if that is infeasible due to the time
   available to deploy or other considerations?  What if the process of
   moving a network and its components or customers is starting too late
   for contract cycles to effect IPv6 turn-up on important parts at a
   point where it becomes uneconomical to deploy global IPv4 addresses
   in new services?  How does one continue to deploy new services
   without balkanizing the network?

   This set of documents describes translation as one of the tools
   networks might use to facilitate coexistence and ultimate transition.

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


1.1.  Why translation?

   Besides dual stack deployment, there are two fundamental approaches
   one could take to interworking between IPv4 and IPv6: tunneling and
   translation.  One could - and in the 6NET we did - build an overlay
   network using the new protocol inside tunnels.  Various proposals
   take that model, including 6to4 [RFC3056], Teredo [RFC4380], ISATAP
   [RFC5214],and DS-Lite [I-D.durand-softwire-dual-stack-lite].  The
   advantage of doing so is that the new is enabled to work without
   disturbing the old protocol, providing connectivity between users of
   the new protocol.  There are two disadvantages to tunneling:

   o  operators of those networks are unable to offer services to users
      of the new architecture, and those users are unable to use the
      services of the underlying infrastructure - it is just bandwidth,
      and

   o  it doesn't enable new protocol users to communicate with old
      protocol users.

   As noted, in this work, we look at Internet Protocol translation as a
   transition strategy.  [RFC4864] forcefully makes the point that many
   of the reasons people use Network Address Translators are met as well
   by routing or protocol mechanisms that preserve the end to end
   addressability of the Internet.  What it did not consider is the case
   in which there is an ongoing requirement to communicate with IPv4
   systems, but configuring IPv4 routing is not in the network
   operator's view the most desirable strategy, or is infeasible due to
   a shortage of global address space.  Translation enables the client
   of a network, whether a transit network, an access network, or an
   edge network, to access the services of the network and communicate
   with other network users regardless of their protocol usage - within
   limits.  Like NAT-PT, IPv4/IPv6 translation under this rubric is not
   a long term support strategy, but it is a medium term coexistence
   strategy that can be used to facilitate a long term program of
   transition.

1.2.  Terminology

   The following terminology is used in this document and other
   documents related to it.

   CPE:  The acronym expands to "Customer Premises Equipment"; in the
      context of this document set, it refers to the router in front of
      a host, whether in an ISP or other network environment, that
      performs some relevant function such as advertising a specific
      prefix.

   Dual Stack implementation:  A Dual Stack implementation, in this
      context, comprises an enabled end system stack plus routing in the
      network.  It implies that two application instances are capable of
      communicating using either IPv4 or IPv6 - they have stacks, they
      have addresses, and they have any necessary network support
      including routing.

   IPv4 capable node:  A node which has an IPv4 protocol stack.  Apart
      from the local LAN, where link-local (169.254.0.0/16) addresses
      might be used without operational intent, an interface on the node
      must be assigned one or more IPv4 addresses for the stack to be
      usable.

   IPv4 enabled node:  A node which has an IPv4 protocol stack and is
      assigned one or more IPv4 addresses that are not link-local
      (169.254.0.0/16).  Both IPv4-only and IPv6/IPv4 nodes are IPv4
      enabled.

   IPv6 capable node:  A node which has an IPv6 protocol stack.  Apart
      from the local LAN, where link-local (FE80::/64) addresses might
      be used without operational intent, an interface on the node must
      be assigned or must autoconfigure one or more IPv6 addresses for
      the stack to be usable.

   IPv6 enabled node:  A node which has an IPv6 protocol stack and one
      or more IPv6 addresses that are not link-local (FE80::/64).  Both
      IPv6-only and IPv6/IPv4 nodes are IPv6 enabled.

   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses:  They are the IPv6 addresses which have
      unique relationship to specific IPv4 addresses.  This relationship
      is self described by embedding IPv4 address in the IPv6 address.
      The IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses are used for both the statesless
      and the stateful modes.

   IPv4-related IPv6 addresses:  They are the IPv6 addresses which have
      unique relationship to specific IPv4 addresses.  This relationship
      is maintained as the states (mapping table between IPv4 address/
      transport_port and IPv6 address/transport_port) in the IP/ICMP
      translator.  The states are session initiated.  The IPv4-related
      IPv6 addresses are used fo the stateful mode only.

   IPv4-only:  An IPv4-only implementation, in this context, comprises
      an enabled end system stack plus routing in the network.  It
      implies that two application instances are capable of
      communicating using IPv4, but not IPv6 - they have an IPv4 stack,
      addresses, and network support including IPv4 routing and
      potentially IPv4/IPv4 translation, but some element is missing
      that prevents communication using IPv6.

   IPv6-only:  An IPv6-only implementation, in this context, comprises
      an enabled end system stack plus routing in the network.  It
      implies that two application instances are capable of
      communicating using IPv6, but not IPv4 - they have an IPv6 stack,
      addresses, and network support including routing in IPv6, but some
      element is missing that prevents communication using IPv4.

   LIR Prefix:  The IPv6 prefix assigned by the network operator for
      embedding IPv4 addresses into IPv6 addresses.  In this case, each
      network running a translator will create a representation of the
      whole IPv4 address space in the IPv6 address space.

   LIR:  See Local Internet Registry.

   Local Internet Registry:  A Local Internet Registry (LIR) is an
      organization which has received an IP address allocation from a
      Regional Internet Registry (RIR), and which may assign parts of
      this allocation to its own internal network or those of its
      customers.  An LIR is thus typically an Internet service provider
      or an enterprise network.

   Physical IPv4 address pool:  Zero or more IPv4 addresses used by the
      translator in stateful translation.

   State:  "State" refers to dynamic information that is stored in a
      network element.  For example, if two systems are connected by a
      TCP connection, each stores information about the connection,
      which is called "connection state".  In this context, the term
      refers to dynamic correlations between IP addresses on either side
      of a translator, or {IP Address, Transport type, transport port
      number} tuples on either side of the translator.  Of stateful
      algorithms, there are at least two major flavors depending on the
      kind of state they maintain:

      Hidden state:  the existence of this state is unknown outside the
         network element that contains it.

      Known state:  the existence of this state is known by other
         network elements.

   Stateful Translation:  A translation algorithm may be said to
      "require state in a network element" or be "stateful" if the
      transmission or reception of a packet creates or modifies a data
      structure in the relevant network element.

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


   Stateless Translation:  A translation algorithm that is not
      "stateful" is "stateless".  It may require configuration of a
      static translation table, or may derive its needed information
      algorithmically from the messages it is translating.

   Well-Known Prefix:  The IPv6 prefix assigned by IANA for embedding
      IPv4 addresses into IPv6 addresses.  In this case, there would be
      a single representation of a public IPv4 address in the IPv6
      address space.

1.3.  Translation objectives

   In any translation model, there is a question of objectives.
   Ideally, one would like to make any system and any application
   running on it able to "talk with" - exchange datagrams supporting
   applications - with any other system running the same application
   regardless of whether they have an IPv4 stack and connectivity or
   IPv6 stack and connectivity.  That was the model NAT-PT, and the
   things it necessitated led to scaling and operational difficulties.

   So the question comes back to what different kinds of connectivity
   can be easily supported and what are harder, and what technologies
   are needed to at least pick the low-hanging fruit.  We observe that
   applications today fall into three main categories:

   Client/Server Application:  Per whatis.com, "'Client/server'
      describes the relationship between two computer programs in which
      one program, the client, makes a service request from another
      program, the server, which fulfills the request."  In networking,
      the behavior of the applications is that connections are initiated
      from client software and systems to server software and systems.
      Examples include mail handling between an end user and his mail
      system (POP3, IMAP, and MUA->MTA SMTP), FTP, the web, and DNS name
      translation.

   Peer to Peer Application:  Peer to peer applications are those that
      transfer information directly, rather than through the use of an
      intermediate repository such as a bulletin board or database.  In
      networking, any system (peer) might initiate a session with any
      other system (peer) at any time.  These in turn fall broadly into
      two categories:

      Peer to peer infrastructure applications:  Examples of
         "infrastructure applications" include SMTP between MTAs,
         Network News, and SIP.  Any MTA might open an SMTP session with
         any other at any time; any SIP Proxy might similarly connect
         with any other SIP Proxy.  An important characteristic of these
         applications is that they use ephemeral sessions - they open



Baker, et al.            Expires August 25, 2009                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


         sessions when they are needed and close them when they are
         done.

      Peer to peer file exchange applications:  Examples of these
         include Limewire, BitTorrent, and UTorrent.  These are
         applications that open some sessions between systems and leave
         them open for long periods of time, and where ephemeral
         sessions are important, are able to learn about the reliability
         of peers from history or by reputation.  They use the long term
         sessions to map content availability.  Short term sessions are
         used to exchange content.  They tend to prefer to ask for
         content from servers that they find reliable and available.

   NAT-PT is an example of a facility with known state - at least two
   software components (the data plane translator and the DNS
   Application Layer Gateway, which may be implemented in the same or
   different systems) share and must coordinate translation state.  A
   typical IPv4/IPv4 NAT implements an algorithm with hidden state.
   Obviously, stateless translation requires less computational overhead
   than stateful translation, and less memory to maintain the state,
   because the translation tables and their associated methods and
   processes exist in a stateful algorithm and don't exist in a
   stateless one.

   If the key questions are the ability to open connections between
   systems, then one must ask who opens connections.

   o  We need a technology that will enable systems that act as clients
      to be able to open sessions with other systems that act as
      servers, whether in the IPv6->IPv4 direction or the IPv4->IPv6
      direction.  Ideally, this is stateless; especially in a carrier
      infrastructure, the preponderance of accesses will be to servers,
      and this optimizes access to them.  However, a stateful algorithm
      is acceptable if the complexity is minimized and a stateless
      algorithm cannot be constructed.

   o  We also need a technology that will allow peers to connect with
      each other, whether in the IPv6->IPv4 direction or the IPv4->IPv6
      direction.  Again, it would be ideal if this was stateless, but a
      stateful algorithm is acceptable if the complexity is minimized
      and a stateless algorithm cannot be constructed.  In the case of
      infrastructure applications, which know nothing of choosing among
      peers by reputation, the IPv4->IPv6 direction is a stronger
      requirement.  Peer to peer file exchange applications, however,
      may be more forgiving - it may well be adequate to make a subset
      of IPv4->IPv6 connections work instead of all.  (EDITOR'S NOTE: I
      would be very interested in comments on this assertion)

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


   o  We do not need an algorithm that enables clients to connect to
      clients, because they don't connect.

   The complexity arguments bring us in the direction of hidden state:
   if state must be shared between the application and the translator or
   between translation components, complexity and deployment issues are
   greatly magnified.  We would very much prefer that any software
   changes be confined to the translator.

1.4.  Transition Plan

   While the design of IPv4 made it impossible for IPv6 to be compatible
   on the wire, the designers intended that it would coexist with IPv4
   during a period of transition.  The primary mode of coexistence was
   dual-stack operation - routers would be dual-stacked so that the
   network could carry both address families, and IPv6-capable hosts
   could be dual-stack to maintain access to IPv4-only partners.  The
   goal was that the preponderance of hosts and routers in the Internet
   would be IPv6-capable long before IPv4 address space allocation was
   completed.  At this time, it appears the exhaustion of IPv4 address
   space will occur before significant IPv6 adoption.

   Curran's "A Transition Plan for IPv6" [RFC5211] proposes a three-
   phase progression:

   Preparation Phase (current):  characterized by pilot use of IPv6,
      primarily through transition mechanisms defined in RFC 4213, and
      planning activities.

   Transition Phase (2010 through 2011):  characterized by general
      availability of IPv6 in provider networks which SHOULD be native
      IPv6; organizations SHOULD provide IPv6 connectivity for their
      Internet-facing servers, but SHOULD still provide IPv4-based
      services via a separate service name.

   Post-Transition Phase (2012 and beyond):  characterized by a
      preponderance of IPv6-based services and diminishing support for
      IPv4-based services.

   In each of these phases, the coexistence problem and solution space
   has a different focus:

   Preparation Phase:  Coexistence tools are needed to facilitate early
      adopters by removing impediments to IPv6 deployment, and to assure
      that nothing is lost by adopting IPv6, in particular that the IPv6
      adopter has unfettered access to the global IPv4 Internet
      regardless of whether they have a global IPv4 address (or any IPv4
      address or stack at all.)  While it might appear reasonable for

      the cost and operational burden to be borne by the early adopter,
      the shared goal of promoting IPv6 adoption would argue against
      that model.  Additionally, current IPv4 users should not be forced
      to retire or upgrade their equipment and the burden remains on
      service providers to carry and route native IPv4.

   Transition Phase:  While IPv6 adoption can be expected to accelerate,
      there will still be a significant portion of the Internet
      operating in IPv4-only or preferring IPv4.  During this phase the
      norm shifts from IPv4 to IPv6, and coexistence tools evolve to
      ensure interoperability between domains that may be restricted to
      IPv4 or IPv6.

   Post-Transition Phase:  In this phase, IPv6 is ubiquitous and the
      burden of maintaining interoperability shifts to those who choose
      to maintain IPv4-only systems.  While these systems should be
      allowed to live out their economic life cycles, the IPv4-only
      legacy users at the edges should bear the cost of coexistence
      tools, and at some point service provider networks should not be
      expected to carry and route native IPv4 traffic.

   The choice between the terms "transition" versus "coexistence" has
   engendered long philosophical debate.  "Transition" carries the sense
   that we are going somewhere, while "coexistence" seems more like we
   are sitting somewhere.  Historically with IETF, "transition" has been
   the term of choice [RFC4213][RFC5211], and the tools for
   interoperability have been called "transition mechanisms".  There is
   some perception or conventional wisdom that adoption of IPv6 is being
   impeded by the deficiency of tools to facilitate interoperability of
   nodes or networks that are constrained (in some way, fully or
   partially) from full operation in one of the address families.  In
   addition, it is apparent that transition will involve a period of
   coexistence; the only real question is how long that will last.

   Thus, coexistence is an integral part of the transition plan, not in
   conflict with it, but there will be a balancing act.  It starts out
   being a way for early adopters to easily exploit the bigger IPv4
   Internet, and ends up being a way for late/never adopters to hang on
   with IPv4 (at their own expense, with minimal impact or visibility to
   the Internet).  One way to look at solutions is that cost incentives
   (both monetary cost and the operational overhead for the end user)
   should encourage IPv6 and discourage IPv4.  That way natural market
   forces will keep the transition moving - especially as the legacy
   IPv4-only stuff ages out of use.  There will come a time to set a
   date after which no one is obligated to carry native IPv4 but it
   would be premature to attempt to do so yet.  The end goal should not
   be to eliminate IPv4 by fiat, but rather render it redundant through
   ubiquitous IPv6 deployment.  IPv4 may never go away completely, but

   rational plans should move the costs of maintaining IPv4 to those who
   insist on using it after wide adoption of IPv6.

1.5.  Expected uses of translation

   There are several potential uses of translation.  They are all easily
   described in terms of "interoperation between a set of systems that
   only communicate using IPv4 and a set of systems that only
   communicate using IPv6", but the differences at a detail level make
   them interesting.  At minimum, these include:

   o  Connection of IPv4-only islands to an IPv6-only network, which
      might include

      *  Connecting a small pool of legacy equipment with a view to
         eventual obsolescence

      *  Connecting a legacy network with a view to eventual transition.

   o  Connection of IPv6-only islands to an IPv4-only network

   o  Connecting IPv4-only devices with IPv6-only devices regardless of
      network type

   o  Connections between IPv4-only networks and IPv6-only networks,
      especially as a service within a large network such as an
      enterprise or ISP network or between peer networks.

1.5.1.  Connection of IPv4-only islands to an IPv6-only network

   While the basic issue is the same, there are at least two interesting
   special cases of this: connecting a small pool of legacy equipment
   with a view to eventual obsolescence, and connecting a legacy network
   with a view to eventual transition.

   In the first case, Figure 1, one might have a pool of equipment

   serves or some equipment in that network is IPv6-only.  One pools the
   IPv4-only devices behind a translator, which enables IPv6-only

   systems to connect to the IPv4-only equipment.  If the network is
   dual stack and only some of the equipment is IPv6-only, the
   translator should be a function of a router, and the router should
   provide normal IPv4 routing services as well as IPv6->IPv4
   translation.

                   Figure 2: Customer dual stack network

   Figure 2 creates transition options to a customer network connected
   to an IPv6-only ISP, or some equivalent relationship.  The customer
   might internally be using traditional IPv4 with NAT services, and the
   ISP might change its connection to an IPv6-only network and encourage
   it to transition.  If the ISP assigns a /60 prefix to a SOHO, for
   example, the CPE router in the SOHO could distribute several dual
   stack subnets internally, one for wireless and one for each of
   several fixed LANs (the entertainment system, his office, her office,
   etc).  One of the /64 prefixes would be dedicated to representing the
   SOHO's IPv4 addresses in the ISP or the IPv4 network beyond it, and
   the other prefixes for the various internal subnets.  Internally, the
   subnets might carry prefix pairs 192.168.n.0/24 and 2001:db8:0.n::/64
   for n in 1..15 (1..0xF), and externally might appear as 2001:db8:0:
   n::/64 for the IPv6 subnets and 2001:db8::192.168.n.0/120 for the
   IPv4 devices.  Note that to connect to an IPv4-only network beyond,
   RFC 1918 addresses would have to be statefully mapped using
   traditional IPv4 mechanisms somewhere; if this is done by the ISP,
   collusion on address mapping is required, and the case in
   Section 1.5.4 is probably a better choice.

   In this environment, the key issue is that one wants a prefix that
   enables the entire [RFC1918] address space to be embedded in a single
   /64 prefix, with the assumption that any routing structure behind the

1.5.3.  Connecting IPv4-only devices with IPv6-only devices

1.5.4.  ISP-supported connections between IPv4-only networks and IPv6-

   In this case (see Figure 3) we presume that a service provider or
   equivalent is offering a service in a network in which IPv4 routing
   is not supported, but customers are allocated relatively large pools
   of general IPv6 addresses, suitable for clients of IPv4 or IPv6
   hosts, and relatively small pools of addresses mapped to global IPv4
   addresses that are intended to be accessible to IPv4 peers and
   clients through translation.  Presumably, there are a number of such
   customers, and the administration wishes to use normal routing to
   manage the issues.

   As a carrier offering, there is also a need for stateless
   translation, to accomplish two things: the ability to use multiple
   translators in parallel without having to maintain state among them,
   and to minimize the software overhead on the translator for systems
   that communicate regularly.  There may also be stateful translation,
   the purpose of which is temporary connections between systems that do
   so only occasionally.

     Figure 3: Service provider translation with multiple interchange
                                  points

   Since [RFC4291] specifies that routable IPv6 prefixes are 64 bits or
   shorter apart from host routes, one wishes to allocate each customer
   a /64 mapped to a few IPv4 addresses and a shorter prefix for his
   general use.  The customer's CPE advertises the two prefixes into the
   IPv6 routing domain to attract relevant traffic.  The translator
   advertises the mapped equivalent of an IPv4 default route into the
   IPv6 domain to attract all other traffic to it, for translation into
   the IPv4 routing domain.  It also advertises an appropriate IPv4
   prefix aggregating the mapped prefixes into the IPv4 domain to
   attract traffic intended for these customers.

   In this case, the LIR prefix MUST be within /32../63; a /64 puts the
   entire IPv4 address space into the host part, which is equivalent to
   the case in Section 1.5.1, and a prefix shorter than /32 wastes space
   with no redeeming argument.  In general, the LIR prefix should be 64
   bits less the length of IPv4 prefixes it allocates to its IPv4-mapped
   customers.  For example, if it is allocating a mapped IPv4 /24 to
   each customer, the LIR prefix used for mapping between IPv4 and IPv6
   addresses should be a /40, and the least significant bits in the IPv4
   address form the host part of the address.

   Note that the significant difference between doing this between
   specific networks and between "the IPv4 Internet" and "the IPv6

   Internet" is primarily in the Advertised IPv4 Prefix and the LIR
   Prefix.  Between specific networks, or between a specific IPv6
   network and the general IPv4 network, the translators and the DNS
   server are operated by the same operator, and as a result the IPv6
   network is likely to use the same Advertised IPv4 Prefix and the same
   LIR prefix.  Between general networks, they may have different
   operators or the same operator may have differing requirements.  As
   result, they will use different Advertised IPv4 Prefixes and LIR
   prefixes.  The algorithm, however, is the same.


2.  Framework

   Having laid out the preferred transition model and the options for
   implementing it (Section 1.1), defined terms (Section 1.2),
   considered the requirements (Section 1.3), considered the transition
   model (Section 1.4), and considered the kinds of networks the
   facility would support (Section 1.5), we now turn to a framework for
   IPv4/IPv6 translation.  This framework has three main parts:

   o  The recommended address format

   o  The functional components of a translation solution, which include

      *  A DNS Translator,

      *  An optional stateless translator, or/and

      *  An optional stateful translator.

   o  The operational characteristics of the solution.

2.1.  Translation Scenario and Operation Mode

   In this document, we only discuss the scenario:

   Connecting an IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet, including

   (1) An IPv6 network to the IPv4 Internet.

   (2) The IPv4 Internet to an IPv6 network.

2.1.1.  Translation Model

   The translation model is shown in the following figure.

                        Figure 4: Translation Model

2.1.2.  Operation Mode of the Translator

   There are two translation modes: stateless translation and stateful
   translation.  For the stateless translation, the translation
   information is carried in the address itself, permitting both
   IPv4->IPv6 and IPv6->IPv4 sessions establishment.  For the stateful
   translation, the translation state is maintained between IPv4
   address/port pairs and IPv6 address/port pairs, enabling IPv6 systems
   to open sessions with IPv4 systems.

   In order to perform the required function, the translator needs to
   represent the IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 Internet and the IPv6
   addresses in the IPv4 Internet.

   For the representation of the IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 Internet,
   both stateless and stateful translation schemes use the same method,
   i.e. embedding the original IPv4 address in the IPv6 address.

   For the representation of the IPv6 addresses in the IPv4 Internet,
   the stateless and stateful translation schemes use different methods.

   (1) For the stateless translation, a subset of IPv6 address can be
   defined by embedding the original IPv4 address in the IPv6 address.
   The original IPv4 address will serve as the IPv6 representation in
   the IPv4 land.

   (2) For the stateful translation, representing arbitrary IPv6
   addresses in the IPv4 Internet requires some form of translation
   state that will define the mapping between the original IPv6 address
   and its representation in the IPv4 land.

2.2.  Embedded Address Format

   Embedding IPv4 address in IPv6 address (defined as IPv4-embedded IPv6
   address) will be formed by concatenating a prefix to the IPv4 address
   and optionally a suffix.  The prefix is called the PREFIX and the
   suffix is called SUFFIX.  The resulting IPv6 representation is
   depicted in the figure below.


             0  8  16 24 32 40 48 56 64                    127
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
             |  PREFIX      | IPv4 addr |  SUFFIX            |
             +--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
             |<--- network part ---->|<---   host part   --->|


                     Figure 5: Embedded Address Format

   For the representation of the IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 Internet in
   both stateless and stateful modes, the PREFIX is advertised in the
   IPv6 network by the translator, and packets addressed to this PRFIX
   will be routed to the translator.  This PREFIX is configured for each
   translator, and DNS ALG.

   For the representation of the IPv6 addresses in the IPv4 Internet in
   the stateless mode, more specifics (defined as IVI6) inside this
   PREFIX are advertised in the ISP's IPv6 network by the CPE routers,
   and packets addressed to the more specifcs inside this PREFIX will be
   routed to the IPv6 end systems.  This PREFIX is not used for the
   representation of the IPv6 addresses in the IPv4 Internet in the
   stateless mode.

   As shown in Figure 5, the embedded address format has three
   components:

   bits 0..n-1 (PREFIX):  An LIR-specified prefix, either 32..63 bits
      long or 96 bits long,

   bits n..n+31  An embedded IPv4 address.  Except in the case of a 96
      bit prefix, this address intentionally straddles the boundary
      between [RFC4291]'s 64 bit "subnet" locator and its 64 bit host
      identifier.  The intention is that the /64 be used in routing and
      the bits in the host part be used for host identification as
      described in the address architecture.

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


   bits n+32..127 (SUFFIX):  Entirely zero; note that if n=96, this is
      null.

   The selection of the PREFIX, the prefix length and SUFFIX is
   discussed in the following sections.

2.2.1.  LIR prefix versus Well-Known prefix

2.2.1.1.  Stateless mode

2.2.1.1.1.  IPv6 Routing system scalability

   In the stateless mode, the more specifics inside the IPv4-embedded
   IPv6 address block are used to represent the IPv6 end systems,
   therefore the LIR prefix should be used.  The reason is that the LIR
   prefix can be aggregated in the ISP's border routers and will not
   affect the global IPv6 routing system.  On the other hand, if the
   Well-Known prefix is used, the global IPv4 routing table will be
   inserted into the global IPv6 routing system, which is known to be a
   very bad idea.

   In the stateless mode, it is possible to use LIR prefix to represent
   the IPv6 addresses in the IPv4 Internet and use Well-Known prefix to
   represent the IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 Internet.  However, this is
   also a bad idea.  The reason is that there will be two possible IPv6
   addresses to represent a single IPv4 host, i.e. if the IPv4 address
   is used by a host in the IPv4 Internet, a Well-Known prefix should be
   used; if the IPv4 address (as IVI6) is used by a host in the IPv6
   Internet, a LIR prefix should be used.  The IVI6 hosts must know
   which one to use in order to communicate with that host.  However, if
   the LIR prefix is used in both representations, this problem is
   solved by the "more specific win" routing principle.

   The potential leakage of the IPv6 more specifics introduced by using
   LIR prefix could be controlled by ISP's general routing practice,
   since this specific is the same compared with other more specifics
   inside ISP's autonomous system.

2.2.1.1.2.  Referral support

   For the referral support in the stateless mode, only the IVI6 hosts
   use LIR prefix to represent IPv4 addresses in IPv6 and the IVI6 hosts
   know the PREFIX, therefore, the IVI6 hosts could pass the original
   IPv4 addresses to the other hosts rather than mapped form and the
   referral support is the same as in the dual-stack case.

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


2.2.1.1.3.  Native connectivity preference in communications involving
            dual stack nodes

   In the stateless mode, the IVI6 hosts are IPv6 single-stack host,
   therefore, the native connectivity preference can be achieve
   automatically.

2.2.1.1.4.  DNS ALG configuration

   For the DNS ALG configuration in the stateless mode, the IVI6 hosts
   know the PREFIX, therefore, DNS ALG can be implemented in the end-
   system without additional information.

2.2.1.1.5.  Support for multiple translators

   Support for multiple translators in the stateless mode, either LIR or
   suffix can be used to identify different translators.

2.2.1.2.  Stateful mode

2.2.1.2.1.  IPv6 Routing system scalability

   In the stateful mode, it is possible to either use LIR prefix or
   Well-Known prefix to represent the IPv4 addresses in the IPv6
   Internet.  If the LIR prefix is used, the protential leakge of the
   IPv6 more specifics may happen.  This can be filtered at the ISP's
   border routers via manual configuration.  If the Well-Known prefix is
   used, the configuration could be simplier since it is the unique
   Well-Known prefix.

2.2.1.2.2.  Referral support

   This section analyzes the impact of the prefix type selected for
   representing the IPv4 addresses in the IPv6 Internet in the referral
   operations.

   A referral operation is when a host A passes the IP address of a Host
   B to a third Host C as application data.  The host Host C will then
   initiate a communication towards the Host B using the IP address
   received.  This is not a rare operation in some type of applications,
   such as VoIP or peer-to-peer applications.

   All the scenarios where Host A and Host C are in different IP
   version, they require a specific ALG, since the IP address
   information contained as application data must be translated, in
   order to be meaningful a the receiver.

   A general observation about these scenarios is that in the case a



Baker, et al.            Expires August 25, 2009               [Page 20]

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


   Well-Known prefix is used, it would be possible for the ALG to
   identify the IPv6 addresses containing an embedded IPv4 address and
   translate it, cause they could identify the Well-Known prefix and
   know that are not general use IPv6 addresses.  If the PREFIX is a LIR
   prefix, it may be possible for the ALG to translate the address in
   the referral, as long as the translator is configured to know that
   this specific prefix is unused to map IPv4 addresses.  So, a Well-
   Known prefix is more likely to work with referral in the case that
   ALG is needed than the LIR prefix.

2.2.1.2.3.  Native connectivity preference in communications involving
            dual stack nodes

   When dual stack nodes are involved in the communication, the
   potential issue is that they prefer translated connectivity over the
   native connectivity.  There are multiple ways to try to deal with
   this issue.

   Communication initiated from an IPv6-only node towards a dual stack
   node: In this case, the IPv6 only node will query for the FQDN of the
   dual stack node.  The DNS ALG function will try first to get the AAAA
   RR.  Since there is one available, it will return it and no AAAA RR
   will be synthesized from the A RR of the dual stack node.  However,
   it should be noted that the DNS64 must first try to get the real AAAA
   RR before starting the synthesis, if not, it may result in the
   aforementioned problem.

   Communication initiated from a dual stack node toward an IPv4 only
   node: Nodes that have both IPv6 and IPv4 connectivity and are
   configured with an address for a DNS ALG as their resolving
   nameserver may receive responses containing synthetic AAAA resource
   records.  If the node prefers IPv6 over IPv4, using the addresses in
   the synthetic AAAA RRs means that the node will attempt to
   communicate through the translator mechanism first, and only fall
   back to native IPv4 connectivity if connecting through translator
   fails (if the application tries the full set of destination
   addresses).  In order to the node prefers native connectivity, we can
   configure the PREFIX in the RFC3484 policy table.  If a Well-Known
   prefix is used, it can be configured in the default policy table.  If
   we use a LIR prefix, we need a mean to properly configure the policy
   table, which is not currently available (only manual configuration is
   currently defined) (see [I-D.ietf-6man-addr-select-sol] for more on
   this topic).

2.2.1.2.4.  DNS ALG configuration

   The DNS ALG function can be placed either in the DNS server or in the
   end host.  In order to synthesize AAAA RR, the DNS ALG function needs



Baker, et al.            Expires August 25, 2009               [Page 21]

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


   to know the PREFIX.  In the case that a Well-Known prefix is used,
   the PREFIX information can be hardcoded in the DNS ALG code,
   requiring no additional tools for learning it.  In the case that a
   LIR prefix is used, the DNS ALG needs to discover the PREFIX
   information.  In the case that the DNS ALG is located in the servers,
   it may be a viable option to manually configure the PREFIX in the DNS
   ALG for a few servers.  However, in the case the the DNS ALG is
   located in the hosts, the manual option seems inconvenient and
   alternative automatic means need to be provisioned.  Moreover, since
   this information is used for DNSSEC operations, the mechanism to
   configure the PREFIX need to be secure.  The result is that the LIR
   prefix option requires more tools than the Well-Known prefix.

2.2.1.2.5.  Support for multiple translators

   This issue is somehow orthogonal on whether the prefix is Well-Known
   or LIR.  In both cases, it is possible to use a single prefix for
   multiple translators or different prefixes for different translators.
   In any case, this would be achieved by inserting (or not) some subnet
   bits between the prefix and the embedded IPv4 address that would be
   used to identify the translator box.  This issue does have
   implications on some of the different issues considered before.  In
   particular, if a per translator prefix is used, then there is the
   need to configure the prefix in the DNS ALG, so the non configuration
   feature of the Well-Known prefix is no longer achieved.

2.2.2.  Prefix length

   One issue that is worth considering is the one related to IPv6
   address consumption.  In particular, depending on the selected prefix
   length, IPv6 address consumption can become an issue.  If we consider
   the case of the Well-Know prefix, the prefix would be allocated by
   IANA for this particular purpose.  As such, it seems reasonable that
   a short prefix can be obtained for this.  Requesting for a /24 or
   even a few bits shorter seems feasible.  The potential benefit of
   this is that IPv4 prefixes can be represented as IPv6 prefixes that
   are shorter than 64 bits.  This would result in routing based on the
   upper 64 bits, which is compatible with current IPv6 practices.  For
   instance, if we use a /24 for the Well-Know prefix, an IPv4 /24 would
   result in an IPv6 /48, which seems somehow equivalent from the
   routing perspective.

   On the other hand, if we go for the LIR prefix option, then the
   prefix must come out of the IPv6 allocation for the site running the
   translator.  If the site running the translator is an ISP, then
   probably the allocation of the ISP is a /32 or shorter, so, it may be
   possible for the ISP to allocate a somehow short prefix for this,
   maybe a /40.  However, if the translator is run by an end site, which



Baker, et al.            Expires August 25, 2009               [Page 22]

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


   normal allocation is a /48, then the LIR prefix for the translator
   should be much longer than that, possibly a /56.  So, in the case the
   site needs to route based on the IPv4 prefix embedded in the IPv6
   address (e.g. in order to access to different parts of the IPv4 space
   through different routes), then it is likely that it will need to
   route on the lower 64 bits of the IPv6 address.

   According to current specifications, routers must handle routes
   containing prefixes of any valid length, from 0 to 128.  However,
   some users have reported that routers exhibit worse performance when
   routing using long prefixes, in particular when using prefixes longer
   than 80 bits.  This implies that using prefixes shorter than that
   would result in better performance in some cases.

2.2.3.  Suffix

   In the current implementation of the stateless mode, the suffix is
   entirely zero.  For the stateful mode when using Well-Known prefix,
   the suffix can be used to represent different NAT boxes.

2.2.4.  Recommdations

   For the PREFIX selection, we recommand to use LIR prefix.  For the
   stateful translator, the Well-Known prefix can be used.

   For the prefix length selection, there are some obvious values that
   might be popular, including /40, /44, and /96, but there is no
   requirement than any of them be used; this is left to the operator's
   discretion.

   For the SUFFIX selection, it is is entirely zero at this time.
   However, it could be used for the future extension of the translation
   functions.

2.3.  Translation components

   As noted in Section 1.5,translation involves several components.  An
   IPv4 client or peer must be able to determine the address of its
   server by obtaining an A record from DNS even if the server is IPv6-
   only - only has an IPv6 stack, or is in an IPv6-only network.
   Similarly, an IPv6 client or peer must be able to determine the
   address of its server by obtaining an AAAA record from DNS even if
   the server is IPv4-only - only has an IPv4 stack, or is in an IPv4-
   only network.  Given the address, the client/peer must be able to
   initiate a connection to the server/peer, and the server/peer must be
   able to reply.  It would be very nice if this scaled to the size of
   regional networks with straightforward operational practice.

   To that end, we describe four subsystems:

   o  A Domain Name System Translator

   o  A stateless IPv4/IPv6 translator

   o  A stateful IPv4/IPv6 translator

   o  Translators for some applications

2.3.1.  DNS Translator

   [I-D.bagnulo-behave-dns64] describes the mechanisms by which a DNS
   Translator is intended to operate.  It is designed to operate on the
   basis of known but fixed state: the resource records, and therefore
   the names and addresses, that it translates are known to network
   elements outside of the data plane translator, but the process of
   serving them to applications does not interact with the data plane
   translator in any way.

   There are at least three possible implementations of a DNS
   Translator:

   Static records:  One could literally program DNS with corresponding A
      and AAAA records.  This is most appropriate for stub services such
      as access to a legacy printer pool.

   Dynamic Translation of static records:  In more general operation,
      the expected behavior is for the application to request both A and
      AAAA records, and for an A record to be (retrieved and) translated
      by the DNS translator if and only if no reachable AAAA record
      exists.  This has ephemeral issues with cached translations, which
      can be dealt with by caching only the source record and forcing it
      to be translated whenever accessed.

   Static or Dynamic Translation of Dynamic DNS records:  In Dynamic DNS
      usage, a system could potentially report the translation of a name
      using a Mapped IPv4 Address, or using both a Mapped IPv4 Address
      and some other address.  The DNS translator has several options;
      it could store a AAAA record for the Mapped IPv4 Address and
      depend on translation of that for A records inline, it could store
      both an A and a AAAA record, or (when there is another IPv6
      address as well which is stored as the AAAA record) it could store
      only the A record.

2.3.2.  Stateless Translation - IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses

   [I-D.baker-behave-v4v6-translation] describes and defines the
   behavior of a stateless translator.  This is an optional facility;
   one could implement or deploy only the stateful mode described in
   Section 2.3.3, at the cost of being able to have systems with IPv6
   addresses that are not embedded to IPv4 addresses access IPv4 servers
   and peers.  Stateless translation enables IPv4-only clients and peers
   to initiate connections to IPv6-only servers or peers equipped with
   IPv4-embedded IPv6 addresses, as described in Figure 3.  It also
   enables scalable coordination of IPv4-only stub networks or ISP IPv6-
   only networks as described in Figure 2.

   In addition, since [RFC3484]address selection would select a IPv4-
   embedded IPv6 address when it is available, stateless translation
   enables IPv6 clients and peers with Mapped IPv4 Addresses to open
   connections with IPv4 servers and peers in a scalable fashion,
   supporting asynchronous routes.

2.3.3.  Stateful translation - IPv4-related IPv6 address

   [I-D.baker-behave-v4v6-translation] also describes and defines the
   behavior of the data plane component of a stateful translator.
   [I-D.bagnulo-behave-nat64] describes the management of the state
   tables necessitated by stateful translation.  Like stateful
   translation, this is an optional facility; one could implement or
   deploy only the stateful mode described in Section 2.3.2, at the cost
   of IPv4 access to IPv6-only servers and peers, the ability to use
   multiple translators interchangeably, and some level of scalability.
   Stateful translation is defined to enable IPv6 clients and peers
   without Mapped IPv4 Addresses to connect to IPv4-only servers and
   peers.

   Stateful translation could be defined to enable IPv4 clients and
   peers to connect to IPv6-only servers and peers without Mapped IPv4
   Addresses.  This is far more complex, however, and is out of scope in
   the present work.

2.3.4.  Translation gateway technologies

   In addition, some applications require special support.  An example
   is FTP.  FTP's active mode doesn't work well across NATs without
   extra support such as SOCKS.  Across NATs, it generally uses passive
   mode.  However, the designers of FTP inexplicably wrote different and
   incompatible passive mode implementations for IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
   Hence, either they need to fix FTP, or a translator must be written
   for the application.  Other applications may be similarly broken.

   As a general rule, a simple operational recommendation will work
   around many application issues, which is that there should be a
   server in each domain or an instance of the server should have an
   interface in each domain.  For example, an SMTP MTA may be confused
   by finding an IPv6 address in its EHLO when it is connected to using
   IPv4 (or vice versa), but would perfectly well if it had an interface
   in both the IPv4 and IPv6 domains and was used as an application
   layer bridge between them.

2.4.  Translation in operation

   Operationally, there are two ways that translation could be used - as
   a permanent solution making transition "the other guy's problem", and
   as a temporary solution for a new part of one's network while
   bringing up IPv6 services in the remaining parts of one's network.
   The delay could, for example, be caused by contract cycles that
   prevent IPv6 deployment during the life of the contract.  We
   obviously recommend the latter.  For the IPv4 parts of the network,
   [RFC4213]'s recommendation holds: bringing IPv6 up in those domains,
   moving production to it, and then taking down the now-unnecessary
   IPv4 service when economics warrant remains the least risk approach
   to transition.

                  Figure 6: Translation Operational Model

   During the coexistence phase, as shown in Figure 6, one expects a
   combination of hosts - IPv6-only gaming devices and handsets, older
   computer operating systems that are IPv4-only, and modern mainline
   operating systems that support both.  One also expects a combination
   of networks - dual stack devices operating in single stack networks
   are effectively single stack, whether that stack is IPv4 or IPv6, as
   the other isn't providing communications services.

2.4.1.  Impact Outside the Network Layer

   The potential existence of IP/ICMP translators is already taken care
   of from a protocol perspective in [RFC2460].  However, an IPv6 node
   that wants to be able to use translators needs some additional logic
   in the network layer.

   The network layer in an IPv6-only node, when presented by the
   application with either an IPv4 destination address or an IPv4-mapped
   IPv6 destination address, is likely to drop the packet and return
   some error message to the application.  In order to take advantage of
   translators such a node should instead send an IPv6 packet where the
   destination address is the IPv4-mapped address and the source address
   is the node's temporarily assigned IPv4-translated address.  If the
   node does not have a temporarily assigned IPv4-translated address it
   should acquire one using mechanisms that are not discussed in this
   document.

   Note that the above also applies to a dual IPv4/IPv6 implementation
   node which is not configured with any IPv4 address.

   There are no extra changes needed to applications to operate through
   a translator beyond what applications already need to do to operate
   on a dual node.  The applications that have been modified to work on
   a dual node already have the mechanisms to determine whether they are
   communicating with an IPv4 or an IPv6 peer.  Thus if the applications
   need to modify their behavior depending on the type of the peer, such
   as ftp determining whether to fall back to using the PORT/PASV
   command when EPRT/EPSV fails (as specified in [RFC2428]), they
   already need to do that when running on dual nodes and the presence
   of translators does not add anything.  For example, when using the
   socket API [RFC3493] the applications know that the peer is IPv6 if
   they get an AF_INET6 address from the name service and the address is
   not an IPv4-mapped address (i.e., IN6_IS_ADDR_V4MAPPED returns
   false).  If this is not the case, i.e., the address is AF_INET or an
   IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, the peer is IPv4.

   One way of viewing the translator, which might help clarify why
   applications do not need to know that a translator is used, is to
   look at the information that is passed from the transport layer to



Baker, et al.            Expires August 25, 2009               [Page 27]

Internet-Draft     Framework for IPv4/IPv6 Translation     February 2009


   the network layer.  If the transport passes down an IPv4 address
   (whether or not is in the IPv4-mapped encoding) this means that at
   some point there will be IPv4 packets generated.  In a dual node the
   generation of the IPv4 packets takes place in the sending node.  In
   an IPv6-only node conceptually the only difference is that the IPv4
   packet is generated by the translator - all the information that the
   transport layer passed to the network layer will be conveyed to the
   translator in some form.  That form just "happens" to be in the form
   of an IPv6 header.

2.5.  Unsolved problems

   Just say "multicast"; this framework could support multicast, but at
   this point does not.  This is a place for future work.

   As noted, IPv4 client/peer access to IPv6 servers and peers lacking
   Mapped IPv4 Addresses is not solved.

   Interoperation between IPv4-only clients and IPv6-only clients is not
   supported, and is not believed to be needed.


3.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requires no parameter assignment by the IANA.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.


4.  Security Considerations

   One "security" issue has been raised, with an address format that was
   considered and rejected for that reason.  At this point, the editor
   knows of no other security issues raised by the address format that
   are not already applicable to the addressing architecture in general.
