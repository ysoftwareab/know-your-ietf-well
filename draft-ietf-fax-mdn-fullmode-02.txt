Abstract

This memo defines an additional MIME content-type defined in Message 
Disposition Notifications (MDN) that may be used by a mail user agent 
(UA) which is capable of Internet Fax Full Mode with Capabilities 
exchange and Confirmation of receipt. This content-type is intended to 
be machine-processable. Additional message headers are also defined to 
permit that the sender (of the message) requires Message Disposition 
Notifications (MDNs). MDN is "An Extensible Message Format for Message 
Disposition Notification" in RFC2298.

Extended MDN for IFAX Full Mode                        11 September 1998
Internet Draft


1. Introduction

This memo defines an additional MIME content-type for extended message 
disposition notifications (MDNs) for Intenet FAX Full Mode. MDN is 
defined in "An Extensible Message Format for Message Disposition 
Notification" in RFC2298 [3]. Internet FAX Full 
Mode which has capability exchange and confirmation is defined in 
ITU-T F.185 [7] and T.37 [8]. An extended MDN can be used to 
exchange Internet FAX recipient capabilities and to notify the sender 
of a message of any of several conditions that may occur after 
successful delivery, such as reception of the Internet FAX Full Mode 
or the recipient error in process of the Internet FAX Full Mode. An 
extended MDN will be used for terminal to terminal capabilities 
exchange and confirmation in Internet FAX Full Mode. Capability 
exchange more than Internet FAX and TIFF-FX such as MS Word 
application and PDF file are out of scope. The 
"message/disposition-notification" content-type defined herein is 
intended for use within the framework of the "multipart/report" 
content type defined in RFC 1892 [6].

Internet FAX Full Mode is defined in F.185 [7] as follows;

(a)Capabilities of the terminals are exchanged.

(b)An acknowledgment of receipt is exchanged between gateways
   and may be transferred from the receiving terminal to sending 
   terminal

(c)The contents of standard messages used by the transmitting 
   terminal are preserved

This memo defines the format of the capability exchange and 
confirmation for Internet FAX Full Mode and the RFC 822 headers used 
to request them.

The key words "MUST","MUST NOT","REQUIRED","SHALL","SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD","SHOULD NOT","RECOMENDED","MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [4].

New parameters of Disposition-Notification-Option header, modifier, 
field are written with prefix "G3Fax-" to make clear the extension 
from MDN. These parameters will be registered to IANA.

Internet Draft


1.1 Purposes

The extended MDNs defined in this memo are expected to serve 
several purposes:

(a)Allow a sender of Internet FAX Full Mode to request 
   capabilities of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode in terminal 
   to terminal communication;

(b)Notify capabilities of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode to 
   the sender of Internet FAX Full Mode.

(c)Allow a sender of Internet FAX Full Mode to send image using 
   full function of TIFF-FX based on notified capabilities of 
   recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode, to send command and to 
   request report of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode;

(d)Notify report of recipient's Internet FAX Full Mode to the 
   sender of Internet FAX Full Mode with part of received message, 
   and may notify capabilities

(e)Inform human beings of the disposition of messages after 
   Successful delivery of Internet FAX Full Mode message, in a 
   manner which is largely independent of human language;

(f)Allow Language-independed, yet reasonably precise, indications 
   of the disposition of a message to be delivered in Internet 
   FAX Full Mode.

(g)Allow G3FAX applications such as Polling, Selective Polling,
   Subaddress, Relay, Password, BFT and NSF based on ITU-T T.30 
   protocol.	


1.2 Requirements

These purposes place the following constraints on the capability 
exchange and confirmation protocol:

(a)It must be readable by humans as well as being machine 
   parsable for Internet FAX Full mode.

(b)It must be provide enough information to allow Internet FAX 
   Full Mode message senders to unambiguously associate an MDN 
   with the message that was sent and the original recipient 
   address for which the MDN is issued.

Extended MDN for IFAX Full Mode                        11 September 1998
Internet Draft

(c)It must also be able to describe the disposition of a Internet 
   FAX Full Mode message independent of any particular human 
   language or of the terminology of any particular mail system.

(d)The specification must be extensible in order to accommodate 
   future requirements of Internet FAX Full Mode.


1.3 Extension from MDN

For the purposes, MDS in RFC2298 [3] is extended and modified as 
follows for Internet FAX Full Mode.

(a)MDN is send automatically. The operator should recognize that 
   Internet FAX full Mode sends MDN by default setting.

(b)An empty message is used for capability request.
 


2.  Method of capability exchange and confirmation

A communication between Internet FAX Full Mode machines consists of 
two phases that are the capability exchange phase and the message 
transmission and confirmation phase. 
In the capability exchange phase, a sender of Internet FAX Full Mode 
sends a request for a Message Disposition Notification which is an 
empty mail message with a Disposition-Notification-To header.  A 
recipient of Internet FAX Full Mode SHOULD immediately return message 
with its capabilities using extended MDN.  This is a change of behavior 
from the MDN. 
In the message transmission and confirmation phase, based on this 
reply messages, the sender sends message, command data and confirmation 
request using a request for extended MDN. The recipient SHOULD immediately 
returns confirmation message after the processing of image using 
extended MDN.  The confirmation message includes human readable message,
completion code, total received page, error page numbers, partial or 
full received message and capabilities of recipient. 
Capability exchange phase and message transmission and confirmation 
phase are independent, and not required to succeeded. A sender may 
perform capability exchange phase only when capabilities of the 
destination is registered in machine, and perform the message 
transmission and confirmation phase for every transmission.
A sender may not perform capability exchange phase when the transmitting
message is LCD.

5.Security considerations

The following security considerations apply when using Extended 
MDNs for Internet FAX Full Mode:



5.1 Forgery

Extended MDNs may be forged as easily as ordinary Internet 
electronic mail. User agents and Internet that wish 
to make automatic use of MDNs should take appropriate precautions 
to minimize the potential damage from denial-of-service attacks.

A SID/PWD field may be used to check the capability request.
A recipient of Internet FAX Full mode may check SID/PWD field before 
sending capability response.

5.2 Confidentiality

Another dimension of security is confidentiality.  
A recipient of Internet FAX Full mode should send MDN automatically.
MDN should be limited only capability response and confirmation.

5.3 Non-Repudiation

The Extended MDNs defined in this document provide a confirmation of 
receipt to the Internet FAX Full Mode user. The MDNs can not be relied 
upon as a guarantee that a message was or was not seen by the recipient.
