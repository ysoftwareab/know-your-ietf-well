   In addition the reader is assumed to be familiar with [RFC3945],

1. Introduction 
    
   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) [RFC3945] 
   extends MPLS to handle multiple switching technologies: packet 
   switching (PSC), layer-two switching (L2SC), TDM switching (TDM), 
   wavelength switching (LSC) and fiber switching (FSC). A GMPLS 
   switching type (PSC, TDM, etc.) describes the ability of a node to 
   forward data of a particular data plane technology, and uniquely 
   identifies a control plane region. LSP Regions are defined in 
   [RFC4206]. A network comprised of multiple switching types (e.g. PSC 
   and TDM) controlled by a single GMPLS control plane instance is 
   called a Multi-Region Network (MRN). 
    
   A data plane layer is a collection of network resources capable of 
   terminating and/or switching data traffic of a particular format. 
   For example, LSC, TDM VC-11 and TDM VC-4-64c represent three 
   different layers. A network comprising transport nodes with 
   different data plane switching layers controlled by a single GMPLS 
   control plane instance is called a Multi-Layer Network (MLN).  
    
   The applicability of GMPLS to multiple switching technologies 
   provides the unified control and operations for both LSP provisioning 
   and recovery. This document covers the elements of a single GMPLS

   control plane instance controlling multiple layers within a given TE 
   domain. A CP instance can serve one, two or more layers. Other 
   possible approaches such as having multiple CP instances serving 
   disjoint sets of layers are outside the scope of this document. 
    
   The next sections provide the procedural aspects in terms of routing 
   and signaling for such environments as well as the extensions 
   required to instrument GMPLS to provide the capabilities for MLM/MRN 
   unified control. The rationales and requirements for Multi-
   Layer/Region networks are set forth in [MLN-REQ]. These requirements 
   are evaluated against GMPLS protocols in [MLN-EVAL] and several 
   areas where GMPLS protocol extensions are required are identified. 
   This document defines GMPLS routing and signaling extensions so as 
   to cover GMPLS MLN/MRN requirements.  
    
2. Summary of the Requirements and Evaluation  
    
   As identified in [MLN-EVAL] most of MLN/MRN requirements rely on 
   mechanisms and procedures that are outside the scope of the GMPLS 
   protocols, and thus do not require any GMPLS protocol extensions. 
   They rely on local procedures and policies, and on specific TE 
   mechanisms and algorithms, which are outside the scope of GMPLS 
   protocols. 
    
   Four areas for extensions of GMPLS protocols and procedures have been 
   identified: 
    
      - GMPLS routing extension for the advertisement of the  
        internal adjustment capability of hybrid nodes. 
    
      - GMPLS signaling extension for constrained multi-region  
        signaling (SC inclusion/exclusion). 
    
      - GMPLS signaling extension for the setup/deletion of    
        Virtual TE-links (as well as exact trigger for its actual  
        provisioning). 
    
      - GMPLS routing and signaling extension for graceful TE-link  
        deletion (covered in [GR-TELINK]). 
    
   The first three requirements are addressed in Sections 3, 4 and 5, 
   respectively, of this document.  
    
   The fourth requirement is addressed in [GR-TELINK]. 
    
3. Interface adaptation capability descriptor (IACD) 
    
   In the MRN context, nodes supporting more than one switching 
   capability on at least one interface are called Hybrid nodes. Hybrid

   nodes contain at least two distinct switching elements that are 
   interconnected by internal links to provide adaptation between the 
   supported switching capabilities. These internal links have finite 
   capacities and must be taken into account when computing the path of 
   a multi-region TE-LSP. 
    
   The advertisement of the internal adaptation capability is required 
   as it provides critical information when performing multi-region path 
   computation. 
    
3.1 Overview 
    
   In an MRN environment, some LSRs could contain, under the control of 
   a single GMPLS instance, multiple switching capabilities such as PSC 
   and TDM or PSC and Lambda Switching Capability (LSC). 
    
   These nodes, hosting multiple Interface Switching Capabilities 
   (ISC), just like other nodes (hosting a single Interface Switching 
   Capability) are required to hold and advertise resource information 
   on link states and topology. They also may have to consider certain 
   portions of internal node resources to terminate hierarchical label 
   switched paths (LSPs), since circuit switch capable units such as 
   TDMs, LSCs, and FSCs require rigid resources. For example, a node 
   with PSC+LSC hierarchical switching capability can switch a Lambda 
   LSP but may not be able to can never terminate the Lambda LSP if 
   there is no unused adaptation capability between the LSC and the PSC 
   switching capabilities. 
    
   Another example occurs when L2SC (Ethernet) switching can be adapted 
   in LAPS X.86 and GFP for instance before reaching the TDM switching 
   matrix. Similar circumstances can occur, if a switching fabric that 
   supports both PSC and L2SC functionalities is assembled with LSC 
   interfaces enabling "lambda" encoding. In the switching fabric, some 
   interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and perform frame (or cell) 
   switching whilst other interfaces can terminate Lambda LSPs and 
   perform packet switching.  
    
   Therefore, within multi-region networks, the advertisement of the 
   so-called adaptation capability to terminate LSPs (not the interface 
   capability since the latter can be inferred from the bandwidth 
   available for each switching capability) provides critical 
   information to take into account when performing multi-region path 
   computation. This concept enables a node to discriminate the remote 
   nodes (and thus allows their selection during path computation) with 
   respect to their adaptation capability e.g. to terminate LSPs at the 
   PSC or LSC level.

   Hence, we introduce the idea of discriminating the (internal) 
   adaptation capability from the (interface) switching capability by 
   considering an interface adaptation capability descriptor. 
    
   A more detailed problem statement can be found in [MLN-EVAL]. 
 
3.2 Interface Adjustment Capability Descriptor (IACD) Format 
    
   The interface adjustment capability descriptor (IACD) provides the 
   information for the forwarding/switching) capability only. 
    
3.2.1 OSPF  
    
   In OSPF, the IACD sub-TLV is defined as a sub-TLV of the Link TLV 
   (see [RFC3630]), with type TBD. The IACD sub-TLV format is defined 
   as follows:

   Where:

   - second SC value (byte 3): upper switching capability  (new)  
   - second encoding value (byte 4): set to the encoding of the  
     available adaptation pool and to 0xFF when the corresponding SC    
     value has no access to the wire (i.e. there is no ISC sub-TLV for  
     this upper switching capability)  
    
   Multiple IACD sub-TLVs may be present within a given TE Link TLV  
   and the bandwidth simply provides an indication of resources still 
   available to perform insertion/ extraction for a given adjustment 
   (pool concept). 
 
3.2.2 ISIS  
    
   In IS-IS, the IACD sub-TLV is a sub-TLV of the Extended IS 
   Reachability TLV (see [RFC3784]) with type TBD. The IACD sub-TLV 
   format is defined as follows: 
    
    0                   1                   2                   3

   resources still available to perform insertion/ extraction for a 
   given adjustment (pool concept). 
    
4. Multi-Region Signaling 
    
   Section 8.2 of [RFC4206] specifies that when a region boundary node 
   receives a Path message, the node determines whether or not it is at 
   the edge of an LSP region with respect to the ERO carried in the 
   message. If the node is at the edge of a region, it must then 
   determine the other edge of the region with respect to the ERO, 
   using the IGP database. The node then extracts from the ERO the 
   subsequence of hops from itself to the other end of the region. 
    
   The node then compares the subsequence of hops with all existing FA-
   LSPs originated by the node:  
   - if a match is found, that FA-LSP has enough unreserved bandwidth  
     for the LSP being signaled, and the PID of the FA-LSP is  
     compatible with the PID of the LSP being signaled, the node uses  
     that FA-LSP as follows. The Path message for the original LSP is 
     sent to the egress of the FA-LSP. The PHOP in the message is the  
     address of the node at the head-end of the FA-LSP. Before sending  
     the Path message, the ERO in that message is adjusted by removing  
     the subsequence of the ERO that lies in the FA-LSP, and replacing  
     it with just the end point of the FA-LSP. 
   - if no existing FA-LSP is found, the node sets up a new FA-LSP.  
     That is, it initiates a new LSP setup just for the FA-LSP.   
    
   Note: compatible PID implies that traffic can be processed by both 
   ends of the FA-LSP without drop. 
    
   Applying this procedure, in a MRN environment MAY lead to setup one-
   hop FA-LSPs between each node. Therefore, considering that the path 
   computation is able to take into account richness of information with 
   regard to the SC available on given nodes belonging to the path, it 
   is consistent to provide enough signaling information to indicate the 
   SC to be used and on over which link. Particularly, in case a TE 
   link has multiple SC advertised as part of its ISCD sub-TLVs, an ERO 
   does not allow selecting a particular SC. 
    
   Limiting modifications to existing RSVP-TE procedures [RFC3473] and 
   referenced, this document defines a new sub-object of the eXclude 
   Route Object (XRO), see [RFC4874], called Switching Capability sub-
   object. This sub-object enables (when desired) the explicit 
   identification of (at least one) switching capability to be excluded 
   from the resource selection process described here above. 
    
   Including this sub-object as part of the XRO that explicitly 
   indicates which SCs have to be excluded (before initiating the 
   procedure described here above) over a specified TE link solves the

   ambiguous choice among SCs that are potentially used along a given 
   path and give the possibility to optimize resource usage on a multi-
   region basis. Note that implicit SC inclusion is easily supported by 
   explicitly excluding other SCs (e.g. to include LSC, it is required 
   to exclude PSC, L2SC, TDM and FSC). 
    
4.1 SC Subobject Encoding 
    
   The contents of an EXCLUDE_ROUTE object defined in [RFC4874] are a 
   series of variable-length data items called subobjects. This 
   document defines the SC subobject of the XRO (Type TBD), its 
   encoding and processing. 
    
   Subobject Type TBD: Switching Capability 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3

           1 indicates that the specified SC should be excluded or

             Type 2) or unnumbered interface (Type) subobject

           Switching Capability value to be excluded. 
    
   This sub-object must follow the set of numbered or unnumbered 
   interface sub-objects to which this sub-object refers. In case, of 
   loose hop ERO subobject, the XRO sub-object must precede the loose-
   hop sub-object identifying the tail-end node/interface of the 
   traversed region(s). 
    
   Furthermore, it is expected, when label sub-object are following 
   numbered or unnumbered interface sub-objects, that the label value is 
   compliant with the SC capability to be explicitly excluded.

   Two techniques can be used for the setup operation and maintenance of 
   Virtual TE links. The corresponding GMPLS protocols extensions are 
   described in this section. 
    
5.1 Edge-to-edge Association    
    
   This approach that does not require state maintenance on transit LSRs 
   relies on extensions to the GMPLS RSVP-TE Call procedure (see 
   [RFC4974]).  
    
   This technique consists of exchanging identification and TE 
   attributes information directly between TE link end points. These TE 
   link end-points correspond to the LSP head-end and tail-end points of 
   of the LSPs that will be established. The end-points MUST belong to 
   the same (LSP) region through the establishment of a call between 
   terminating LSRs. 
    
   Once the call is established the resulting association populates the 
   local TEDB and the resulting TE link is advertised as any other TE 
   link. The latter can then be used to attract traffic. Once an upper 
   layer/lower region LSP makes use of this TE link. A set of one or 
   more LSPs must be initially established before the FA LSP can be used 
   for nesting the incoming LSP. 
    
   In order to distinguish usage of such call from a classical call (as 
   defined e.g. in [RFC4139]), a CALL ATTRIBUTES object is introduced. 
    
5.1.1 CALL_ATTRIBUTES Object 
    
   The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object is used to signal attributes required in 
   support of a call, or to indicate the nature or use of a call. It is 
   built on the LSP-ATTRIBUTES object defined in [RFC4420]. 
    
   The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object class is 201 (TBD by IANA) of the form 
   11bbbbbb. This C-Num value (see [RFC2205], Section 3.10) ensures that 
   LSRs that do not recognize the object pass it on transparently.  
    
   One C-Type is defined, C-Type = 1 for CALL Attributes. This object is 
   optional and may be placed on Notify messages to convey additional 
   information about the desired attributes of the call. 
 
5.1.2 Processing 
    
   Specifically, if an egress (or intermediate) LSR does not support the 
   object, it forwards it unexamined and unchanged.  This facilitates 
   the exchange of attributes across legacy networks that do not support 
   this new object.

   The CALL_ATTRIBUTES object may be used to report call operational 
   state on a Notify message.   
 
      CALL_ATTRIBUTES class = 201, C-Type = 1 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3 
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

      |                                                               |

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
      The Attributes TLVs are encoded as described in Section 3. 
    
5.1.3 Attributes TLVs 
    
   Attributes carried by the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object are encoded within 
   TLVs. One or more TLVs may be present in each object. 
    
   There are no ordering rules for TLVs, and no interpretation should be 
   placed on the order in which TLVs are received. 
    
   Each TLV is encoded as follows. 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

      //                            Value                            // 
      |                                                               | 
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
      Type 
    
        The identifier of the TLV. 
    
      Length 
    
        The length of the Value field in bytes.  Thus, if no Value 
        field is present the Length field contains the value zero. 
        Each Value field must be zero padded at the end to take it up 
        to a four byte boundary -- the padding is not included in the 
        length so that a one byte value would be encoded in an eight 
        byte TLV with Length field set to one. 
    
      Value

         The data for the TLV padded as described above. 
    
   TLV Type 1 indicates the Attributes Flags TLV. Other TLV types may be 
   defined in the future with type values assigned by IANA (see Section 
   11.2). The Attributes Flags TLV may be present in a CALL_ATTRIBUTES 
   object.   
    
   The Attribute Flags TLV value field is an array of units of 32 flags 
   numbered from the most significant bit as bit zero. The Length field 
   for this TLV is therefore always a multiple of 4 bytes, regardless of 
   the number of bits carried and no padding is required. 
    
   Unassigned bits are considered as reserved and MUST be set to zero on 
   transmission by the originator of the object. Bits not contained in 
   the TLV MUST be assumed to be set to zero. If the TLV is absent 
   either because it is not contained in the CALL_ATTRIBUTES object or 
   because this object is itself absent, all processing MUST be 
   performed as though the bits were present and set to zero. That is to 
   say, assigned bits that are not present either because the TLV is 
   deliberately foreshortened or because the TLV is not included MUST be 
   treated as though they are present and are set to zero. 
 
5.1.4 Call inheritance Flag 
    
   This document introduces a specific flag (MSB position bit 0) of the 
   Attributes Flags TLV, to indicate that the association initiated 
   between the end-points belonging to a call results into a (virtual) 
   TE link advertisement. 
    
   The Call inheritance flag MUST be set to 1 in order to indicate that 
   the established association is to be translated into a TE link 
   advertisement. The value of this flag is by default set to 1. Setting 
   this flag to 0 results in a hidden TE link or in deleting the 
   corresponding TE link advertisement (by setting the corresponding 
   Opaque LSA Age to MaxAge). 
 
   The notify message used for establishing the association is defined 
   as per [RFC4974]. Additionally, the notify message must carry an 
   LSP_TUNNEL_INTERFACE_ID Object, that allows identifying unnumbered 
   FA-LSPs ([RFC3477], [RFC4206]) and numbered FA-LSPs ([RFC4206]). 
 
5.2. Soft FA approach                            
    
   The Soft Forwarding Adjacency (Soft FA) approach consists of setting 
   up the FA LSP at the control plane level without actually committing 
   resources in the data plane. This means that the corresponding LSP 
   exists only in the control plane domain. Once such FA is established

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-extensions-01.txt                 Feb. 2008 
 
 
   the corresponding TE link can be advertized following the procedures 
   described in [RFC4206]. 
    
   There are two techniques to setup Soft FAs: the first one consists in 
   setting up the FA LSP by precluding resource commitment during its 
   establishment. The second technique consists in making use of path 
   provisioned LSPs only. In this case, there is no associated resource 
   demand during the LSP establishment. This can be considered as the 
   RSVP-TE equivalent of the Null service type specified in [RFC2997].  
    
5.2.1 Pre-planned LSP Flag  
    
   The LSP ATTRIBUTES object and Attributes Flags TLV are defined in 
   [RFC4420]. The present document defines a new flag, the pre-planned 
   LSP Flag, in the existing Attributes Flags TLV (numbered as Type 1).  
    
   The position of this flag is TBD in accordance with IANA assignment. 
   This flag, part of the LSP_REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE object, follows 
   processing of [RFC4420] for that object. That is, LSRs that do not 
   recognize the object reject the LSP setup effectively saying that 
   they do not support the attributes requested. Indeed, the newly 
   defined attribute requires examination at all transit LSRs.   
    
   The pre-planned LSP Flag can take one of the following values: 
    
   o) When set to 0 this means that the LSP should be fully provisioned. 
   Absence of this flag (hence corresponding TLV) is therefore compliant 
   with the signaling message processing per [RFC3473]) 
    
   o) When set to 1 this means that the LSP should be provisioned in the 
   control plane only. 
    
   If an LSP is established with the pre-planned Flag set to 1, no 
   resources are committed at the data plane level. The operation of 
   committing data plane resources occurs by re-signaling the same LSP 
   with the pre-planned Flag set to 0. It is RECOMMENDED that no other 
   modifications are made to other RSVP objects during this operation. 
   That is each intermediate node, processing a Flag transiting from 1 
   to 0 shall only be concerned with the commitment of data plane 
   resources and no other modification of the LSP properties and/or 
   attributes.  
    
   If an LSP is established with the pre-planned Flag set to 0, it MAY 
   be re-signaled by setting the Flag to 1.   
    
5.2.2 Path Provisioned LSPs 
    
   There is a difference in between an LSP that is established with 0 
   bandwidth (path provisioning) and an LSP that is established with a

draft-ietf-ccamp-gmpls-mrn-extensions-01.txt                 Feb. 2008 
 
 
   certain bandwidth value not committed at the data plane level (i.e. 
   pre-planned LSP).  
    
   However, the former is currently not possible using the GMPLS 
   protocol suite (following technology specific SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC 
   definition). Indeed, Traffic Parameters such as those defined in [RFC 
   4606] do not support setup of 0 bandwidth LSPs. 
    
   Mechanisms for provisioning (pre-planned or not) LSP with 0 bandwidth  
   is straightforward for PSC the SENDER_TSPEC/FLOWSPEC, the Peak Data 
   Rate field of Int-Serv objects, see [RFC2210], is set to 0. For L2SC 
   LSP, the CIR, EIR, CBS, and EBS must be set of 0 in the Type 2 sub-
   TLV of the Ethernet Bandwidth Profile TLV. In these cases, upon LSP 
   resource commitment, actual traffic parameter values are used to 
   perform corresponding resource reservation. 
    
   For TDM and LSC LSP, a NULL Label value is used to prevent resource 
   allocation at the data plane level. In these cases, upon LSP resource 
   commitment, actual label value exchange is performed to commit 
   allocation of timeslots/wavelengths. 
    
6. Backward compatibility 
    
   New objects and procedures defined in this document are running 
   within a given TE domain. The latter is expected to run in the 
   context of a consistent TE policy. 
    
   In such TE domains, we distinguish between edge LSRs and intermediate 
   LSrs. Edge LSRs must be able to process Call Attribute as defined in 
   section 5.1 if this is method selected or creating edge-to-edge 
   associations. In that domain, intermediate LSRs are by definition 
   transparent to the Call processing.   
    
   In case the Soft FA method is used for the creation of Virtual TE 
   links, edge and intermediate LSRs must support processing of the LSP 
   ATTRIBUTE object per Section 5.2. 
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   In its current version, this memo does not introduce new security 
   consideration from the ones already detailed in the GMPLS protocol 
   suite.  
    
   The applicability of the proposed GMPLS extensions is limited to 
   single TE domain. Such domain is under the administrative authority 
   of a single entity. In this context, multi-switching layer comprised 
   within such TE domain are under the control of a single GMPLS control 
   plane instance.

   Call initiation as depicted in section 5.1, MUST strictly remain 
   under control of the TE domain administrator. To prevent any abuse of 
   Call setup, edge nodes MUST ensure isolation of their call controller 
   (i.e. the latter is not reachable via external TE domains). To 
   further prevent man-in-the-middle attack, security associations MUST 
   be established between edge nodes initiating and terminating calls. 
   For this purpose, IKE [RFC4306] MUST be used for performing mutual 
   authentication and establishing and maintaining these security 
   associations.
