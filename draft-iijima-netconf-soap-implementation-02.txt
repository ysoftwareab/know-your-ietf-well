Abstract

   NETCONF protocol is standardized to be exchanged over SSH, SOAP, or
   BEEP.  We developed a network management system based on NETCONF
   protocol.  For several reasons, we chose the SOAP protocol as a
   transport protocol of NETCONF.  This document describes why we chose
   SOAP as a transport protocol and the insight gained from actual
   development.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  NETCONF over SOAP

   In order to enable network equipment configuration automatically from
   network systems, NETCONF is designed to use XML as its description
   language since XML is easy for systems to understand.  XML is a
   suitable technology to cope with flexible specification changes, and
   it enables automatic operation.

   SOAP is also designed to use XML and is expected to become an
   indispensable technology of Web service.  For this reason, SOAP is a
   prospective technology and well suited to the NETCONF protocol.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [3].

1.3.  Motivation

   This document describes why SOAP is practical as a transport protocol
   of NETCONF in developing a network management system.  This document
   also describes the experience of implementing NETCONF over SOAP.

2.  Framework of Web service

   SOAP is considered to be an indispensable technology of Web service.
   So if we use SOAP as a transport protocol of NETCONF, network
   configuration by NETCONF is achieved on a framework of Web service.
   In this section, we describe the overall architecture of the Web
   service.

               Figure 1: Overall architecture of Web service

   As depicted in figure 1, peripheral technologies around SOAP/HTTP are
   well developed, including security technology.  For instance, WS-
   Security and WS-Transaction technology are installed on SOAP only by
   inserting particular messages in the SOAP Header.  If we do not
   choose SOAP/HTTP as a transport layer of the NETCONF protocol, we
   have to develop each surrounding technology from scratch.  Hence,
   when introducing additional technologies around SOAP, the development
   of a NETCONF-based network management system is relatively easy when
   we choose SOAP as a transport protocol of NETCONF.

2.1.  SOAP as a messaging technology

   SOAP is basically designed to use distributed objects scattered
   around the Internet regardless of platform.  Therefore, SOAP is
   developed as a messaging technology that uses standardized internet

   technology such as HTTP and XML.

   In addition, SOAP is so flexible that it is easy to incorporate other
   technologies.  For instance, the notion of session can be easily
   incorporated in SOAP by inserting a message ID into a SOAP Header.

2.2.  WSDL as an Interface Description Language

   WSDL is designed so as to bind easily with SOAP.  WSDL is an
   innovative technology for Web service since the development tool
   automatically generates interfaces to Web service by simply importing
   WSDL into the development tool.  Developers only need to customize
   the programs by putting the generated interfaces together.

   Regarding development tools that understand WSDL, useful technologies
   are available with SOAP.  For instance, Apache Axis is an interface
   generator from WSDL as well as a widely used SOAP implementation.  If
   we choose SOAP as a transport protocol, we do not need to develop
   interfaces by ourselves owing to the development tool.

3.  Insight from our Implementation

   In this section, we describe the architecture of NETCONF
   implementation using SOAP as its transport protocol.  Figure 2 is the
   architecture of the NETCONF implementation using SOAP.  In the
   following section, we explain the SOAP implementation in both a
   network management system and network equipment.

        Figure 2: Architecture of NETCONF implementation using SOAP

3.1.  SOAP implementation of the NMS

   Several SOAP implementations capable of being installed on NMS are
   available today.  For instance, Apache Axis is a practical free
   software implementation of SOAP when we choose SOAP as a transport
   protocol.  Rapid parsing in the NMS is achieved since Axis uses SAX
   as its parser.

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation                April 2007


   Also, Axis is not only a SOAP implementation but a useful tool to
   develop a network management system.  For instance, Java2WSDL, one of
   Axis's tools, can generate WSDL from Java's class file.  After we
   develop a Java library that can configure network equipment, the
   interface to network equipment can be opened to the public in a form
   of WSDL.  Another tool called WSDL2Java does the opposite.  We can
   generate a Java library from a WSDL file provided from another
   vendor.  Conclusively, various kinds of benefits can be acquired if
   we introduce Axis as a SOAP implementation.

3.1.1.  Session maintainance

   In order to enable session maintainance between NMS and network
   equipment, we used cookie as a session identifier.  After NMS sends a
   hello message to network equipment, NMS receives a newly allocated
   cookie within a hello message sent back from the network equipment.
   For the following SOAP messages exchange, NMS preserves the cookie
   paired with the network equipment's MAC address and uses the cookie
   as a session identifier.  The preserved cookie information is erased
   after the session is closed.

3.2.  SOAP implementation of network equipment

   SOAP must also be implemented in the network equipment in order to
   accept SOAP messages sent from the network management system.  Like
   the NMS, some free SOAP implementations are available.  However, in
   the case of network equipment, memory capacity might be limited.
   Therefore a memory saving method might be required when we implement
   SOAP in the network equipment.

3.2.1.  SOAP Envelope

   The SOAP Envelope is a necessary in every SOAP message.  The SOAP
   encodingStyle attribute is encouraged to be inside the Envelope
   element to indicate the serialization rules used in a SOAP message,
   but not required.

3.2.2.  SOAP Header

   The SOAP Header is defined as optional.  Therefore, when memory
   capacity in network equipment is insufficient, the module that
   processes SOAP Header can be omitted.

   The SOAPAction field is defined within the SOAP Header.  The
   SOAPAction field is designed to make developers know the intention of
   the SOAP request message.  The value is defined to be URI style.  And
   when empty string("") is put into the SOAPAction field, the intention
   of the SOAP request message is provided by the HTTP Request-URI.

Internet-Draft             SOAP implementation                April 2007


   However, if a receiver doesn't take any action by looking at
   SOAPAction field, a sender doesn't need to put any particular value
   into the SOAPAction field.

3.2.3.  SOAP Fault

   The SOAP Fault is designed to return errors to clients when a
   malfunction occurrs in servers.  However, the SOAP Fault is also
   optional, and error messages can be written in the SOAP Body as well.
   So when there are memory constraints, it is not always necessary to
   implement a SOAP Fault processor.  After all, a SOAP engine in
   network equipment is allowed to have only a SOAP Body parser.

4.  Security Considerations

   Security should be considered from two angles.  One is transport-
   level security, and the other is message-level security.  Transport-
   level security, such as encryption of entire messages, is a matter of
   SSL/TLS.  However, message-level security, such as partial encryption
   of messages or signatures, should be done by using other
   technologies.  To fulfill that need, WS-security has been defined.

   WS-Security is a Web service technology and is dependent on SOAP
   technology.  WS-Security technology can be incorporated by inserting
   XML encryption and XML signatures into the SOAP Header.

   Also, WS-Reliability achieves confirmation of sent messages and
   resending of messages.  WS-Reliability is also achieved by inserting
   particular messages into the SOAP Header.
