     Measurement of Round Trip Time and Fractional Loss Using STUN
                   draft-ietf-tram-stun-path-data-05

Abstract

   A host with multiple interfaces needs to choose the best interface
   for communication.  Oftentimes, this decision is based on a static
   configuration and does not consider the path characteristics, which
   may affect the user experience.

   This document describes a mechanism for an endpoint to measure the
   path characteristics fractional loss and RTT using Session Traversal
   Utilities for NAT (STUN) messages.

1.  Introduction

   This document extends STUN [RFC5389] to make it possible to correlate
   STUN responses to specific request when re-transmits occur.  This
   assists the client in determining path characteristics like round-
   trip time (RTT) and fractional packet loss.

   The TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute introduced in section
   Section 3.1 can be used in ICE [RFC5245] connectivity checks (STUN
   Binding request and response).  It can also be used with TURN
   [RFC5766] by adding this attribute to Allocate requests and responses
   to measure loss and RTT between the client and respective TURN
   server.

   ICE is a mechanism commonly used in VoIP applications to traverse
   NATs, and it uses a static prioritization formula to order the
   candidate pairs and perform connectivity checks, in which the most
   preferred address pairs are tested first and when a sufficiently good
   pair is discovered, that pair is used for communications and further
   connectivity tests are stopped.

   When multiple paths are available for communication, the endpoint
   sends ICE connectivity checks across each path (candidate pair).
   Choosing the path with the lowest round trip time is a reasonable

Internet-Draft           RTT and Fractional Loss             August 2016


   approach, but re-transmits can cause an otherwise good path to appear
   flawed.  However, STUN's retransmission algorithm [RFC5389] cannot
   determine the round-trip time (RTT) if a STUN request packet is re-
   transmitted, because each request and retransmission packet is
   identical.  Further, several STUN requests may be sent before the
   connectivity between candidate pairs are ascertained (see Section 16
   of [RFC5245]).  To resolve the issue of identical request and
   response packets in a STUN transaction, this document changes the
   retransmission behavior for idempotent packets.  In addition to
   determining RTT, it is also possible to get a hint regarding which
   path direction caused packet loss.  This is achieved by defining a
   new STUN attribute and requires compliant STUN (TURN, ICE) endpoints
   to count request packets.

   The mechanisms described in this document can be used by the
   controlling agent to influence the ICE candidate pair selection.  How
   ICE actually will use this information to improve the active
   candidate pair selection is outside the scope of this document.

2.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   This specification uses terminology defined in ICE [RFC5245] and STUN
   [RFC5389].

3.  Measuring RTT and Fractional Loss

   This document defines a new comprehension-optional STUN attribute
   TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER with a STUN Type TBD-CA.  This type is
   in the comprehension-optional range, which means that STUN agents can
   safely ignore the attribute.  If ICE is in use it will fallback to
   normal procedures.

   If a client wishes to measure RTT, it inserts the
   TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute in a STUN request.  In this
   attribute the client sends the number of times the STUN request is
   transmitted with the same Transaction ID.  The server would echo back
   the transmission count in the response so that client can distinguish
   between STUN responses coming from re-transmitted requests.  Hence,
   the endpoint can use the STUN requests and responses to determine the
   round-trip time (RTT).  The server may also convey the number of
   responses it has sent for the STUN request to the client.  Further,
   this information enables the client to get a hint regarding what
   direction the packet loss occurred.  In some cases, it is impossible
   to distinguish between packet reordering and packet loss.  However if

   this information is collected as network metrics from several clients
   over a longer time period, it will be easier to detect a pattern that
   can provide useful information.

3.1.  TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute

   The TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute in a STUN request takes a
   32-bit value.  This document updates one of the STUN message
   structuring rules explained in Section 6 of [RFC5389] wherein
   retransmit of the same request reuse the same transaction ID and are
   bit-wise identical to the previous request.  For idempotent packets,
   the Req and Resp fields in the TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute
   will be incremented by 1 by the client or server for every
   transmission with the same transaction id.  Any re-transmitted STUN
   request MUST be bit-wise identical to the previous request except for
   the values in the TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute.

   The IANA assigned STUN type for the new attribute is TBD-CA.

   The format of the value in TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute in
   the request is:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |        Reserved (Padding)     |    Req        |     Resp      |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


        Figure 1: TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute in request

   The fields is described below:

   Req:  Number of times request is transmitted with the same
      transaction ID to the server.

   Resp:  Number of times a response with the same transaction ID is
      sent from the server.  MUST be set to zero in requests and ignored
      by the receiver.

   The padding is necessary to hit the 32-bit boundary needed for STUN
   attributes.  The padding bits are ignored, but to allow for future
   reuse of these bits they MUST be set to 0.

3.2.  Usage in Requests

   When sending a STUN request, the TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER
   Attribute allows a client to indicate to the server that it wants to
   measure RTT and get a hint of the direction of any packet loss.

   The client MUST populate the Req value in the
   TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER.  This value MUST reflect the number of
   requests that have been transmitted to the server.  Initial value for
   the first request sent is therefore 1.  The first re-transmit will
   set the value to 2 and so on.

   The Resp filed in the attribute MUST be set to zero in the request.

3.3.  Usage in Responses

   When a server receives a STUN request that includes a
   TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute, it processes the request as
   per the STUN protocol [RFC5389] plus the specific rules mentioned
   here.  The server checks the following:

   o  If the TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute is not recognized,
      ignore the attribute because its type indicates that it is
      comprehension- optional.  This should be the existing behavior as
      explained in section 3.1 of [RFC5389].

   o  The server that supports TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute
      MUST echo back the Req field in the response using a
      TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute.

   o  If the server is stateless or does not want to remember the
      transaction ID then it would populate value 0 for the Resp field
      in TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute sent in the response.
      If the server is stateful then it populates the Resp field with
      the number of responses it has sent for the STUN request.

   A client that receives a STUN response with a
   TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER can check the values in the Req field to
   accurately calculate the RTT if retransmits are occurring.

   If the server sending the STUN response is stateless the value of the
   Resp field will always be 0.  If the server keeps state of the
   numbers of STUN request with that same transaction id the value will
   reflect how many packets the server have seen and responded to.  This
   gives the client a hint of which direction loss occurred.  See
   section Section 3.4 for more details.

3.4.  Example Operation

   Example operation, when a server is stateful, is described in
   Figure 2.  In the first case, all the requests and responses are
   received correctly.

   In the upstream loss case, the first request is lost, but the second
   one is received correctly, the client on receiving the response notes
   that while 2 requests were sent, only one was received by the server.
   The server also realizes that the value in the Req field does not
   match the number of received requests, therefore 1 request was lost.
   This may also occur at startup in the presence firewalls or NATs that
   block unsolicited incoming traffic.

   In the downstream loss case, the responses get lost, client expecting
   multiple responses, notes that while the server responded to 3
   requests but only 1 response was received.

   In the both loss case, requests and responses get lost in tandem, the
   server notes one request packet was not received, while the client
   expecting 3 responses received only one, it notes that one request
   and response packets were lost.

   |     Normal    |  Upstream loss | Downstream loss |     Both loss |
   | Client Server |  Client Server |  Client  Server | Client Server |
   |+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-|
   | 1        1,1  |  1        x    |  1         1,1  |  1        x   |
   |   1,1         |                |    x            |               |
   |               |  2        2,1  |  2         2,2  |  2        2,1 |
   |               |    2,1         |    x            |    x          |
   |               |                |  3         3,3  |  3        3,2 |
   |               |                |    3,3          |    3,2        |


         Figure 2: Retransmit Operation between client and Server

   Another example could be the client sends two requests but the second
   request arrives at the server before the first request because of out
   of order delivery.  In this case, the stateful server populates value
   1 for the Resp field in TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute sent
   in response to the second request and value 2 for the Resp field in
   TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute sent in response to the first
   request.

   The intention with this mechanism is not to carry out comprehensive
   and accurate measurements regarding in what direction loss is
   occurring.  In some cases, it might not be able to distinguish the
   difference between downstream loss and packet reordering.

4.  IANA Considerations

   [Paragraphs in braces should be removed by the RFC Editor upon
   publication]

   [The TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute requires that IANA
   allocate a value in the "STUN attributes Registry" from the
   comprehension-optional range (0x8000-0xBFFF), to be replaced for TBD-
   CA throughout this document]

   This document defines the TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER STUN
   attribute, described in Section 3.  IANA has allocated the
   comprehension-optional codepoint TBD-CA for this attribute.

5.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in [RFC5389] are to be taken into
   account.  STUN requires the 96 bits transaction ID to be uniformly
   and randomly chosen from the interval 0 .. 2**96-1, and be
   cryptographically strong.  This is good enough security against an
   off-path attacker.  An on-path attacker can either inject a fake
   response or modify the values in TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER
   attribute to mislead the client and server.  This attack can be
   mitigated using STUN authentication.  As TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER
   is expected to be used between peers using ICE, and ICE uses STUN
   short-term credential mechanism the risk of on-path attack
   influencing the messages is minimal.  If TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER
   is used with Allocate request then STUN long-term credential
   mechanism or STUN Extension for Third-Party Authorization [RFC7635]
   or (D)TLS connection can be used between the TURN client and the TURN
   server to prevent attackers from trying to impersonate a TURN server
   and sending bogus TRANSACTION_TRANSMIT_COUNTER attribute in the
   Allocate response.  However, an attacker could corrupt, remove, or
   delay an ICE request or response, in order to discourage that path
   from being used.

   The information sent in any STUN packet if not encrypted can
   potentially be observed passively and used for reconnaissance and
   later attacks.
