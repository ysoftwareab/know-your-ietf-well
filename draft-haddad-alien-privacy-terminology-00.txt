Abstract

   This memo introduces the terminology for the main privacy 
   aspects. The prime goal is to avoid situations where different 
   interpretations of the same key privacy aspects result in 
   different requirements when designing specific solutions, thus 
   leading to an unnecessary confusion.

1. Introduction


   Privacy is becoming a key requirement to allow deployment of
   specific internet services. However, privacy has many aspects,
   which differ in scope, properties and limitations.
 
   To avoid any possible confusion with regard to the meanings of 
   privacy in some particular scenarios and to differentiate 
   between requirements related to each scenario, privacy aspects
   have to be well defined before designing any solution. It is 
   the intention of this memo to introduce the terminology for the 
   main aspects of privacy.

3. General Terminology


   Item of Interest (IOI)

      An Item of Interest (IOI) represents what an attacker is 
      trying to discover, learn, trace and possibly link to other 
      IOI(s), in order to identify its target. 
      Examples of IOI include a subject, event, action (e.g.,
      send, receive, move, etc), specific type of messages,...

 
   Knowledge

      In the field of privacy, knowledge refers to the information 
      available to an attacker about its target. In terms of IOI, 
      knowledge can be described by the probability of one or more
      IOIs.
      We refer to any prior information available to an attacker 
      about a specific target as background knowledge.  

 

4. Privacy


   Privacy is a fundamental human right. The most common 
   definition of privacy is the one by Alan Westin: "Pivacy is 
   the claim of individuals, groups and institutions to determine 
   for themesleves, when, how and to what extent information about 
   them is communicated to others".

   Privacy is a general term that involves several different 
   aspects. These aspects enable features like hiding the node's 
   address(es) (e.g., MAC and/or IP), name(s) (e.g., DNS), and/or 
   location(s), in addition to hiding specific IOIs. One or more 
   of these features can be obtained during one particular 
   session. 

   In wireless telecommunications, privacy addresses especially 
   the protection of the content as well as the context (e.g., 
   time, location, type of service, ...) of a communication event.

   Consequently, neither the mobile node nor its system software 
   shall support the creation of user-related usage profiles. Such 
   profiles basically comprise of a correlation of time and 
   location of the node's use, as well as the type and details of 
   the transaction performed.

   The main privacy aspects are the anonymity, unlinkability,

INTERNET-DRAFT                Privacy Terminology           October 2005



   unobservability and pseudonymity. Note that privacy can even be
   achieved by disconnectivity, i.e., not being connected to a 
   network.



5. Location Privacy


   Location privacy is the ability to prevent other parties from
   learning one's current and/or past location. In order to get 
   such ability, the concerned (i.e., targeted :) node must 
   conceal any relation between its location and the personal 
   identifiable information. 

   In our context, location privacy refers normally to the
   topological location and not the geographic one. The latter is
   provided by other means (e.g., GPS) than an IPv6 address. But 
   it should be noted that it may be possible sometimes to deduce
   the geographical location from the topological one.



6. Privacy Aspects


   As mentioned above, privacy is a general term, which refers to
   many different aspects. In the following, we define the main
   privacy aspects and describe the different relations between
   them.



6.1. Anonymity


   Anonymity is the state of being not uniquely characterized, 
   i.e., identifiable, within a set of subjects (e.g., node, 
   user) called the anonymity set. The set of possible subjects 
   depends on the knowledge of the attacker and may vary over 
   time. Thus, anonymity is relative with respect to the attacker 
   and is very much context dependent.    

   In the security field, anonymity is a property of network 
   security. An entity "A" in a set has anonymity if no other 
   entity can identify "A", nor is there any link back to "A" 
   that can be used, nor any way to verify that any two anonymous 
   act are performed by "A".

   From a user perspective, anonymity ensures that a user may use



Haddad, Nordmark              Expires March 2006                [Page 4]

INTERNET-DRAFT                Privacy Terminology           October 2005


 
   a resource or service without disclosing the user's identity.

   In wireless networks, anonymity means that neither the mobile
   node nor its system shall by default expose any information, 
   that allows any conclusions on the owner or current use of the 
   node.    
   
   Consequently, in scenarios where a device and/or network
   identifiers are used (e.g., MAC address, IP address), neither 
   the communication partner nor any outside attacker should be 
   able to disclose any possible link between the respective 
   identifier and the user's identity.



6.2. Unlinkability


   Unlinkability of two or more IOIs means that from an 
   attacker's perspective, these IOIs are no more and no less 
   related after his observation than they are related 
   concerning his background knowledge.

   For example, two messages (e.g., binding updates) are 
   unlinkable for an attacker if the a-posteriori probability 
   describing his background knowledge that these two messages 
   are sent by the same sender and/or received by the same 
   recipient is the same as the probability imposed by his 
   a-priori knowledge.

   From a user perspective, unlinkability ensures that a user 
   may make multiple uses of resources or services without 
   other being able to link these uses together.



6.3. Unobservability


   Unobservability is the state of IOIs being indistinguishable
   from any IOI. This means that messages are not discernable 
   from e.g., random noise. Consequently, unobservability deals
   with events instead of subjects. 

   From a user perspective, unobservability ensures that a user
   may use a resource or service without others, especially 
   third parties, being able to observe that the resource or
   service is being used.

6.4. Relation between Anonymity and Unlinkability


   In terms of unlinkability, anonymity can be defined as the 
   unlikability of an IOI and any identifier of a subject. 
   Consequently, unlinkability is a sufficient condition of
   anonymity but is not a necessary condition. 



6.5. Pseudonymity
 

   Pseudonymity is a weaker property related to anonymity. It 
   means that one cannot identify an entity, but it may be
   possible to prove that two pseudonyms acts were performed by 
   the same entity.

   From a user perspective, pseudonymity ensures that a user 
   may use a resource or service without disclosing its user 
   identity, but can still be accountable for that use.

   Consequently, a pseudonym is an identifier for a party to a
   transaction, which is not in the normal course of events, 
   sufficient to associate the transaction with a particular 
   user.

   Hence a transaction is pseudonymous in relation to a 
   particular party if the transaction data contains no direct 
   identifier for that party, and can only be related to them in 
   the event that a very specific piece of additional data is 
   associated with it.
