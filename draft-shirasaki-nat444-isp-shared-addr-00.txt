Abstract

   This document describes a network model with ISP Shared Address and
   Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) called NAT444.  NAT444 is the only scheme not

   to require replacing Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) even if IPv4
   address exhausted.  But it must be noted that NAT444 has serious
   restrictions i.e. it limits the number of sessions per CPE so that
   rich applications such as AJAX and RSS feed cannot work well.
   Therefore, IPv6 which is free from such a difficulty has to be
   introduced into the network at the same time.  In other words, NAT444
   is just a tool to make IPv6 transition easy to be swallowed.  It is
   designed for the days IPv4 and IPv6 co-existence.

Internet-Draft       NAT444 with ISP Shared Address         October 2008


1.  Introduction

   IPv4 address is said to be run out soon.  Unless ISP takes any
   action, it will not be able to provide the service to new customers.

   This document explains a NAT444 model.  This model is base on the
   environment where customers have been using Private Address [RFC1918]
   inside their CPE, and the servers that have only IPv4 address will
   continue to exist on the Internet after the IPv4 address exhaustion.

   In this situation, IPv6 only hosts cannot reach IPv4 only hosts.

   It triggers ISPs to take actions for keeping assigning IPv4 address
   to their customers using non-Global IPv4 Address.  NAT444 is one of
   the solutions for this issue.


2.  Definition of NAT444 Model

   NAT444 Model is a network model that uses two Network Address and
   Port Translators (NAPTs) with three types of IPv4 address blocks.

   The first NAPT is in CPE, and the second NAPT is in Carrier Grade NAT
   (CGN) [I-D.nishitani-cgn].  CGN is supposed to be installed in the
   ISP's network.

   The first IPv4 address block is Private Address inside CPE.  The
   second one is a IPv4 Address block between CPEs and CGN.  It could be
   Global Address, Private Address (10/8), Class-E (240/4)
   [I-D.wilson-class-e], or (newly defined) ISP Shared Address.  The
   third one is IPv4 Global Addresses that is outside CGN and directly
   connected to the IPv4 Internet.

3.  Pros and Cons of NAT444 Model

3.1.  Pros of NAT444 Model

   This network model has following advantages.

   - This is the only network model that doesn't require replacing CPEs
   those are owned by customers.
   - This network model is composed of the present technology.
   - This model doesn't require address family translation.
   - This model doesn't require DNS rewriting.

3.2.  Cons of NAT444 Model

   This network model has some technical restrictions.

   - Some application such as SIP and FTP requires special treatment,
   because IP address is written in the payload of the packet.  Special
   treatment means application itself aware double NAPT or both of two
   NAPTs support inspecting and rewriting the packets.
   - Because both IPv4 route and IPv6 route exist, it doubles the number
   of IGP route inside the CGN.
   - UPnP doesn't work with double NAPTs.


4.  Address Block of ISP's Network

   The address block mentioned in this section is the one between CPE
   and CGN.  The best address block is "ISP Shared Address" which is
   defined in [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr] and briefly described in
   this section.

4.1.  Global Address

   ISP cannot assign IPv4 Global Address any more after the exhaustion.

4.2.  Private Address

   It has two major problems.

4.2.1.  Hairpining Issue

   If both source and destination address of the packet are inside CGN,
   it has to go through CGN.  The reason is that some servers reject
   receiving packets when the source address of receiving packet is
   Private Address.  Therefore packets have to go through the CGN for
   rewriting the source address from Private Address to Global Address.
   Additionally, if Private Address and Global Address co-exist inside



Shirasaki, et al.        Expires April 30, 2009                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       NAT444 with ISP Shared Address         October 2008


   CGN, ISP has to use Policy Based Routing (PBR).

4.2.2.  Address Block Duplication Issue

   The Private Address in ISP's network could conflict with its
   customer's network address.  Most CPEs between customer's network and
   ISP's network cannot route the packet under this situation.  To avoid
   this, ISP has to negotiate with its all customers not to use the
   reserved Private Address block.

4.3.  Class-E Address (240/4)

   It is known that some equipment such as routers and servers reject
   packets from or to this address block.  So, to use this address block
   in ISP's network, ISP has to request its customers to replace their
   equipment.  In addition to that, ISP might have to replace their
   equipment when it doesn't handle Class-E address packets properly.

4.4.  ISP Shared Address

   ISP Shared Address is the newly defined IPv4 address block that is to
   be allocated from IANA free pool.  It doesn't have any problem.
   Spending some blocks from the exhausting IANA free pool could be
   regarded as a problem, but from long view, this problem is much
   smaller than its great merit.  ISP Shared Address is defined in
   [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr]

   Thanks for the input and review by Shirou Niinobe, Takeshi Tomochika,
   Tomohiro Fujisaki, Dai Nishino, JP address community members, AP
   address community members and JPNIC members.


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is to allocate a certain size of address block from IANA free
   pool.  The size of it is described in [I-D.shirasaki-isp-shared-addr]


7.  Security Considerations

   Each customer inside a CGN looks using the same Global Address. from
   outside an ISP.  In case of incidents, the ISP must have the function
   to trace back the record of each customer's access without using only
   IP address.

   If a Global Address of the CGN is listed on the blacklist, other
   customers who share the same address could be affected.

Appendix A.  Example IPv6 Transition Scenario

   The steps of IPv6 transition are as follows.

   Step 1: Enabling softwire client in host

   ISP provides IPv6 connectivity to customers with softwire [RFC4925].
   ISP installs CGN and softwire concentrator in its network.  A
   softwire client in host connects to the IPv6 internet via ISP's
   concentrator.  ISP can use existing IPv4 equipments.  Customers can
   just use existing CPE.

   Step 2: Enabling softwire client in CPE

   A customer enables softwire client in CPE.  A softwire client in CPE
   connects to the IPv6 internet via ISP's concentrator.  A Customer's
   network is now dual stack.

Appendix B.  Example Architectures

   This section explains example architectures how to design NAT444 with
   ISP Shared Address.

B.1.  Direct Routing inside CGN

   This architecture enables direct communication between customers
   inside same CGN.  It has the following advantages.

   - The packets don't go through CGN.  (No hairpining)
   - The customers inside CGN can use bidirectional applications (e.g.
   TV Conference, VPN).
   - No need to use Policy Based Routing.

B.2.  CGN Bypassing

   This architecture is bypassing the NAT function of CGN.  It has the
   following advantage.

   - The customers inside an ISP can use bidirectional applications
   (e.g.  TV Conference, VPN).
   -Any communication in single ISP doesn't consume CGN external port.
   -ISP's servers outside CGN can access CPE. (e.g.  ICMP echo, SNMP,
   remote access)
   -ISP's servers outside CGN can distinguish which customer's
   connection it receives. (e.g.  DNS, Mail)

B.3.  Global Address Customers inside CGN

   This architecture enables co-existing Global Address and ISP Shared
   Address inside CGN.

   It enables direct communications from ISP Shared Address customer to
   Global Address customer inside same CGN.  It has the following
   advantage.

   - The ISP can put ISP Shared Address customer and Global Address
   customer in the same concentrator.
   - The packets don't go through CGN.  (No hairpining)

   - The customers inside CGN can use bidirectional applications (e.g.
   TV Conference, VPN).
   - No need to use Policy Based Routing.
