     Abstract 
         
        This document defines an IPv6 Provider-Independent global unicast 
        address format for use in the Internet.  The address format defined 
        in this document is consistent with the IPv6 Protocol [2] and the 
        "IPv6 Addressing Architecture" [3].  It is designed to facilitate 
        scalable Internet routing when sites attach to multiple service 
        providers, by using a prefix based on a geographic reference to the 
        site. A natural byproduct of this address allocation mechanism is 
        that all addresses are fixed allowing sites to change providers at 
        will without requiring their network to renumber.

     Introduction 
         
        This document defines a Provider-Independent global unicast address 
        format for IPv6 address assignments. The companion document [5] 
        discusses the appropriate use of this address format. The mechanism 
        defined here breaks down the geographic location of the site into 
        prefix lengths that map well into existing routing protocols. It is 
        not proposing that routers know about geography, but that a prefix 
        that routers know how to deal with be constructed out of something 
        readily available which uniquely identifies the physical-media 
        (layer-1) demarcation point between the public Internet and a site.  
         
        The Provider-Independent format explicitly isolates a multi-homed 
        site's address prefix from the set of providers it is connected to. 
        As a concession to operational simplicity, the format optimizes the 
        operational issue of identifying the demarcation point as a direct 
        trade-off against the known consumption of address space assigned to 
        uninhabitable regions. The overall goal is to allow efficient 
        routing aggregation for single sites that connect directly to 
        multiple providers or to metropolitan scale exchanges. Sites will 
        have the choice to connect to either or both types of service. The 
        details about specific site topology will be limited to the service

                                  Address Format 
      
        providers that are making the direct connections, and traffic will 
        follow the shortest path from the perspective of the current source.  
         
        This format is expected to work well for organizations with multiple 
        sites distributed geographically when used concurrently with address 
        selection rules [6]. As each end system will select from its 
        available source set the address that has the longest match with any 
        particular destination, response packets from Provider-Independent 
        destination sites will naturally find the source network demarcation 
        point with the public Internet that is closest to the destination 
        site. While this does not assure symmetry, it does help localize any 
        differences. 
         
        The basic mechanism is an Earth surface location defined by WGS-84 
        [7] latitude and longitude which represents the center of a nominal 
        square ~10m on a side. (WGS-84 was selected because low-cost hand-
        held devices with the necessary level of accuracy on a global scale 
        are readily available.) Interleaving is used to create a 44-bit 
        reference value from the 22-bit values corresponding to each side of 
        the grid. Dropping the low order nibbles increases flexibility of 
        assignments to sites and allows for local management by expanding 
        the grid scope. 
         
        Addresses defined with the Provider-Independent format prefix (IANA 
        assigned, recommendation to use 0001) are by definition NOT-PORTABLE 
        when a network attachment point changes geographic locations. 
        Entities that expect identifiers to be portable across physical 
        location moves MUST use alternatives such as Provider-Aggregatable 
        addresses or DNS names. Multi-site organizations SHOULD be using an 
        appropriate set of the available prefixes (see companion document 
        [5] for usage discussions), allowing movement of any specific 
        facility without impacting all communications.  
         
        While this format is based on geographic location, it does not 
        require renumbering devices as they move around within a network. 
        The only time a renumbering event MAY be required is when the 
        network is large enough that the demarcation point to the public 
        Internet changes. If the local jurisdiction remains the same (ie: 
        the demarcation point is simply moving between buildings occupied by 
        the same company) the prefix is MAY be left unchanged until the 
        occupant of the space defining the prefix changes. 
         
        ** Geography provides distinguished meaning to the term 'home 
        address'. One possibility would be for all nodes to use Mobile-IPv6 
        [8] with the PI as home and whatever current provider as care-of.

                                  Address Format 
      
         
     Overview of the IPv6 Address 
         
        IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and sets of 
        interfaces. There are three types of addresses: Unicast, Anycast, 
        and Multicast. This document defines a specific type of Unicast    
        address. 
         
        In this document, fields in addresses are given specific names, for    
        example "subnet". When this name is used with the term "ID" (for    
        "identifier") after the name (e.g., "subnet ID"), it refers to the    
        contents of the named field. When it is used with the term "prefix" 
        (e.g. "subnet prefix") it refers to all of the addressing bits to    
        the left of and including this field.  
         
        IPv6 unicast addresses are designed assuming that the Internet    
        routing system makes forwarding decisions based on a "longest prefix    
        match" algorithm on arbitrary bit boundaries and does not have any    
        knowledge of the internal structure of IPv6 addresses. The structure 
        in IPv6 addresses is for assignment and allocation. The only 
        exception to this is the distinction made between unicast and 
        multicast addresses. Due to the relationship between physical 
        location of routers, geography, and human readability there MAY be a 
        tendency to manage the routers so that they make forwarding 
        decisions on nibble boundaries, but there is nothing in the format 
        requiring that. Each router will need to be configured to forward 
        based on a prefix length appropriate for the context of a specific 
        topology. 
         
        The specific type of an IPv6 address is indicated by the leading 
        bits in the address.  The variable-length field comprising these 
        leading bits is called the Format Prefix (FP). 
         
        This document defines an address format for the xxxx (IANA assigned) 
        (binary) Format Prefix for Provider-Independent geographic reference 
        global unicast addresses. The same address format could be used for 
        other Format Prefixes, as long as these Format Prefixes also 
        identify IPv6 unicast addresses.  Only the "xxxx (IANA assigned)" 
        Format Prefix is defined here. 
         
         
     IPv6 Provider-Independent Global Unicast Address Format 
         
        Provider-Independent address prefixes use a geographic reference 
        derived from a bit interleave of the WGS-84 based latitude and 
        longitude of the demarcation point of a site. The resulting 44-bit 
        field provides a resolution grid of approximately 10 meters on a 
        side. While the prefix length MAY be routed on any bit boundary, the 
        requirement for all service providers serving any short prefix 
        boundary scope to be capable of delivering traffic to all others, 
        will have a tendency to naturally limit the operational choices.

                                  Address Format 
      
        This document specifies the format for format prefix (FP) (IANA 
        assigned, recommendation to use 0001)  binary. 
         
        | 4 |            44           |   16   |          64 bits          |

        +---+-------------------------+--------+---------------------------+ 
         
         
        Creating the Provider-Independent address prefix is accomplished by 
        dividing the WGS-84 latitude and longitude readings in degrees (for 
        latitudes between +/- 15 degrees measured to 5 places right of the 
        decimal ie: deg.xxxxx) by the incremental angle. For 22-bit values 
        the incremental angle is 0.0000858306884765625 degrees (360/(2^22)). 
        This will result in uniquely identifiable areas with 2096832 along 
        the latitude axis and 4193664 along the longitude axis. The specific 
        sequence for address formation is: 
        1. for east/west : convert all values to east (ie: 90w = 270e) 
        2. divide demarcation degree values by 0.0000858306884765625 
        3. convert each of the integers to 22-digit binary 
        4. for north/south (set MSB for south) 
        5. bit interleave latitude, longitude into 44-bit result  
        6. prepend FP xxxx (IANA assigned) to form 48-bit prefix 
         
         
     Examples 
         
        The examples in the tables below highlight the difficulty of 
        aligning technical details of bit patterns with human meaningful 
        text strings. A specific instance is the fact is that there are at 
        least 2 prefix announcements (covering each side of the meridian) 
        for the text string matching the political entity known as 'West 
        Europe'. One of the explicit goals of the first table is to identify 
        the very large nibble-based scopes devoid of geo-political context, 
        while recognizing the need to provide something that an operator can 
        relate to as the resolution becomes finer grained. In any case these 
        are only examples, and actual implementations would be based on 
        engineering requirements. 
         
        The Reference field in the prefix MUST be calculated for a site at 
        44-bits, but MAY be used in routing calculations on any bit boundary 
        appropriate for the topology. For human reference the approximate 
        surface area covered by each 4-bit value of the grid is provided in 
        the table below. The size in meters is based on rounded values for 
        the equatorial circumference and should only be used as a conceptual 
        guideline.

                   An IPv6 Provider-Independent Global Unicast    March 2002

     Site-Level Aggregation Identifier 
         
        The SLA ID field is used by an individual organization to create its 
        own local addressing hierarchy and to identify subnets.  This is 
        analogous to subnets in IPv4 except that each organization has a 
        much greater number of subnets.  The 16-bit SLA ID field supports 
        65,535 individual subnets. 
         
        Organizations may choose to either route their SLA ID "flat" (e.g., 
        not create any logical relationship between the SLA identifiers that 
        results in larger routing tables), or to create a two or more level 
        hierarchy (that results in smaller routing tables) in the SLA ID 
        field.  The latter is shown as follows: 
         
           |  n  |   16-n     |              64 bits                | 
           +-----+------------+-------------------------------------+ 
           |SLA1 |   Subnet   |            Interface ID             | 
           +-----+------------+-------------------------------------+ 
         
                 | m  |16-n-m |              64 bits                | 
                 +----+-------+-------------------------------------+ 
                 |SLA2|Subnet |            Interface ID             | 
                 +----+-------+-------------------------------------+ 
         
        The approach chosen for structuring an SLA ID field is the 
        responsibility of the individual organization. 
         
        The number of subnets supported by this address format should be 
        sufficient for all foreseeable multi-homing uses. When the number of 
        multi-homed subnets exceeds 2 ^ 16 per 100 square meters of the 
        earth's surface, alternative allocation mechanisms may be required.  
         
     Interface ID 
         
        Interface identifiers are used to identify interfaces on a link. 
        They are required to be unique on that link.  They may also be 
        unique over a broader scope.  In many cases an interfaces identifier 
        will be the same or be based on the interface's link-layer address. 
        Interface IDs used in the Provider-Independent global unicast 
        address format are required to be 64 bits long and to be constructed 
        in IEEE EUI-64 format [9].  These identifiers may have global scope 
        when a global token (e.g., IEEE 48bit MAC) is available or may have 
        local scope where a global token is not available (e.g., serial 
        links, tunnel end-points, etc.).  The "u" bit (universal/local bit 
        in IEEE EUI-64 terminology) in the EUI-64 identifier must be set 
        correctly, as defined in [3], to indicate global or local scope. 
         
        The procedures for creating EUI-64 based Interface Identifiers is 
        defined in [3].  The details on forming interface identifiers is 
        defined in the appropriate "IPv6 over " specification such as "IPv6 
        over Ethernet" [10], "IPv6 over FDDI" [11], etc.

                   An IPv6 Provider-Independent Global Unicast    March 2002 
                                  Address Format 
      
         
         
     Technical Motivation 
         
        The design choice for the size of the fields in the Provider-
        Independent geographic address format was based on the need to 
        separate the address allocation from the service provider 
        (specifically to address the scaling problems that mechanism creates 
        when sites connect to multiple providers), and the need to preserve 
        the subnet structure defined in [12]. Additional benefits of 
        separation are the ability of the site to switch providers without 
        renumbering, and the ability of transport connections to survive 
        loss of connection to one of the site's providers. 
         
        Multi-site networks are expected to internally advertise all the 
        appropriate natural prefixes and let the [6] rules sort it out. This 
        would result in systems selecting a source address that most closely 
        matches the destination. Thus return traffic would naturally be 
        directed toward the boundary site closest to the destination site 
        (ie: traffic would traverse the public network as little as 
        possible). 
         
         
         
     General Considerations 
         
        The policy considerations :  about when it is appropriate to use 
        this address format are discussed in the companion document [5].  
         
        The operational considerations : of human readability in the routing 
        prefix lengths versus the topology realities used by the routing 
        system are network dependent and outside the scope of this document.  
         
        The technical considerations : the accuracy of the WGS-84 location 
        reading versus the margin of error for a 22-bit resolution. When 
        available, 5 places of significance right of decimal in lat/long 
        readings results in 1 m increment, or well within rounding error of 
        22 bit resolution : while between +/- 15 degrees latitude, using 
        only 4 places of significance results in 11.1 m increments which is 
        longer than the side ~ 9.5 m of the grid being identified. 
        (Currently available consumer-grade GPS receivers are generally 
        accurate to only 4 places.) 
        Alignment of the site boundary supporting SLA with the [12] format 
        allows sites to use a consistent subnet structure. 
         
         
     IANA Considerations 
         
        A 4-bit format prefix for PI address use needs to be assigned. The 
        format prefix 0001 is recommended to avoid breaking up any of the 
        unassigned 3-bit spaces.

     RFC Editor Considerations 
         
        The format prefix X in the examples needs to be replaced by the 
        value assigned by IANA.  
         
     Security Considerations 
      
        While there may be concerns about location privacy raised by this 
        scheme, there is nothing inherent in this address format that would 
        raise any more security considerations than any other global 
        addressing format. If location privacy were an issue it would be 
        wise to avoid this mechanism in favor of location independent 
        mechanisms such as Provider-Aggregatable [12] allocations.
