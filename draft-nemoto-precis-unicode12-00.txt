                  PRECIS Framework and Unicode 12.0.0
                    draft-nemoto-precis-unicode12-00

Abstract

   This document describes the changes between Unicode 6.3.0 and Unicode
   12.0.0 in the context of PRECIS in the same way as draft-faltstrom-
   unicode12-00.  This document provides the information needed to
   consider whether the PRECIS framework can follow the updates of the
   Unicode standard since Unicode 6.3.0.

1.  Introduction

   Preparation and Comparison of Internationalized Strings (PRECIS)
   framework [RFC8264] defines two classes of strings for use in
   application protocols.  One is IdentifierClass, which classifies
   characters suitable for character strings group such as user IDs, and
   the other is FreeformClass, which classifies characters suitable for
   character strings group such as passwords.  The classification of
   character code points for each class is defined by derived property
   values calculated based on properties defined in the Unicode
   standard.  This values are registered in the IANA registry as PRECIS
   Derived Property Value (https://www.iana.org/assignments/precis-
   tables-6.3.0/).  However as explained in Section 11.1 of RFC 8264
   [RFC8264], this registry not be updated to Unicode 7.0.0 until the
   issues described in IAB-Statement [IAB] and Section 13.5 of RFC 8264
   [RFC8264] is resolved.  On the other hand, Internationalized Domain
   Names for Applications (IDNA2008) [RFC5890] [RFC5891] [RFC5892]
   [RFC5893] [RFC5894] [RFC5895] which had similar problems, was
   considered by experts and the IDNA Parameters registry of derived
   property values was updated.  This document provides the information
   needed to consider whether the PRECIS framework can follow the
   updates of the Unicode standard since Unicode 6.3.0 by reference to
   draft-faltstrom-unicode12-00 [I-D.faltstrom-unicode12].

2.  Keywords for Requirement Levels

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

3.  Overview of Changes Between Unicode 6.3.0 and 12.0.0

3.1.  Changes between Unicode 6.3.0 and 7.0.0

   Change in number of chacters in each category:

      PVALID changed from 98,999 to 100,969 (+1,970)

      UNASSIGNED changed from 864,343 to 861,509 (-2,834)

      CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

      CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

      DISALLOWED changed from 140,423 to 140,428 (+5)

      ID_DIS or FREE_PVAL changed from 10,320 to 11,179 (+859)

      TOTAL did not change, at 1,114,112

   Code points that changed derived property value from other than
   UNASSIGNED: 0

   There are no changes made to Unicode between version 6.3.0 and 7.0.0
   that impact PRECIS calculation of the derived property values.

   Note: PRECIS Derived Property Value of the character ARABIC LETTER
   BEH WITH HAMZA ABOVE (U+08A1) added in Unicode 7.0.0, explained in
   Section 4.1 of draft-faltstrom-unicode12-00
   [I-D.faltstrom-unicode12], is PVALID in this review.  On the other
   hand, there is same normalization problem that this code point is not
   defined to be equivalent to code point sequence ARABIC LETTER BEH
   (U+0628) and ARABIC HAMZA ABOVE (U+0654) with the same form in the
   same script.

3.2.  Changes between Unicode 7.0.0 and 8.0.0

   Change in number of chacters in each category:

      PVALID changed from 100,969 to 107,978 (+7,009)

   Change in number of chacters in each category:

      PVALID changed from 107,978 to 115,317 (+7,339)

      UNASSIGNED changed from 846,293 to 837,775 (-8,518)

   that impact PRECIS calculation of the derived property values.

3.5.  Changes between Unicode 10.0.0 and 11.0.0

   Change in number of chacters in each category:

      PVALID changed from 123,734 to 124,136 (+402)

      CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

      CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

      DISALLOWED changed from 140,429 to 140,430 (+1)

      ID_DIS or FREE_PVAL changed from 12,147 to 12,428 (+281)

      TOTAL did not change, at 1,114,112

   Code points that changed derived property value from other than
   UNASSIGNED: 1

   As explained in Section 4.3 of draft-faltstrom-unicode12-00
   [I-D.faltstrom-unicode12], there are some Unicode General Properties
   changed.  Changes of properties for Georgian letters in the ranges
   U+10D0..U+10FA and U+10FD..U+10FF, ZANABAZAR SQUARE VOWEL SIGN AI
   (U+11A07) and SPHERICAL ANGLE OPENING UP (U+29A1) do not affect
   PRECIS calculation of the derived property values.

   Change of SHARADA SANDHI MARK (U+111C9) added in Unicode 8.0.0
   affects PRECIS calculation of the derived property values in

   IdentifierClass.  PRECIS Derived Property Value of this between
   Unicode 8.0.0 and Unicode 10.0.0 is ID_DIS or FREE_PVAL, however in
   Unicode 11.0.0 is PVALID.  This means that FreeformClass is not
   affected by this change.  However in IdentifierClass, this code point
   that is disallowed between Unicode 8.0.0 and Unicode 10.0.0 is
   allowed in Unicode 11.0.0.

3.6.  Changes between Unicode 11.0.0 and 12.0.0

   Change in number of chacters in each category:

      PVALID changed from 124,136 to 124,415 (+279)

      UNASSIGNED changed from 837,091 to 836,537 (-554)

      CONTEXTJ did not change, at 2

      CONTEXTO did not change, at 25

      DISALLOWED changed from 140,430 to 140,439 (+9)

      ID_DIS or FREE_PVAL changed from 12,428 to 12,694 (+266)

      TOTAL did not change, at 1,114,112

   Code points that changed derived property value from other than
   UNASSIGNED: 0

   There are no changes made to Unicode between version 11.0.0 and
   12.0.0 that impact PRECIS calculation of the derived property values.

   Note: Unicode General Propertie of CANADIAN SYLLABICS CHI SIGN
   (U+166D) was changed from Po to So in Unicode 12.0.0.  This change
   has changed the basis for calculating of the derived property value
   from Punctuation (P) in Section 9.16 of RFC 8264 to Symbols (O) in
   Section 9.15 of RFC 8264.  However, this change dose not affect the
   calculation result, because both derived property values are ID_DIS
   or FREE_PVAL.

4.  Conclusion

   As described in Section 3, there is one incompatible change made
   between Unicode 6.3.0 and 12.0.0.  U+111C9 has been changed derived
   property value from ID_DIS or FREE_PVAL to PVALID.  Other chnages of
   Unicode General Properties have not affected their derived property
   value.  As explained in Section 6 of draft-faltstrom-unicode12-00
   [I-D.faltstrom-unicode12], considering the impact on existing
   implementations, draft-faltstrom-unicode12-00

   [I-D.faltstrom-unicode12] concludes that U+111C9 is not added to the
   exception list deined BackwardCompatible (G) in Section 2.7 of RFC
   5892 [RFC5892].  And also PRECIS Framework defined to use the
   exception list in Section 2.6 of RFC 8264 [RFC8264], Therefore this
   document suggests that the derived proparty value is considerd PVALID
   according to draft-faltstrom-unicode12-00 [I-D.faltstrom-unicode12].

5.  IANA Considerations

   TBD.  IANA may be requested to update the PRECIS Derived Property
   Value registry.

6.  Security Considerations

   TBD.
