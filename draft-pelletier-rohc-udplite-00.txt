Abstract

   This document defines ROHC (Robust Header Compression) profiles for
   compression of IP/UDP Lite/RTP packets (Internet Protocol, User
   Datagram Protocol Lite, Real-Time Transport Protocol) and IP/UDP
   Lite. These profiles are defined based on their differences with the
   profiles specified in [RFC-3095] for the classic UDP [RFC-768].

   Although both transport protocols are very similar, ROHC profiles
   must be defined separately for robust compression of UDP Lite headers

   because it does not share protocol identifier with the classic UDP.
   Also, the UDP Lite Checksum Coverage field does not either share the
   semantics of the corresponding classic UDP Length field and as a
   consequence cannot always be inferred anymore. In addition, this
   coverage field may open new possibilities for additional compression
   efficiency when compared to the UDP profiles defined in [RFC-3095].

INTERNET-DRAFT         ROHC Profiles for UDP Lite      February 22, 2002


   1.  Introduction

   The ROHC WG has developed a header compression framework on top of
   which various profiles can be defined for different protocol sets, or
   for different compression strategies. Due to the demands of the
   cellular industry for an efficient way of transporting voice over IP
   over wireless, the main focus of ROHC [RFC-3095] has so far been on
   compression of IP/UDP/RTP headers, which are generous in size,
   especially compared to the payloads often carried by the packets with
   these headers.

   ROHC RTP has become a very efficient, robust and capable compression
   scheme, able to compress the headers down to a total size of one
   octet only. Also, transparency is guaranteed to an extremely high
   extent even when residual bit errors are present in compressed
   headers delivered to the decompressor.

   UDP Lite is a transport protocol similar to the classic UDP protocol
   [RFC-768]. UDP Lite is useful for applications that are designed with
   the capability to tolerate errors in the payload and for which
   receiving damaged data is better than dealing with the loss of entire
   packets. The protocol is particularly suitable for link technologies
   where data can be partially damaged, such as wireless links.

   New ROHC profiles are needed for UDP Lite because it does not share
   protocol identifier with the classic UDP. Also, the UDP Lite Checksum
   Coverage field does not either share the semantics of the
   corresponding Length field of the classic UDP and cannot always be
   inferred. In addition, the coverage field may open new possibilities
   for additional compression efficiency when compared to ROHC RTP.

   This document thus defines two ROHC profiles to allow compression of
   UDP Lite headers. The objectives of these profiles are to provide
   simple modifications to the existing profiles for compressing classic
   UDP headers, as well as introducing a simple method by which the UDP
   Lite checksum may be entirely compressed away in certain specific
   scenarios, without threats to the end-to-end nature of this checksum.
   This document therefore focuses on differences to the compression
   profiles for classic UDP headers, as specified in [RFC-3095], to
   define corresponding profiles for UDP Lite header compression.

   Revision history:
     00:  First version of this document, including:
          Motivation for the work, the problematic and some possible
          directions.

   This first draft is currently showing the initial state of the work,
   and will hopefully generate fruitful discussions around header
   compression for UDP Lite within the ROHC WG.

3.  Background

3.1.  The UDP Lite Protocol

   UDP Lite is a datagram transport protocol defined as an independant
   variant of the classic UDP transport protocol [RFC-768]. UDP Lite is
   very similar to the classic UDP, and allow applications that can
   tolerate errors in the payload to use a checksum with optionally
   partial coverage. See [UDPLite] for further information about the
   motivations and benefits of the protocol.

   UDP Lite replaces the classic UDP Length field of the header with a
   Checksum Coverage field indicating the number of octets covered by
   the 16-bit checksum, applied on a per-packet basis. The coverage area
   must minimally always include the entire UDP Lite header and may
   cover the entire datagram, in which case UDP Lite becomes
   semantically identical to the classic UDP. However, UDP Lite and
   classic UDP do not share protocol identifier.

   UDP Lite Header Format:
      0              15 16             31
     +--------+--------+--------+--------+
     |     Source      |   Destination   |
     |      Port       |      Port       |
     +--------+--------+--------+--------+
     |    Checksum     |                 |
     |    Coverage     |    Checksum     |
     +--------+--------+--------+--------+
     |                                   |
     |           data bytes ...          |
     +---------------- ...---------------+

   The UDP Lite checksum, like the classic UDP checksum, is an end-to-
   end mechanism against erroneous delivery of error sensitive data.

   In the case where the checksum is enabled for classic UDP (mandatory
   for IPv6 [RFC-2460]), such an unpredictable field cannot be
   compressed and is sent unmodified. The classic UDP Length field,
   however, is redundant and can be provided by the IP module. Header
   compression schemes do not normally transmit any bits of information
   for this field, as its value can be inferred.

   For UDP Lite, the Length field being redefined as the Checksum
   Coverage field leads to different properties for both the Checksum
   Coverage and the Checksum fields from a header compression
   perspective. The following table summarizes a possible classification
   for the UDP Lite header fields, using the same classes as in [RFC-
   3095].

   UDP Lite header fields and Classic UDP fields:
                                  +-------------------+-------------+
                                  |      UDP Lite     | Classic UDP |
     +-------------------+--------+-------------------+-------------+
     |       Header      |  Size  |       Class       |    Class    |
     |       Field       | (bits) |                   |             |
     +-------------------+--------+-------------------+-------------+
     |    Source Port    |   16   |     STATIC-DEF    | STATIC-DEF  |
     | Destination Port  |   16   |     STATIC-DEF    | STATIC-DEF  |
     | Checksum Coverage |   16   | CHANGING/INFERRED |             |
     |      Length       |   16   |                   |  INFERRED   |
     |     Checksum      |   16   | CHANGING/INFERRED |  CHANGING   |
     +-------------------+--------+-------------------+-------------+

   One difference from the classic UDP header fields behavior is that
   only in some cases may the Checksum Coverage be inferred, more
   specifically when either only the header(s) (UDP Lite header only or
   UDP Lite/RTP headers) or the entire datagram is covered.

   Another difference lies in the nature of the UDP Lite checksum field
   itself: the checksum value depends on the Checksum Coverage field and



Pelletier                                                       [Page 5]

   may exclude payload. An interesting consideration from a header
   compression perspective is that it may be acceptable under certain
   circumstances to replace the UDP Lite checksum and its functionality
   by a stronger cyclic redundancy check (CRC) using less bits, similar
   to the CRC currently used in ROHC profiles. Using the ROHC CRC could
   in some specific and potentially frequently occurring cases allow the
   UDP Lite checksum to be replaced and inferred at the receiver. In
   this respect, the presence of a stronger CRC using less bits would
   thus make the Checksum field redundant and make it acceptable not to
   transmit its uncompressed value.

3.2.  Checksum Coverage

   It is of interest to consider the semantics of the UDP Lite checksum
   when considering header compression, to find out if those semantics
   allow for some additional compression efficiency gains. Referring to
   [RFC-1144] section 3.1, when addressing the IP checksum:

          It seems rather silly to protect the transmission of
          information that is not being transmitted.

   The semantics of the UDP Lite Checksum allow for partial coverage of
   the datagram. It must minimally cover the transport-layer header
   [UDPLite]. This is particularly useful with IPv6, where the
   transport-layer checksum is mandatory [RFC-2460]. In this specific
   case, no information other than the checksum coverage and the actual
   checksum needs to be transmitted in the header compressed stream. It
   thus seem justified to not transmit those four octets, as this
   checksum in this case protects bits that are not transmitted.

   Moving forward in this line of reasoning, the case where the checksum
   also covers the entire RTP header in addition to the UDP Lite header
   may offer a similar opportunity. When operating with a high
   compression ratio, very few information bits are being sent as part
   of the compressed stream. It this case, it may also be acceptable to
   not transmit the checksum value, provided equal or superior
   protection is provided within the header compression scheme to
   replace the checksum functionality, for example transmitting a strong
   enough CRC within the compressed header. At the receiver, the
   checksum may then be regenerated locally when decompressing the
   headers and then validated using the CRC.

   The following figure shows the relationship between the possible UDP
   Lite checksum coverage and the ROHC CRC coverage.

   UDP Lite Checksum and ROHC CRC coverage:
     +--------+--------------+---------+-------------+
     | IP hdr | UDP Lite hdr | RTP hdr | RTP Payload |
     +--------+--------------+---------+-------------+
     <----- ROHC CRC coverage -------->
     <- UDP Lite Checksum --><- Optional coverage -->

INTERNET-DRAFT         ROHC Profiles for UDP Lite      February 22, 2002


   The UDP Lite Checksum Coverage field has four possible different
   behaviors embodied via the following assignments for its value:

     a. set to the UDP datagram length (or is set to 0)
     b. set to the UDP Lite header size (set to 8)
     c. set to the UDP Lite/RTP header size
     d. set to an unpredictable value, fluctuating between the UDP Lite
        (or UDP Lite/RTP) header length and the entire datagram length.

   The semantics of the Checksum Coverage field thus yields a number of
   different transport scenarios each having different properties from a
   header compression perspective. These properties are further
   summarized in the following figures, for each identified scenarios.

   Note that c is a special case of d, for which optimal compression
   efficiency may also be desirable.

   Note also that it is possible that an application use any of the
   possible coverage values within a single packet stream, and this is
   unpredictable from a header compression perspective.

   Total size of the fields in each class, for each scenarios:

   Scenario #1 û Assignment a.:
     +------------+---------------+
     |   Class    | Size (octets) |
     +------------+---------------+

INTERNET-DRAFT         ROHC Profiles for UDP Lite      February 22, 2002


   For scenario #1, corresponding to the classic UDP semantics, the
   checksum coverage field is inferred as in classic UDP case. The
   checksum (if enabled for IPv4) has completely random values and this
   field must be included as-is in the compressed header.

   For scenario #2, the checksum coverage field may be inferred from the
   size of the UDP Lite (UDP Lite or UDP Lite/RTP streams) or the size
   of the UDP Lite/RTP header (UDP Lite/RTP streams only). The checksum
   field can then be recalculated at the receiver and the ROHC CRC
   applied on the entire decompressed to validate the checksum
   recalculation.

   For scenario #3, the checksum coverage field and the checksum field
   have completely random values and these fields must both be included
   as-is in the compressed header.

4.  Design Rationale for UDP Lite ROHC profiles

   A strong motivation for the design of the UDP Lite header compression
   profiles is to use the semantics and properties of the UDP Lite
   checksum coverage to improve efficiency when the transport-layer
   checksum is enabled.

4.1.  UDP Lite considerations

   The UDP Lite checksum, like the classic UDP checksum, is an end-to-
   end mechanism against erroneous delivery of error sensitive data.
   Care must be taken not to violate this end-to-end functionality.

   The checksum coverage of UDP Lite is applied on a per-packet basis.
   As per the protocol definition, there is no guarantee that one of the
   scenarios identified in section 3.2 will occur more often than
   another. This in turn makes it difficult to maintain state in a
   header compression for the coverage field.

   The UDP Lite Checksum Coverage field may vary unpredictably and thus
   cannot always be inferred, as opposed to the corresponding Length
   field of the classic UDP.

4.2.  ROHC considerations

   The ROHC CRC

     ROHC packets may carry a CRC calculated over the uncompressed
     header. This CRC is defined at the framework level and is used by
     the decompressor to verify that the decompressed header is correct.
     This verification serves three purposes:

      - Detection of longer losses than can be covered by the sequence
        number LSBs
      - Protection against failures caused by residual bit errors in the



Pelletier                                                       [Page 8]

INTERNET-DRAFT         ROHC Profiles for UDP Lite      February 22, 2002


        compressed header
      - Protection against faulty implementations or other error causes

   Replacing the transport-layer checksum

     Since this document suggests that the end-to-end UDPLite checksum
     may be completely compressed away and replaced by the ROHC CRC,
     care must be taken to ensure that the CRC used offers equal or
     stronger robustness than what is provided by the UDP Lite checksum.
     Specifically, the ROHC CRC cannot replace the UDP Lite checksum
     unless the UDP Lite Checksum Coverage field covers only the UDP
     Lite or the UDP Lite/RTP headers. Otherwise, it must be sent
     uncompressed. This is necessary to ensure that the end-to-end
     nature of the checksum is maintained.

     It is thus reasonable to assume that compression and decompression
     transparency can be guaranteed even without explicitly carrying the
     uncompressed UPD Lite coverage field and/or uncompressed UDP Lite
     Checksum field in header compressed packets, in certain specific
     cases.

   Reuse of ROHC RTP and ROHC UDP mechanisms

     A ROHC compressor will initially behave as for ROHC RTP, however
     based on the UDP Lite profile identifier.

     The initialization of other headers than the UDP Lite header (IPv4,
     IPv6, RTP) is the same as [RFC-3095].

     The same actions are taken upon CRC failure as in ROHC 5.3.2.2.3.

   Additional notes

     A mechanism, for example via the definition of new packet types,
     must be defined to allow the compressor to segregate the different
     scenarios from each other (section 3.2), to allow the proper
     parsing and decompression of both the coverage and checksum fields,
     if these scenarios are to be used as a basis to improve compression
     efficiency. This mechanism may be defined in combination with a
     context value indicating if the checksum is enabled or not, similar
     to [RFC-3095].

     Additionally, for scenario #2 (section 3.2) it may be possible to
     achieve a minimal compressed header of one octet, similar to PT-0
     defined for ROHC RTP, even for IPv6 when the transport protocol
     checksum is mandated.

4.3.  Header compression strategies for UDP Lite

   This table revisits the corresponding table for the classic UDP from
   [RFC-3095] section A.3 and classifies the changing fields, based on

   the previously identified scenarios and for the case when the UDP
   Lite checksum is enabled.

   +----------------------------+-------------+-----------+-----------+
       Datagram: Scenario #1; Header: Scenario #2; Partial: Scenario #3

4.4.  UPD Lite checksum and ROHC CRC

   It is possible to replace the transport-layer checksum and the ROHC
   checksum by a stronger CRC, without removing the protection required
   by the transport-layer.

   Note well that the idea is to maintain the transport-layer checksum
   protection and keep the strong CRC for header reconstruction
   verification. Specifically, it consists into having both the header
   compression CRC and the transport-layer checksum replaced with a
   single checksum with the following properties:

   - offers equal or stronger protection than transport-layer checksum
   - protects all bits covered by the transport-layer checksum
   - offers equal or stronger robustness than the header compression CRC
   - protects the original transport-layer checksum

   A header compression CRC having these properties would allow the
   transport-layer checksum to be recalculated at the decompressor side
   before the entire decompressed header, including the recalculated
   checksum, is verified and validated using the CRC.


5.    ROHC UDP Lite profiles

   The profiles defined in this document borrows as much as possible the
   mechanisms defined in [RFC-3095]. This section summarizes the

INTERNET-DRAFT         ROHC Profiles for UDP Lite      February 22, 2002


   This chapter is incomplete and is an initial proposal for directions.

5.1.  Initialization of the UDP Lite header [UDPLITE]

   The IR and IR-DYN packets structure and initialization procedures are
   the same as for ROHC UDP, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

   For ROHC UDPLite, the dynamic part of a UDP packet is different than
   from [RFC-3095] (sections 5.11.1 and 5.7.7.5): a two-octet field
   containing the UDP Lite Checksum Coverage field is added before the
   Checksum field. This affects the format of dynamic chains in IR and
   IR-DYN packets.

   Static part:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      /          Source Port          /   2 octets
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      /       Destination Port        /   2 octets
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   Dynamic part:

      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      /       Checksum Coverage       /   2 octets
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      /           Checksum            /   2 octets
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   CRC-DYNAMIC: Checksum Coverage field, Checksum (octets 5-8).

   CRC-STATIC: All other fields (octets 1-4).

5.2.  States and modes

   ROHC UDPLite uses the same states, state logic and transitions as
   ROHC UDP, except when explicitly stated otherwise.

   It has not yet been determined whether ROHC UDPLite can use the same
   modes as ROHC RTP, and if so - how. This will require more
   explanations.

5.3.  Packet type format

   The general format of a ROHC UDPLite packet is the same as for ROHC
   UDP (see [RFC-3095] section 5.11). Padding and CIDs are the same, as
   are the feedback packet type (see [RFC-3095] section 5.7.6.1) and the
   feedback. IR and IR-DYN packets differ as described in section 5.1.

   The general format of compressed packets is also the same, but there
   are differences in specific formats as detailed below. These

INTERNET-DRAFT         ROHC Profiles for UDP Lite      February 22, 2002


   differences are introduced by the UPD Lite semantics of the Checksum
   Coverage field and the Checksum.

   The same notation as in ROHC RTP is used in this section:
   <mode format is used in>-<packet type number>-<some property>

5.4.  IP/UPD Lite/RTP compression: ROHC RTP/UDPLite (Profile TBD)

   Unless stated otherwise, the mechanisms of ROHC RTP are used also for
   ROHC RTP/UDPLite.

5.4.1. Initialization

   The static context is initialized in the same way as for ROHC RTP
   ([RFC-3095], section 5.11.1).

5.4.2  Packet types

   The notation used in this section is the same as in [RFC-3095]
   section 5.7. The general packet format is the same as for a
   compressed ROHC RTP header, with an exception for the field
   pertaining to the UDP Lite checksum and the addition of a field for
   the Checksum Coverage.

   --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   :                               :
   +  UDP Lite Checksum Coverage   +  2 octets,
   :                               :  if context(UDP Lite Checksum) != 0
    --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
   :                               :
   +      UDP Lite Checksum        +  2 octets,
   :                               :  if context(UDP Lite Checksum) != 0
    --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---

   Note that the order of the fields following the optional extension is
   the same as the order between the fields in an uncompressed header.

   Note that the presence of the UDP Lite Checksum and Checksum Coverage
   fields is inferred in a similar manner than for [RFC-3095] for every
   packet formats, with the exception of PT-0 and PT-1 where it is
   instead dependent on the packet format.

5.4.2.1  Packet type 0: PT-0

   PT-0: TBA

   It has not yet been determined if a 3-bit CRC is suitable to achieve
   the desired properties mentioned in section 4.4, and as a consequence
   if the U/O-0 packet format of ROHC RTP could be used as PT-0 for this
   profile.

5.4.2.2  Packet type 1: TBD

   Packet type 1: TBA

   The following header bits should be useful when defining PT-1:

   - Packet type (2 bits)          : 1 0, for packet type 1
   - Checksum Coverage Flag (1 bit): 1, if field is present
   - Checksum Flag (1 bit)         : 1, if field is present
   - CRC (? bits)                  : ROHC ?-bit CRC
                                     ([ROHC], section 5.9.2)
   - Other bits, depending on the packet type properties, based on ROHC
     RTP PT-0 and PT-1.

   Note that the flags are used to identify how the values of the
   Checksum Coverage and Checksum fields are to be decompressed, based
   on the different scenarios described in section 3.2.

5.4.2.3  Packet types 2, IR, IR-DYN and extensions

   Packet type 2 and extensions are the same as [RFC-3095]. Packet types
   IR and IR-DYN are the same as in [RFC-3095], except for the changes
   of section 5.1.


5.5.  Non-RTP IP/UPD Lite compression: ROHC UDPLite (Profile TBD)

   Unless stated otherwise, the mechanisms of ROHC UDP are used also for
   ROHC UDPLite, with the same considerations regarding the UDP SN
   taking the role of the RTP Sequence Number ([RFC-3095] section 5.11).

5.5.1. Initialization

   The static context for ROHC UDPLite streams can be initialized in
   similar ways as for ROHC UDP, however using the modified IR packet
   from section 5.1 and with the profile value set to (TBD) or reusing
   an existing context of a stream compressed using ROHC RTP/UDPLite.

   Note: In the case where an existing context is reused, the stream may
   have originally been assumed a UDP Lite/RTP stream, based on the UDP
   Lite protocol identifier (as opposed to assuming profile 0x0001).

5.5.2. Packet types

   TBA

6.  Security considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC-3095] apply integrally to this
   document without modifications.
