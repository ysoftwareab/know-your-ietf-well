 1. Introduction 
  
    The IPFIX protocol defines how IP Flow information can be 
    exported from routers, measurement probes or other devices. IP 
    flow information provides important input data for a variety of 
    applications. The IPFIX protocol is a general data transport 
    protocol that is easily extensible to suit the needs of such 
    applications. In this document we describe how typical 
    applications can use the IPFIX protocol and show opportunities 
    and limitations of the protocol. Furthermore, we describe the 
    relationship of IPFIX to other frameworks and architectures. 
    Although examples in this document are shown for IPv4 only, the 
    applicability statements apply to IPv4 and IPv6. IPFIX provides 
    appropriate Information Elements for both IP versions. 
     
 2. Applications of IPFIX 
     
    IPFIX data enables several critical applications. The IPFIX 
    target applications and the requirements that originate from 
    those applications are described in [RFC3917]. Those 
    requirements were used as basis for the design of the IPFIX 
    protocol. This section describes how these target applications 
    can use the IPFIX protocol. Considerations for using IPFIX for 
    other applications than described in [RFC3917] can be found in 
    section 4.1. 
  
  2.1 Accounting 
  
    Usage-based accounting is one of the target applications for 
    IPFIX as defined in [RFC3917]. IPFIX records provide fine-
    grained measurement results for highly flexible and detailed 
    usage reporting. Such data is used to realize usage-based 
    accounting. Nevertheless, IPFIX does not provide the reliability 
    required by usage-based billing-systems as defined in [RFC2975] 
    (see section 4.2). The accounting scenarios described in this 
    document only provide limited reliability as explained in 
    section 4.2 and should not be used in environments where 
    reliability as demanded by [RFC2975] is mandatory.  
  
    In order to realize usage-based accounting with IPFIX the flow 
    definition has to be chosen in accordance to the accounting 
    purpose.  
    Flows can be distinguished by various IEs (e.g. packet header 
    fields) from [IPFIX-INFO]. Due to the flexible IPFIX flow 
    definition, arbitrary flow-based accounting models can be 
    realized without extensions to the IPFIX protocol. 
     




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 4] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    Accounting can, for instance, be based on individual end-to-end 
    flows. In this case it can be realized with a flow definition 
    determined by the quintuple consisting of source address 
    (sourceIPv4Address), destination address 
    (destinationIPv4Address), protocol (protocolIdentifier) and port 
    numbers (e.g., udpSourcePort, udpDestinationPort). Another 
    example is class-dependent accounting (e.g. in a DiffServ 
    network). In this case flows could be distinguished just by the 
    DiffServ codepoint (DSCP) (ipDiffServCodePoint) and IP addresses 
    (sourceIPv4Address, destinationIPv4Address). The essential 
    elements needed for accounting are the number of transferred 
    packets and bytes per flow, which can be represented by the per-
    flow counter IEs (e.g., packetTotalCount, octetTotalCount). 
  
    For accounting purposes, it would be advantageous to have the 
    ability to use IPFIX flow records as accounting input in an AAA 
    infrastructure. AAA servers then could provide the mapping 
    between user and flow information. Again for such scenarios the 
    limited reliability currently provided by IPFIX has to be taken 
    into account. 
  
 2.1.1 Example 
  
    Please note: As noted in [RFC3330] the address block 
    192.0.2.0/24 may be used for example addresses. In the example 
    below we use two example networks. In order to be conformant to 
    [RFC3330] we divide the given address block into two networks by 
    subnetting with a 25 bit netmask (192.0.2.0/25) as follows: 
     
    Network A: 192.0.2.0 ... 192.0.2.127 
    Network B: 192.0.2.128 ... 192.0.2.255 
  
    Let's suppose someone has a Service Level Agreement (SLA) in a 
    DiffServ network requiring accounting based on traffic volume. 
    Flows are distinguished by source and destination address. The 
    information to export in this case is: 
        - IPv4 source IP address: sourceIPv4Address in [IPFIX-INFO], 
         with a length of 4 octets 
        - IPv4 destination IP address: destinationIPv4Address in 
         [IPFIX-INFO], with a length of 4 octets 
        - DSCP: ipDiffServCodePoint in [IPFIX-INFO], with a length of 
         1 octet 
        - Number of octets of the Flow: octetDeltaCount in [IPFIX-
         INFO], with a length of 4 octets  
         
    The template set will look as follows:

  2.2 Traffic Profiling  
     
    Measurement results reported in IPFIX records can provide useful 
    input for traffic profiling. IPFIX records captured over a long 
    period of time can be used to track and anticipate network 
    growth and usage. Such Information is valuable for trend 
    analysis and network planning. 
     
    The parameters of interest are determined by the profiling 
    objectives. Example parameters for traffic profiling are flow 
    duration, flow volume, burstiness, the distribution of used 
    services and protocols, the amount of packets of a specific 
    type, etc. [RFC3917].  
     
    The distribution of services and protocols in use can be 
    analyzed by configuring appropriate flows keys for flow 
    discrimination. Protocols can be distinguished by the 
    protocolIdentifier IE. Portnumbers (e.g., udpDestinationPort) 
    often provide information about services in use. Those flow keys 
    are defined in [IPFIX-INFO]. If portnumbers are not sufficient 
    for service discrimination, further parts of the packet may be 
    needed. Header fields can be expressed by IEs from [IPFIX-INFO]. 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 7] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    Packet payload can be reported by using the IE 
    ipPayloadPacketSection in [PSAMP-INFO]. 
  
    The flow duration can be calculated from the flow time stamp IEs 
    defined in [IPFIX-INFO] (e.g., flowEndMicroseconds - 
    flowStartMicroseconds). The number of packets and number of 
    bytes of a flow are represented in the per-flow counter IEs 
    (e.g., packetTotalCount, octetTotalCount). The burstiness of a 
    flow can be calculated from the flow volume measured at 
    different time intervals.  
  
  2.3 Traffic Engineering 
     
    Traffic engineering aims at the optimization of network resource 
    utilization and traffic performance [RFC2702]. Typical 
    parameters are link utilization, load between specific network, 
    nodes, number, size and entry/exit points of active flows and 
    routing information [RFC3917]. 
     
    The size of flows in packets and bytes can be reported by the 
    IEs packetTotalCount, octetTotalCount. Utilization of a physical 
    link can be reported by using a coarse grained flow definition 
    (e.g. based on identifier IEs such as egressInterface or 
    ingressInterface) and per-flow counter IEs (e.g. 
    packetTotalCount, octetTotalCount) defined in [IPFIX-INFO].  
     
    The load between specific network nodes can be reported in the 
    same way if one interface of a network node receives only 
    traffic from exactly one neighbor node (as is usually the case). 
    If the ingress interface is not sufficient for an unambiguous  
    identification of the neighbor node, sub-IP header fields IEs 
    (like sourceMacAddress) can be added as flow keys. 
  
    The IE observedFlowTotalCount provides the number of all flows 
    exported for the observation domain since the last 
    initialization of the metering process [IPFIX-INFO]. If this IE 
    is exported at subsequent points in time, one can derive the 
    number of active flows in a specific time interval from the 
    difference of the reported counters. The configured flow 
    termination criteria have to be taken into account to interpret 
    those numbers correctly. 
  
    Entry and exit points can be derived from flow records if 
    metering processes are installed at all edges of the network and 
    results are mapped in accordance to flow keys. For this and 
    other analysis methods that require the mapping of records from 
    different observation points, the same flow keys should be used 
    at all observation points. The path that packets take through a

    network can be investigated by using hash-based sampling 
    techniques as described in [DuGr00] and [PSAMP-TECH]. For this 
    IEs from [PSAMP-INFO] are needed. 
  
    Neither [IPFIX-INFO] nor [PSAMP-INFO] defines IEs suitable for 
    exporting routing information. 
     
  2.4 Network Security 
     
    Attack and intrusion detection are among the IPFIX target 
    applications described in [RFC3917]. Due to the enormous amount 
    of different network attack types, only general requirements 
    could be addressed in [RFC3917]. 
     
    The number of metrics useful for attack detection is as diverse 
    as attack patterns themselves. Attackers adapt rapidly to 
    circumvent detection methods and try to hide attack patterns 
    using slow or stealth attacks. Furthermore, unusual traffic 
    patterns are not always caused by malicious activities. A sudden 
    traffic increase may be caused by legitimate users who seek 
    access to a recently published web content. Strange traffic 
    patterns may also be caused by mis-configuration.  
  
    IPFIX can export flow information for arbitrary flow definitions 
    as defined in [IPFIX-PROTO]. Packet information can be exported 
    with IPFIX by using the additional information elements 
    described in [PSAMP-INFO]. With this theoretically all 
    information about traffic in the network at IP layer and above 
    is accessible. This data can be used either directly to detect 
    anomalies or can provide the basis for further post processing 
    to generate more complex attack detection metrics.  
     
    Depending on the attack type different metrics are useful. A 
    sudden increase of traffic load can be a hint that an attack has 
    been launched. The overall traffic at an observation point can 
    be monitored using per-flow counter IEs like packetTotalCount, 
    octetTotalCount as described in 2.3. The number of active flows 
    can be monitored by regular reporting of the 
    observedFlowTotalCount defined in [IPFIX-INFO]. 
     
    A sudden increase of flows from different sources to one 
    destination may be caused by an attack on a specific host or 
    network node using spoofed addresses. The number of flows from 
    or to specific networks or hosts can be observed by using source 
    and destination addresses as flow keys and observing the number 
    of active flows as explained above. 
    Many flows to the same machine but on different ports or many 
    flows to the same port and different machines may be an

    indicator for vertical or horizontal port scanning activities. 
    The number of flows to different ports can be reported by using 
    the portnumber information elements (udpSourcePort, 
    udpDestinationPort, tcpSourcePort, tcpDestinationPort) defined 
    in [IPFIX-INFO] as flow keys. 
     
    An unusual ratio of TCP-SYN to TCP-FIN packets can refer to SYN-
    flooding. The number of SYN and FIN packets in a flow can be 
    reported with the IPFIX information elements tcpSynTotalCount 
    and tcpFinTotalCount defined in [IPFIX-INFO]. 
     
    Worms may leave signatures in traffic patterns. Detecting such 
    events requires more detailed measurements and post processing 
    than detecting simple changes in traffic volumes. 
  
    A difficult task is the separation of good from bad packets to 
    prepare and launch counteraction. This may require a deeper look 
    into packet content by using further header field IEs from 
    [IPFIX-INFO] and/or packet payload from IE 
    ipPayloadPacketSection in [PSAMP-INFO].  
     
    Furthermore the amount of resources needed for measurement and 
    reporting increases with the level of granularity required to 
    detect an attack. Multi-step analysis techniques may be useful, 
    e.g., to launch an in-depth analysis (e.g. based on packet 
    information) in case the flow information shows suspicious 
    patterns. In order to supervise traffic to a specific host or 
    network node it is useful to apply filtering methods as those 
    described in [PSAMP-TECH]. 
  
    Mapping the two directions of a communication is often useful 
    for checking correct protocol behavior (see section 4.6). A 
    correlation of IPFIX data from multiple observation points (see 
    section 2.5.1) allows assessing the propagation of an attack and 
    can help to locate its source.  
     
    The integration of previous measurement results helps to review 
    traffic changes over time for detection of traffic anomalies and 
    provides the basis for forensic analysis. A standardized storage 
    format for IPFIX data would support the offline analysis of data 
    from different operators. 
     
    Nevertheless, capturing full packet traces at all observation 
    points in the network is not viable due to resource limitations 
    and privacy concerns. Therefore metrics should be chosen wisely 
    to allow a solid detection with minimal resource consumption. 
    Resources can be saved for instance by using coarser grained 
    flow definitions, reporting pre-processed metrics (e.g. with 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 10] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    additional information elements) or deployment of sampling 
    methods. 
  
    In many cases only derived metrics provide sufficient evidence 
    about security incidents. For example comparing the number of 
    SYN and FIN packets for a specific time interval can reveal an 
    ongoing SYN attack, which is not obvious from unprocessed packet 
    and flow data. Further metrics like the cumulated sum of various 
    counters, distributions of packet attributes or spectrum 
    coefficients have been used to identify a variety of attacks. 
     
    In order to detect attacks early it is useful to process the 
    data as soon as possible in order to generate significant 
    metrics for the detection. Pre-processing of raw packet and flow 
    data already at the measurement device can speed up the 
    detection process and reduces the amount of data that need to be 
    exported. Furthermore it is possible to directly report derived 
    metrics by defining appropriate Information Elements. Immediate 
    data export in case of a potential incident is desired. IPFIX 
    supports such source-triggered exporting of information due to 
    the push model approach. Nevertheless, further exporting 
    criteria have to be implemented to export IPFIX records upon 
    incident detection events and not only upon flow end or fixed 
    time intervals. 
     
    Intrusion detection would profit from the combination of IPFIX 
    functions with AAA functions (see section 3.5). Such an 
    interoperation enables further means for attacker detection, 
    advanced defense strategies and secure inter-domain cooperation. 
  
  2.5 QoS Monitoring 
     
    QoS monitoring is one target application of the IPFIX protocol 
    [RFC3917]. QoS monitoring is the passive observation of the 
    transmission quality for single flows or traffic aggregates in 
    the network. One example of its use is the validation of QoS 
    guarantees in service level agreements (SLAs). Typical QoS 
    parameters are loss [RFC2680], one-way [RFC2679] and round-trip 
    delay [RFC2681] and delay variation [RFC3393]. Whenever 
    applicable the IPPM metric definitions [RFC4148] should be used 
    when reporting QoS metrics. 
    The calculation of those QoS metrics requires per-packet 
    processing. Reporting packet information with IPFIX is possible 
    by simply considering a single packet as flow. [IPFIX-PROTO] 
    also allows the reporting of multiple identical information 
    elements in one flow record. Using this feature for reporting 
    information about multiple packets in one record would require 
    additional agreement on semantics regarding the order of 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 11] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    information elements (e.g. which timestamp belongs to which 
    packet payload in a sequence of information elements). [PSAMP-
    INFO] defines useful additional information elements for 
    exporting per packet information with IPFIX.  
  
 2.5.1 Correlating Events from Multiple Observation Points 
     
    Some QoS metrics require the correlation of data from multiple 
    observation points. For this the clocks of the involved metering 
    processes must be synchronized. Furthermore, it is necessary to 
    recognize that the same packet was observed at different 
    observation points. 
     
    This can be done by capturing parts of the packet content 
    (packet header and/or parts of the payload) that do not change 
    on the way to the destination. Based on the packet content it 
    can be recognized when the same packet arrived at another 
    observation point. To reduce the amount of measurement data a 
    unique packet ID can be calculated from the packet content e.g. 
    by using a CRC or hash function instead of transferring and 
    comparing the unprocessed content. Considerations on collision 
    probability and efficiency of using such packet IDs are 
    described in [GrDM98, DuGr00, ZsZC01]. 
     
    IPFIX allows the reporting of several IP and transport header 
    fields (see section 5.3 and 5.4 in [IPFIX-INFO]). Using only 
    those fields for packet recognition or ID generation can be 
    sufficient in scenarios where those header fields vary a lot 
    among subsequent packets, where a certain amount of packet ID 
    collisions are tolerable or where packet IDs need to be unique 
    only for a small time interval. 
     
    For including packet payload information the information element 
    ipPayloadPacketSection defined in [PSAMP-INFO] can be used. The 
    information element ipHeaderPacketSection can also be used. But 
    header fields that can change on the way from source to 
    destination have to be excluded from the packet ID generation, 
    because they may differ at different observation points.  
     
    For reporting packet IDs generated by a CRC or hash function the 
    information element digestHashValue defined in [PSAMP-INFO] can 
    be used. 
     
 2.5.2 Examples 
  
    The following examples show which information elements need to 
    be reported by IPFIX to generate specific QoS metrics. As an 
    alternative the metrics can be generated directly at the 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 12]

    exporter and IPFIX can be used to export the metrics (see 
    section 2
            ..7) 
  
 2.5.2.1 RTT measurements with packet pair matching (single-point) 
     
    The passive measurement of round-trip-times (RTT) can be 
    performed by using packet pair matching techniques as described 
    in [Brow00]. For the measurements, request/response packet pairs 
    from protocols such as DNS, ICMP, SNMP or TCP (SYN/SYN_ACK, 
    DATA/ACK) are utilized to passively observe the RTT [Brow00]. 
    This technique requires the correlation of data from both 
    directions. 
     
    Required information elements per packet (DNS example):  
    - Packet arrival time: observationTimeMicroseconds [PSAMP-INFO]  
    - DNS header: ipPayloadPacketSection [PSAMP-INFO] 
     
    Required functions:  
    - Recognition of request/response packet pairs 
     
    Remarks: 
    - Requires information elements from [PSAMP-INFO] 
    - observationTimeMicroseconds can be substituted by 
       flowStartMicroseconds [IPFIX-INFO], because a single packet 
       can be represented as a flow. 
    - If time values with a finer granularity are needed 
       observationTimeNanoseconds can be used. 
  
 2.5.2.2 One-way Delay Measurements (multi-point) 
  
    Passive one-way-delay measurements require the collection of 
    data at two observation points. As mentioned above synchronized 
    clocks are needed to avoid time-differences at the involved 
    observation points.  
     
    The recognition of packets at the second observation point can 
    be based on parts of the packet content directly. A more 
    efficient way is to use a packet ID (generated from packet 
    content). 
     
    Required information elements per packet (with packet ID): 
    - Packet arrival time: observationTimeMicroseconds [PSAMP-INFO]  
    - Packet ID: digestHashValue [PSAMP-INFO] 
     
    Required functions:  
    - Packet ID generation 
    - Delay calculation (from arrival times at the two observation 
       points) 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 13] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



  
    Remarks: 
    - Requires information elements from [PSAMP-INFO] 
    - observationTimeMicroseconds can be substituted by 
       flowStartMicroseconds [IPFIX-INFO], because a single packet 
       can be represented as a flow. 
    - If time values with a finer granularity are needed 
       observationTimeNanoseconds can be used. 
    - The amount of content used for ID generation influences the 
       number of collisions (different packets that map to the same 
       ID) that can occur. Investigations on this and other 
       considerations on packet ID generation can be found in 
       [GrDM98], [DuGr00], and [ZsZC01]. 
  
  2.6 Inter-Domain Exchange of IPFIX data 
     
    IPFIX data can be used to share information with neighbor 
    providers. A few recommendations should be considered if IPFIX 
    records travel over the public Internet compared to its usage 
    within a single domain. First of all, security threat levels are 
    higher if data travels over the public Internet. Protection 
    against disclosure or manipulation of data is even more 
    important than for intra-domain usage. Therefore IPsec or 
    Transport Layer Security (TLS) should be used as described in 
    [IPFIX-PROTO]. 
     
    Furthermore data transfer should be congestion-aware in order to 
    allow untroubled co-existence with other data flows in public or 
    foreign networks. That means transport over SCTP or TCP is 
    required.  
     
    Some ISPs are still reluctant to share information due to 
    concerns that competing ISPs might exploit network information 
    from neighbor providers to strengthen their own position in the 
    market. Nevertheless, technical needs have already triggered the 
    exchange of data in the past (e.g. exchange of routing 
    information by BGP). The need to provide inter-domain guarantees 
    is one big incentive to increase inter-domain cooperation. The 
    necessity to defend networks against current and future threats 
    (denial of service attacks, worm distributions, etc.) will 
    hopefully increase the willingness to exchange measurement data 
    between providers. 
     
  2.7  Export of Derived Metrics 
  
    The IPFIX protocol is used to transport flow and packet 
    information to provide the input for the calculation of a 





 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 14] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    variety of metrics (e.g. for QoS validation or attack 
    detection).  
    IPFIX can also be used to transfer these metrics directly, e.g. 
    if the metric calculation is co-located with measurement and 
    exporting process. 
  
    It doesn't matter which measurement and post-processing 
    functions are applied to generate a specific metric. IPFIX can 
    be used to transport the results from passive and active 
    measurements and from post-processing operations. For the 
    reporting of derived metrics additional information elements 
    need to be defined. 
     
    For most QoS metrics like loss, delay, delay variation etc. 
    standard IPPM definitions exist. In case such metrics are 
    reported with IPIFX, the IPPM standard definition should be 
    used.  
  
  2.8 Summary 
     
    The following table shows an overview of the information 
    elements required for the target applications described in 
    [RFC3917] (M-mandatory, R-recommended, O-optional). 
  
    | Application |[IPFIX-INFO]| [PSAMP-INFO] | additional IEs  |

    | Monitoring  |            |(most metrics)|(derived metrics)| 
    +-------------+------------+--------------+-----------------+ 
  
    For accounting the IEs in [IPFIX-INFO] are sufficient. As 
    mentioned above, IPFIX does not conform to the reliability 
    requirements demanded by [RFC2975] for usage-based billing 
    systems (see section 4.2).  For traffic profiling additionally 
    IEs from [PSAMP-INFO] can be useful to gain more insight into 
    the traffic. For traffic engineering flow information from 
    [IPFIX-INFO] is sufficient but it would profit from routing 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 15] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    information, which could be exported by IPFIX. Attack detection 
    usually profits from further insight into the traffic. This can 
    be achieved with IEs from [PSAMP-INFO]. Furthermore the 
    reporting of derived metrics in additional IEs would be useful. 
    Most QoS metrics require the use of IEs from [PSAMP-INFO]. IEs 
    from [PSAMP-INFO] are also useful for the mapping of results 
    from different observation points as described in section 2.5.1. 
  
 3. Relation of IPFIX to Other Frameworks and Protocols  
     
  3.1 IPFIX and IPv6 
     
    IPFIX has been designed from the beginning for IPv4 and IPv6. 
    Therefore IPFIX can be used in IPv4 and IPv6 networks without 
    limitations. The usage of IPFIX in IPv6 networks has two 
    aspects:  
     
    - Generation and reporting of IPFIX records about IPv6 traffic 
    - Exporting IPFIX records over IPv6 
     
    The generation and reporting of IPFIX records about IPv6 traffic 
    is possible. Appropriate information elements for the reporting 
    of IPv6 traffic are defined in [IPFIX-INFO].  
    Exporting IPFIX records over IPv6 is not explicitly addressed in 
    [IPFIX-PROTO]. Since IPFIX runs over a transport protocol (SCTP, 
    SCTP-PR, UDP or TCP) and all potential IPFIX transport protocols 
    can run in IPv6 networks one just needs to provide the chosen 
    transport protocol in the IPv6 network to run IPFIX over IPv6.  
     
  3.2 IPFIX and PSAMP 
     
    PSAMP defines packet selection methods, their configuration at 
    routers and probes and the reporting of packet information.  
     
    PSAMP uses IPFIX as basis for exporting packet information 
    [PSAMP-PROTO]. [PSAMP-INFO] describes further information 
    elements for exporting packet information and reporting 
    configuration information. 
  
    The main difference between IPFIX and PSAMP is that IPFIX 
    addresses the export of flow records whereas PSAMP addresses the 
    export of packet records. Furthermore, PSAMP explicitly 
    addresses remote configuration. It defines a MIB for the 
    configuration of packet selection processes. Remote 
    configuration is not (yet) addressed in IPFIX, but one could 
    consider extending the PSAMP MIB to also allow configuration of 
    IPFIX processes.

  3.3 IPFIX and RMON 
     
    RMON [RFC3577] is a widely used monitoring system that gathers 
    traffic data from RMON Agents in network devices. One major 
    difference between RMON and IPFIX is that RMON uses SNMP for 
    data export whereas IPFIX defines an own push-oriented protocol. 
    RMON defines MIBs that contain the information to be exported. 
    In IPFIX the data to be exported is defined as information 
    elements. 
     
    The most relevant MIBs for a comparison with IPFIX are the 
    Application Performance Measurement MIB (APM-MIB) [RFC3729] and 
    the Transport Performance Metrics MIB (TPM-MIB) [RFC4150]. 
    The APM-MIB has a complex system for tracking user application 
    performance, with reporting about transactions and SLA threshold 
    notification-trigger configuration, and persistence across DHCP 
    lease expirations. It requires a full RMON2-MIB protocolDirTable 
    implementation. 
     
    The APM-MIB reports the performance of transactions. A 
    transaction is a service oriented term and describes the data 
    exchange from the transaction start (when a user requests a 
    service) until its completion. The performance parameters 
    include response times, throughput, streaming responsiveness and 
    availability of services.  
     
    The RMON transaction concept differs from the IPFIX flow 
    concept. A flow is a very generic term that allows one to group 
    IP packets in accordance with common properties.  In contrast to 
    this, the term transaction is service-oriented and contains all 
    data exchange required for service completion.  
     
    In order to report such data with IPFIX one would probably need 
    a specific combination of multiple flows and the ability to map 
    those to the transaction. Due to the service-orientated focus of 
    APM, also the required metrics differ. For instance, the RMON 
    APM requires a metric for the responsiveness of services. Such 
    metrics are not addressed in IPFIX. 
     
    Furthermore, the APM-MIB allows the configuration of the 
    transaction type to be monitored, i.e., it addresses the 
    configuration of the metering process, which is currently not 
    addressed in IPFIX.  
     
    The APM MIB could be considered as an extension of the IPFIX 
    metering process where the application performance of a 
    combination of multiple flows is measured. If appropriate IEs 
    would be defined in the IPFIX information model and the IPFIX 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 17] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    device would support the APM MIB data collection, the solutions 
    could be complementary. That means one could use IPFIX to export 
    APM MIB transaction information. 
     
    The TPM-MIB breaks out the APM-MIB transactions into sub-
    application level transactions. For instance a web request is 
    broken down into DNS, TCP and HTTP sub-transactions.  
    Such sub-transactions can be considered as bi-directional flows. 
    With an appropriate flow definitions and the ability to map both 
    directions of a flow (see section 4.6), one could measure and 
    report flow characteristics of such sub-application level 
    transaction with IPFIX. 
     
    The TPM-MIB requires APM-MIB and RMON2-MIB. 
  
  3.4 IPFIX and IPPM 
     
    The IPFIX protocol can be used to carry IPPM network performance 
    metrics or information that can be used to calculate those 
    metrics (see sections 2.5 and 2.7 for details and references).  
     
  3.5 IPFIX and AAA  
     
    AAA defines a protocol and architecture for authentication, 
    authorization and accounting for service usage [RFC2903]. The 
    DIAMETER protocol [RFC3588] is used for AAA communication, which 
    is needed for network access services (Mobile IP, NASREQ, and 
    ROAMOPS). The AAA architecture [RFC2903] provides a framework 
    for extending AAA support to other services. DIAMETER defines 
    the exchange of messages between AAA entities, e.g. between AAA 
    clients at access devices and AAA servers, and among AAA 
    servers. DIAMETER is used for the transfer of accounting 
    records. In order to form accounting records for usage-based 
    accounting measurement data from the network is required. IPFIX 
    defines a protocol to export such data from routers, measurement 
    probes and other devices. Therefore it looks promising to 
    connect those two architectures.  
     
    For all scenarios described here one has to keep in mind that 
    IPFIX does not conform to the reliability requirements for 
    usage-based billing described in [RFC2975] (see section 4.2). 
    Using IPFIX without reliability extensions together with AAA 
    would result in accounting scenarios that do not conform to 
    usage-based billing requirements described in [RFC2975]. 
  
    As shown in section 2.1 accounting applications can directly 
    incorporate an IPFIX collecting process to receive IPFIX records 
    with information about the transmitted volume. Nevertheless, if 


 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 18] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    an AAA infrastructure is in place, the cooperation between IPFIX 
    and AAA provides many valuable synergistic benefits. IPFIX 
    records can provide the input for AAA accounting functions and 
    provide the basis for the generation of DIAMETER accounting 
    records. However, as stated in section 4.2 the use of IPFIX as 
    described in [IPFIX-PROTO] is currently limited to situations 
    where the purpose of the accounting does not require 
    reliability. 
     
    Further potential features include the mapping of a user ID to 
    flow information (by using authentication information) or using 
    the secure authorized exchange of DIAMETER accounting records 
    with neighbor domains. The last feature is especially useful in 
    roaming scenarios where the user connects to a foreign network 
    and the home provider generates the invoice.   
     
    Coupling an IPFIX collecting process with AAA functions has also 
    high potential for intrusion and attack detection. AAA controls 
    network access and maintains data about users and nodes. AAA 
    functions can help to identify the source of malicious traffic. 
    Authorization functions are able to deny access to suspicious 
    users or nodes. Therefore coupling those functions with an IPFIX 
    collecting process can provide an efficient defense against 
    network attacks.  
    Sharing IPFIX records (either directly or encapsulated in 
    DIAMETER) with neighbor providers allows an efficient inter-
    domain attack detection. For this it would be useful to allow 
    remote configuration of measurement and record generation in 
    order to provide information in the required granularity and 
    accuracy. Since remote configuration is currently not addressed 
    in IPFIX, this would require additional work. The AAA 
    infrastructure itself may be used to configure measurement 
    functions in the network as proposed in [RFC3334]. 
     
    Furthermore the transport of IPFIX records with DIAMETER would 
    require the translation of IPFIX Information Elements into 
    DIAMETER attribute value pairs (AVPs) defined in [RFC3588]. 
    Since the DIAMETER AVPs do not comprise all IPFIX Information 
    Elements it is necessary to define new AVPs to transport them 
    over DIAMETER. 
     
    Two possibilities exist to connect IPFIX and AAA:  
     
    - Connecting via an AAA Client 
    - Connecting via an Application Specific Module (ASM)

    Both are explained in the following sections. The approaches 
    only require few additional functions. They do not require any 
    changes to IPFIX or DIAMETER. 
     
 3.5.1 Connecting via an AAA Client 
     
    One possibility of connecting IPFIX and AAA is to run an AAA 
    client on the IPFIX collector. This client can generate DIAMETER 
    accounting messages and send them to an AAA server. The mapping 
    of the flow information to a user ID can be done in the AAA 
    server by using data from the authentication process. DIAMETER 
    accounting messages can be sent to the accounting application or 
    to other AAA servers (e.g. in roaming scenarios).

 3.5.2 Connecting via an Application Specific Module (ASM) 
     
    Another possibility is to directly connect the IPFIX collector 
    with the AAA server via an application specific module (ASM). 
    Application specific modules have been proposed by the IRTF AAA 
    architecture research group (AAARCH) in [RFC2903]. They act as 
    an interface between AAA server and service equipment. In this 
    case the IPFIX collector is part of the ASM. The ASM acts as an 
    interface between the IPFIX protocol and the input interface of 
    the AAA server. The ASM translates the received IPFIX data into 
    an appropriate format for the AAA server. The AAA server then 
    can add information about the user ID and generate a DIAMETER

    accounting application or to other AAA servers.

  3.6 IPFIX and RTFM  
   
    The Real-time Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) working group 
    defined an architecture for flow measurement [RFC2722]. This 
    section compares the Real-time Traffic Flow Measurement (RTFM) 
    framework with the IPFIX framework.  
          
 3.6.1   Architecture 
  
    The RTFM architecture [RFC2722] is very similar to the IPFIX 
    architecture. It defines meter, meter reader and a manager as 
    building blocks of the measurement architecture. The manager 
    configures the meter and the meter reader collects data from the 
    meter.  
    In RTFM the building blocks communicate via SNMP.  
    The IPFIX architecture [IPFIX-ARCH] defines metering, exporting 
    and collecting processes. IPFIX speaks about processes instead 
    of devices to clarify that multiple of those processes may be 
    collocated on the same machine. 
    Both definitions do not contradict each other. One could see the 
    metering process as part of the meter and the collecting process 
    as part of the meter reader.   
     
    One difference is that IPFIX currently does not define a 
    managing process, because remote configuration was at least 
    initially out of scope for the working group. 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 21] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



     
 3.6.2    Flow Definition 
  
   
   
   
     
    RTFM and IPFIX both consider flows as a group of packets which 
    share a common set of properties. A flow is completely specified 
    by that set of values, together with a termination criterion 
    (like inactivity timeout). 
     
    A difference is that RTFM defines flows as bidirectional. An 
    RTFM meter matches packets from B to A and A to B as separate 
    parts of a single flow, and maintains two sets of packet and 
    byte counters, one for each direction.  
  
    IPFIX does not explicitly state whether flows are uni- or 
    bidirectional. Nevertheless information elements for describing 
    flow properties were defined only for one direction in [IPFIX-
    INFO]. Nevertheless, there are several solutions for reporting 
    bi-directional flow information (see section 4.6). 
  
 3.6.3   Configuration and Management  
     
    In RTFM, remote configuration is the only way to configure a 
    meter. This is done by using SNMP and a specific Meter MIB 
    [RFC2720]. The IPFIX group currently does not address IPFIX 
    remote configuration. 
     
    IPFIX metering processes export the layout of data within their 
    templates, from time to time. IPFIX collecting processes use 
    that template information to determine how they should interpret 
    the IPFIX flow data they receive. 
     
 3.6.4   Data Collection 
     
    One major difference between IPFIX and RTFM is the data 
    collection model. RTFM retrieves data in pull mode whereas IPFIX 
    uses a push mode model to send data to collecting processes.  
     
    An RTFM meter reader pulls data from a meter by using SNMP. SNMP 
    security on the meter determines whether a reader is allowed to 
    pull data from it. An IPFIX exporting process is configured to 
    export records to a specified list of IPFIX collecting 
    processes. The condition when to send IPFIX records (e.g. flow 
    termination) has to be configured in the exporting or metering 
    process.

 3.6.5   Data Model Details  
  
    RTFM defines all its attributes in the RTFM Meter MIB [RFC2720]. 
    IPFIX information elements are defined in [IPFIX-INFO]. 
     
    RTFM uses continuously-incrementing 64-bit counters for the 
    storage of the number of packets of a flow. The counters are 
    never reset and just wrap back to zero if the maximum value is 
    exceeded. Flows can be read at any time. The difference between 
    counter readings gives the counts for activity in the interval 
    between readings. 
     
    IPFIX allows absolute (totalCounter) and relative counters 
    (deltaCounter) [IPFIX-INFO]. The totalCounter is never reset and 
    just wraps to zero if values are too large, exactly as the 
    counters used in RTFM. The deltaCounter is reset to zero when 
    the associated flow record is exported. 
  
 3.6.6   Transport Protocol  
          
    RTFM has a standards-track Meter MIB [RFC2720], which is used 
    both to configure a meter and to store metering results.  The 
    MIB provides a way to read lists of attributes with a single 
    Object Identifier (called a 'package'), which reduces the SNMP 
    overhead for flow data collection. SNMP, of course, normally 
    uses UDP as its transport protocol. Since RTFM requires a 
    reliable flow data transport system, an RTFM meter reader must 
    time out and resend unanswered SNMP requests. Apart from being 
    clumsy, this can limit the maximum data transfer rate from meter 
    to meter reader. 
     
    IPFIX is designed to work over a variety of different transport 
    protocols.  SCTP [RFC2960] and SCTP-PR [RFC3758] are mandatory.  
    UDP and TCP are optional.  In addition, the IPFIX protocol 
    encodes data much more efficiently than SNMP does, hence IPFIX 
    has lower data transport overheads than RTFM. 
  
 3.6.7   Summary 
     
    IPFIX exports flow information in push model by using SCTP, TCP 
    or UDP. It currently does not address remote configuration. RTFM 
    data collection is using the pull model and runs over SNMP. RTFM 
    addresses remote configuration which also runs over SNMP. Both 
    frameworks allow a very flexible flow definition, although RTFM 
    is based on a bi-directional flow definition.

 4. Limitations 
     
    The goal of this section is to show the limitations of IPFIX and 
    to give advice where not to use IPFIX or in which cases 
    additional considerations are required.  
     
  4.1 Using IPFIX for other Applications than Listed in RFC3917 
     
    IPFIX provides a generic export mechanism. Due to its template 
    based structure, it is a quite flexible protocol. Network 
    operators and users may want to use it also for other 
    applications than those described in [RFC3917]. 
     
    Apart from sending raw flow information it can be used to send 
    per-packet data, aggregated or post-processed data. For this new 
    templates and information elements can be defined if needed. Due 
    to its push mode operation IPFIX is also suited to send network 
    initiated events like alarms and other notifications. It can be 
    used for exchanging information among network nodes to 
    autonomously improve network operation.   
  
    Nevertheless, the IPFIX design is based on the requirements that 
    originate only from the target applications stated in [RFC3917]. 
    Using IPFIX for other purposes requires a careful checking of 
    IPFIX capabilities against application requirements. Only with 
    this one can decide whether IPFIX is a suitable protocol to meet 
    the needs of a specific application. 
     
  4.2 Using IPFIX for Billing (Reliability Limitations) 
  
    The reliability requirements defined in [RFC3917] are not 
    sufficient to guarantee the level of reliability that is needed 
    for usage-based billing systems as described in [RFC2975]. In 
    particular IPFIX does not support the following features 
    required by [RFC2975]: 
     
    - Record loss: IPFIX allows the usage of different transport 
       protocols for the transfer of data records. Resilience against 
       the loss of IPFIX data records can be only provided if TCP or 
       SCTP is used for the transfer of data records. 
    - Network or device failures: IPFIX does allow the usage of 
       multiple collectors for one exporter, but it neither specifies 
       nor demands the use of multiple collectors for the 
       provisioning of fault tolerance.  
    - Detection and elimination of duplicate records: This is 
       currently not supported by IPFIX. 
    - Application layer acknowledgements: IPFIX does not support the 
       control of measurement and exporting processes by higher level 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 24] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



       applications. Application layer acknowledgements are necessary 
       e.g. to inform the exporter in case the application is not 
       able to process the data exported with IPFIX. Such 
       acknowledgements are not supported in IPFIX. 
  
    Further features like archival accounting and pre-authorization, 
    are out of scope of the IPFIX specification but need to be 
    realized in billing system architectures as described in 
    [RFC2975]. 
     
  4.3 Using a Different Transport Protocol than SCTP 
     
    SCTP is the preferred protocol for IPFIX, i.e. a conforming 
    implementation must work over SCTP. Although IPFIX can also work 
    over TCP or UDP, both protocols have drawbacks [IPFIX-PROTO]. 
    Users should make sure they have good reasons before using 
    protocols other than SCTP in a specific environment. 
     
  4.4 Push vs. Pull Mode 
     
    IPFIX works in push mode. That means IPFIX records are 
    automatically exported without the need to wait for a request.  
    The responsibility for initiating a data export lies with the 
    exporting process.  
     
    Criteria for exporting data need to be configured at the 
    exporting process. Therefore push mode has more benefits if the 
    trigger for data export is related to events at the exporting 
    process (e.g. flow termination, memory shortage due to large 
    amount of flows, etc.). If the protocol used pull mode, the 
    exporting process would need to wait for a request to send the 
    data. With push mode it can send data immediately e.g. before 
    memory shortage would require a discarding of data. 
     
    With push mode one can prevent the overloading of resources at 
    the exporting process by simply exporting the information as 
    soon as certain thresholds are about to be exceeded. Therefore 
    exporting criteria are often related to traffic characteristics 
    (e.g. flow timeout) or resource limitations (e.g. size of flow 
    cache). But traffic characteristics are usually quite dynamic 
    and often impossible to predict. If those are used to trigger 
    flow export, the exporting rate and the resource consumption for 
    flow export becomes variable and unpredictable.  
     
    Pull mode has advantages if the trigger for data export is 
    related to events at the collecting process (e.g. a specific 
    application requests immediate input).  
     




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 25] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    In a pull mode, a request could simply be forwarded to the 
    exporting process. In a push mode, the exporting configuration 
    must be changed to trigger the export of the requested data. 
    Furthermore, with pull mode one can prevent the overloading of 
    the collecting process by the arrival of more records than it 
    can process. 
     
    Whether this is a relevant drawback depends on the flexibility 
    of the IPFIX configuration and how IPFIX configuration rules are 
    implemented.   
  
  4.5 Template ID number 
     
    The IPFIX specification limits the different template ID numbers 
    that can be assigned to the newly generated template records in 
    an observation domain. In particular, template IDs up to 255 are 
    reserved for Template or option sets (or other sets to be 
    created) and template IDs from 256 to 65535 are assigned to data 
    sets. In the case of many exports requiring many different 
    templates, the set of Template IDs could be exhausted.   
  
  4.6 Exporting Bidirectional Flow Information 
     
    Although IPFIX does not explicitly state that flows are 
    unidirectional, information elements that describe flow 
    characteristics are defined only for one direction in [IPFIX-
    INFO]. [IPFIX-PROTO] allows the reporting of multiple identical 
    information elements in one flow record. With this information 
    elements for forward and reverse direction can be reported in 
    one flow record.  
     
    But this is not sufficient. Using this feature for reporting 
    bidirectional flow information would require an agreement on the 
    semantic of information elements (e.g. first counter is counter 
    for the forward direction, second counter for reverse 
    direction).  
     
    Another option is to use two adjacent flow records to report 
    both directions of a bidirectional flow separately. This 
    approach requires additional means for mapping those records and 
    is quite inefficient due to the redundant reporting of flow 
    keys. 
     
  
  4.7 Remote Configuration 
     
    Remote configuration was initially out of scope of the IPFIX 
    working group in order to concentrate on the protocol 




 Zseby, Boschi, Brownlee, Claise                           [Page 26] 
                      IPFIX Applicability              May 2007 



    specification. Therefore there is currently no standardized way 
    to configure IPFIX processes remotely. Nevertheless due to the 
    broad need for this feature, it is quite likely that solutions 
    for this will be standardized soon.  
  
 5. Security Considerations 
     
    This document describes the usage of IPFIX in various scenarios.  
    Security requirements for IPFIX target applications and security 
    considerations for IPFIX are addressed in [RFC3917] and [IPFIX-
    PROTO]. Those requirements have to be met for the usage of IPFIX 
    for all scenarios described in this document. To our current 
    knowledge, the usage scenarios proposed in section 2 do not 
    induce further security hazards. 
     
    The threat level to IPIFX itself may depend on the usage 
    scenario of IPFIX. The usage of IPFIX for accounting or attack 
    detection may increase the incentive to attack IPFIX itself.  
    Nevertheless, security considerations have to be taken into 
    account in all described scenarios. 
     
    As described in the security considerations in [IPFIX-PROTO] 
    security incidents can become a threat to IPFIX processes 
    themselves, even if IPIFX is not the target of the attack. If an 
    attack generates a large amount of flows (e.g. by sending 
    packets with spoofed addresses or simulating flow termination) 
    exporting and collecting process may get overloaded by the 
    immense amount of records that are exported. A flexible 
    deployment of packet or flow sampling methods can be useful to 
    prevent the exhaustion of resources.    
     
    Section 3 of this document describes how IPFIX can be used in 
    combination with other technologies. New security hazards can 
    arise when two individually secure technologies or architectures 
    are combined. For the combination of AAA with IPFIX an 
    application specific module (ASM) or an IPFIX collector can 
    function as transit point for the messages. One has to ensure 
    that at this point the applied security mechanisms (e.g. 
    encryption of messages) are maintained. 
     
 6. IANA Considerations 
     
    This document has no actions for IANA.
