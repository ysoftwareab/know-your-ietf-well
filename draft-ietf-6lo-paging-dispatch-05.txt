1.  Introduction

   The design of Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) is generally
   focused on saving energy, which often is a very constrained resource.
   Other constraints, such as memory capacity and duty cycle
   restrictions on LLN devices, usually derive from that primary
   concern.  Energy is often available only from primary batteries that
   are expected to last for years, or is scavenged from the environment
   in very limited amounts.  Any protocol that is intended for use in
   LLNs must be designed with a primary focus on saving energy, which is
   a strict requirement.

   Controlling the amount of data transmission is one possible means of
   saving energy.  In a number of LLN standards, the frame size is
   limited to much smaller values than the IPv6 maximum transmission
   unit (MTU) of 1280 bytes.  In particular, an LLN that relies on the
   classical Physical Layer (PHY) of IEEE 802.15.4 [IEEE802154] is
   limited to 127 bytes per frame.  The need to compress IPv6 packets
   over IEEE 802.15.4 led to the 6LoWPAN Header Compression [RFC6282]
   work (6LoWPAN-HC).

   As more and more protocols need to be compressed, the encoding
   capabilities of the original dispatch defined in the 6lo adaptation
   layer framework ([RFC4944],[RFC6282]) becomes saturated.  This
   specification introduces a new context switch mechanism for 6LoWPAN
   compression, expressed in terms of Pages and signaled by a new Paging
   Dispatch mechanism.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

   The Terminology used in this document is consistent with and
   incorporates that described in Terms Used in Routing for Low-Power
   and Lossy Networks [RFC7102] and Terminology for Constrained-Node
   Networks [RFC7228].

3.  Updating RFC 4944

   This draft adapts 6LoWPAN while maintaining backward compatibility
   with IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 [RFC4944] by introducing a concept of a
   "parsing context" in the 6LoWPAN parser, a context being identified
   by a Page Number.  This specification defines 16 Pages.

   Pages are delimited in a 6LoWPAN packet by a Paging Dispatch value
   that indicates the next current Page.  The Page Number is encoded in
   a Paging Dispatch with the Value Bit Pattern of 1111xxxx where xxxx
   is the Page Number, 0 to 15, as described in Figure 1:

                            0
                            0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
                           |1|1|1|1|Page Nb|
                           +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

           Figure 1: Paging Dispatch with Page Number Encoding.

   Values of the Dispatch byte defined in [RFC4944] are considered as
   belonging to the Page 0 parsing context, which is the default and
   does not need to be signaled explicitly at the beginning of a 6LoWPAN
   packet.  This ensures backward compatibility with existing
   implementations of 6LoWPAN.

   The Dispatch bits defined in Page 0 by [RFC4944] are free to be
   reused in Pages 1 to 15.  This specification allocates some values in
   Page 1 in Section 4 and leaves the rest open for future allocations.

   Values opened by this specification in Page 1 to 14 are to be
   assigned for new protocols whereas Page 15 is reserved for
   experimentations.

   Note: This specification does not use the Escape Dispatch, which
   extends Page 0 to more values, but rather allocates another Dispatch

Internet-Draft           6LoWPAN Paging Dispatch            October 2016


   Bit Pattern (1111xxxx) for a new Paging Dispatch, that is present in
   all Pages, including Page 0 and Pages defined in future
   specifications, to indicate the next parsing context represented by
   its Page Number.  The rationale for avoiding that approach is that
   there can be multiple occurrences of a new header indexed by this
   specification in a single frame and the overhead on an octet each
   time for the Escape Dispatch would be prohibitive.

   A Page (say Page N) is said to be active once the Page N Paging
   Dispatch is parsed, and remains active until another Paging Dispatch
   is parsed.

4.  Page 1 Paging Dispatch

   This specification defines some special properties for Page 1,
   detailed below:

      The Dispatch bits defined for LOWPAN_IPHC by the Compression
      Format for IPv6 Datagrams over IEEE 802.15.4-Based Networks
      [RFC6282] are defined with the same values in Page 1 so there is
      no need to switch context from Page 1 to Page 0 to decode a packet
      that is encoded per [RFC6282].

      Mesh Headers represent Layer-2 information and are processed
      before any Layer-3 information that is encoded in Page 1.  If a
      6LoWPAN packet requires a Mesh header, the Mesh Header MUST always
      be placed in the packet before the first Page 1 Paging Dispatch,
      if any.

      For the same reason, Fragment Headers as defined in [RFC4944] MUST
      always be placed in the packet before the first Page 1 Paging
      Dispatch, if any.

      The NALP Dispatch Bit Pattern as defined in [RFC4944] is only
      defined for the first octet in the packet.  Switching back to Page
      0 for NALP inside a 6LoWPAN packet does not make sense.

      As a result, there is no need for restoring the Page 0 parsing
      context after a context was switched to Page 1, so the value for
      the Page 0 Paging Dispatch of 11110000 may not actually occur in
      those packets that adhere to 6LoWPAN specifications available at
      the time of writing this specification.

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4944] and [RFC6282] apply.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  Consuming Dispatch Types

   This document allocates 16 values from the Dispatch type field
   registry that was created for [RFC4944].  The allocated values are
   from 11 110000 through 11 111111 and represent Page Numbers 0 through
   15 as discussed in this document.

6.2.  New Column in Dispatch Type Registry

   This document extends the Dispatch type field registry that was
   created for [RFC4944] and updated by the [RFC6282], by adding a new
   column called "Page".

   This document defines 16 Pages, "Page 0" to "Page 15".

   The content of the incumbent registry is assigned to "Page 0".

   This document also places in the registry associated to Page 1 the
   Dispatch type field values that are allocated for LOWPAN_IPHC by
   [RFC6282].  These values range from 01 100000 through 01 111111 and
   have the same definition in Page 1 as they do in Page 0; as a result,
   the registry entries for Page 0 and Page 1 are an exact overlap in
   this range.

   Values ranging from 00000000 to 11101111 in Page 15 (that is all of
   Page 15 but the space used for Page switch) is reserved for
   experimentations and shall not be assigned.

   The resulting registry may be represented as a table as follow
   (partial):

   Future assignments in these registries are to be coordinated via IANA
   under the policy of "Specification Required" [RFC5226].  It is
   expected that this policy will allow for other (non-IETF)
   organizations to more easily obtain assignments.
