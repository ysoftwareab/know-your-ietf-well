               Securing RPSL Objects with RPKI Signatures
                    draft-ietf-sidr-rpsl-sig-09.txt

Abstract

   This document describes a method to allow parties to electronically
   sign RPSL-like objects and validate such electronic signatures.  This
   allows relying parties to detect accidental or malicious
   modifications on such objects.  It also allows parties who run
   Internet Routing Registries or similar databases, but do not yet have
   RPSS-like authentication of the maintainers of certain objects, to
   verify that the additions or modifications of such database objects
   are done by the legitimate holder(s) of the Internet resources
   mentioned in those objects.

1.  Introduction

   Objects stored in resource databases, like the RIPE DB, are generally
   protected by an authentication mechanism: anyone creating or
   modifying an object in the database has to have proper authorization
   to do so, and therefore has to go through an authentication procedure
   (provide a password, certificate, e-mail signature, etc.)  However,
   for objects transferred between resource databases, the
   authentication is not guaranteed.  This means when downloading an
   object stored in this database, one can reasonably safely claim that
   the object is authentic, but for an imported object one cannot.
   Also, once such an object is downloaded from the database, it becomes
   a simple (but still structured) text file with no integrity
   protection.  More importantly, the authentication and integrity
   guarantees associated with these objects do not always ensure that
   the entity that generated them is authorized to make the assertions
   implied by the data contained in the objects.

   A potential use for resource certificates [RFC6487] is to use them to
   secure such (both imported and downloaded) database objects, by
   applying a form of digital signature over the object contents.  A

   maintainer of such signed database objects MUST possess a relevant
   resource certificate, which shows him/her as the legitimate holder of
   an Internet number resource.  This mechanism allows the users of such
   database objects to verify that the contents are in fact produced by
   the legitimate holder(s) of the Internet resources mentioned in those
   objects.  It also allows the signatures to cover whole RPSL objects,
   or just selected attributes of them.  In other words, a digital
   signature created using the private key associated with a resource
   certificate can offer object security in addition to the channel
   security already present in most of such databases.  Object security
   in turn allows such objects to be hosted in different databases and
   still be independently verifiable.

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

2.  Signature Syntax and Semantics

   When signing an RPSL object, the input for the signature process is
   transformed into a sequence of strings of (ASCII) data.  The approach
   is similar to the one used in DKIM (Domain Key Identified Mail)
   [RFC4871].  In the case of RPSL, the object-to-be-signed closely
   resembles an SMTP header, so it seems reasonable to adapt DKIM's
   relevant features.

2.1.  General Attributes, Meta Information

   The digital signature associated with an RPSL object is itself a new
   attribute named "signature".  It consists of mandatory and optional
   fields.  These fields are structured in a sequence of name and value
   pairs, separated by a semicolon ";" and a white space.  Collectively
   these fields make up the value for the new "signature" attribute.
   The "name" part of such a component is always a single ASCII
   character that serves as an identifier; the value is an ASCII string
   the contents of which depend on the field type.  Mandatory fields
   must appear exactly once, whereas optional fields MUST appear at most
   once.

   Mandatory fields of the "signature" attribute:

   o  Version of the signature (field "v").  This field MUST be set to
      "rpkiv1".  The signature format described in this document applies
      when the version field is set to "rpkiv1".  All the rest of the
      signature attributes are defined by the value of version field.

Internet-Draft                Securing RPSL                   March 2016


   o  Reference to the certificate corresponding to the private key used
      to sign this object (field "c").  The value of this field MUST be
      a URL of type "rsync" or "http(s)" that points to a specific
      resource certificate in an RPKI repository [RFC6481].  Any non
      URL-safe characters (including semicolon ";" and plus "+") must be
      URL encoded.

   o  Signature method (field "m"): what hash and signature algorithms
      were used to create the signature.  The allowed algorithms which
      can be used for the signature are specified in Section 5 of RFC
      4055 [RFC4055].  More specifically, this version of RPSL
      signatures supports the following hash algorithms:

      *  sha224WithRSAEncryption

      *  sha256WithRSAEncryption

      *  sha384WithRSAEncryption

      *  sha512WithRSAEncryption

      The algorithms are referenced witin the signature attribute by the
      ASCII names of the algorithms.

   o  Time of signing (field "t").  The format of the value of this
      field MUST be in the Internet Date/Time format [RFC3339].  All
      times MUST be converted to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC)

   o  The signed attributes (field "a").  This is a list of attribute
      names, separated by an ASCII "+" character (if more than one
      attribute is enumerated).  The list must include any attribute at
      most once.

   o  The signature itself (field "b").  This MUST be the last field in
      the list.  The signature is the output of the signature algorithm
      using the appropriate private key and the calculated hash value of
      the object as inputs.  The value of this field is the digital
      signature in base64 encoding [RFC4648].

   Optional fields of the "signature" attribute:


   o  Signature expiration time (field "x").  The format of the value of
      this field MUST be in the Internet Date/Time format [RFC3339].
      All times MUST be represented in UTC.

2.2.  Signed Attributes

   One can look at an RPSL object as an (ordered) set of attributes,
   each having a "key: value" syntax.  Understanding this structure can
   help in developing more flexible methods for applying digital
   signatures.

   Some of these attributes are automatically added by the database,
   some are database-dependent, yet others do not carry operationally
   important information.  This specification allows the maintainer of
   such an object to decide which attributes are important (signed) and
   which are not (not signed), from among all the attributes of the
   object; in other words, we define a way of including important
   attributes while excluding irrelevant ones.  Allowing the maintainer
   of an object to select the attributes that are covered by the digital
   signature achieves the goals established in Section 1.

   The type of the object determines the minimum set of attributes that
   MUST be signed.  The signer MAY choose to sign additional attributes,
   in order to provide integrity protection for those attributes too.

   When verifying the signature of an object, the verifier has to check
   whether the signature itself is valid, and whether all the specified
   attributes are referenced in the signature.  If not, the verifier
   MUST reject the signature and threat the object as a regular, non-
   signed RPSL object.

2.3.  Storage of the Signature Data

   The result of applying the signature mechanism once is exactly one
   new attribute for the object.  As an illustration, the structure of a
   signed RPSL object is as follows:


     attribute1:  value1
     attribute2:  value2
     attribute3:  value3
     ...
     signature:   v=rpkiv1; c=rsync://.....; m=sha256WithRSAEncryption;
                  t=2014-12-31T23:59:60Z;
                  a=attribute1+attribute2+attribute3+...;
                  b=<base64 data>

2.4.  Number Resource Coverage

   Even if the signature(s) over the object are valid according to the
   signature validation rules, they may not be relevant to the object;




Kisteleki & Haberman    Expires September 4, 2016               [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                Securing RPSL                   March 2016


   they also need to cover the relevant Internet number resources
   mentioned in the object.

   Therefore the Internet number resources present in [RFC3779]
   extensions of the certificate referred to in the "c" field of the
   signature MUST cover the resources in the primary key of the object
   (e.g., value of the "aut-num:" attribute of an aut-num object, value
   of the "inetnum:" attribute of an inetnum object, values of "route:"
   and "origin:" attributes of a route object, etc.).

2.5.  Validity Time of the Signature

   The validity time interval of a signature is the intersection of the
   validity time of the certificate used to verify the signature, the
   "not before" time specified by the "t" field of the signature, and
   the optional "not after" time specified by the "x" field of the
   signature.

   When checking multiple signatures, these checks are applied to each
   signature, individually.

3.  Signature Creation and Validation Steps

3.1.  Canonicalization

   The notion of canonicalization is essential to digital signature
   generation and validation whenever data representations may change
   between a signer and one or more signature verifiers.
   Canonicalization defines how one transforms a representation of data
   into a series of bits for signature generation and verification.  The
   task of canonicalization is to make irrelevant differences in
   representations of the same object, which would otherwise cause
   signature verification to fail.  Examples of this could be:

   o  data transformations applied by the databases that host these
      objects (such as notational changes for IPv4/IPv6 prefixes,
      automatic addition/modification of "changed" attributes, etc.)


   o  the difference of line terminators across different systems.

   This means that the destination database might change parts of the
   submitted data after it was signed, which would cause signature
   verification to fail.  This document specifies strict
   canonicalization rules to overcome this problem.

Internet-Draft                Securing RPSL                   March 2016


   The following steps MUST be applied in order to achieve canonicalized
   representation of an object, before the actual signature
   (verification) process can begin:


   1.  Comments (anything beginning with a "#") MUST be omitted.


   2.  Any trailing white space MUST be omitted.


   3.  A multi-line attribute MUST be converted into its single-line
       equivalent.  This is accomplished by:



       *  Converting all line endings to a single blank space.


       *  Concatenating all lines into a single line.


       *  Replacing the trailing blank space with a single new line
          ("\n").


   4.  Numerical fields MUST be converted to canonical representations.
       These include:



       *  Date and time fields MUST be converted to UTC and MUST be
          represented in the Internet Date/Time format [RFC3339].


       *  AS numbers MUST be converted to ASPLAIN syntax [RFC5396].


       *  IPv6 addresses MUST be canonicalized as defined in [RFC5952].


       *  IPv4 addresses MUST be represented as the ipv4-address type
          defined by RPSL [RFC2622]

       *  All IP prefixes (IPv4 and IPv6) MUST be represented in CIDR
          notation [RFC4632].

   5.  All ranges, lists, or sets of numerical fields are represented
       using the appropriate RPSL attribute and each numerical element
       contained within those attributes MUST conform to the
       canonicalization rules in this document.

   6.  The name of each attribute MUST be converted into lower case, and
       MUST be kept as part of the attribute line.


   7.  Tab characters ("\t") MUST be converted to spaces.


   8.  Multiple whitespaces MUST be collapsed into a single space (" ")
       character.


   9.  All line endings MUST be converted to a singe new line ("\n")
       character (thus avoiding CR vs. CRLF differences).

3.2.  Signature Creation

   Given an RPSL object, in order to create the digital signature, the
   following steps MUST be performed:


   1.  For each signature, a new public/private key pair and certificate
       SHOULD be used.  Therefore the signer SHOULD create a single-use
       key pair and end-entity resource certificate (see [RFC6487]).
       The private key is used for signing this object this time.


   2.  Create a list of attribute names referring to the attributes that
       will be signed (contents of the "a" field).  The minimum set of
       these attributes is determined by the object type; the signer MAY
       select additional attributes.


   3.  Arrange the selected attributes according to the selection
       sequence specified in the "a" field as above, omitting all
       attributes that will not be signed.


   4.  Construct the new "signature" attribute, with all its fields,
       leaving the value of the "b" field empty.


   5.  Apply canonicalization rules to the result (including the
       "signature" attribute).

Internet-Draft                Securing RPSL                   March 2016


   6.  Create the signature over the results of the canonicalization
       process (according to the signature and hash algorithms specified
       in the "m" field of the signature attribute).


   7.  Insert the base64 encoded value of the signature as the value of
       the "b" field.


   8.  Append the resulting "signature" attribute to the original
       object.

3.3.  Signature Validation

   In order to validate a signature over such an object, the following
   steps MUST be performed:


   1.  Verify the syntax of the "signature" attribute (i.e., whether it
       contains the mandatory and optional components and the syntax of
       these fields matches the specification as described in section
       2.1.)


   2.  Fetch the certificate referred to in the "c" field of the
       "signature" attribute, and check its validity using the steps
       described in [RFC6487].


   3.  Extract the list of attributes that were signed using the signer
       from the "a" field of the "signature" attribute.


   4.  Verify that the list of signed attributes includes the minimum
       set of attributes for that object type.


   5.  Arrange the selected attributes according to the selection
       sequence provided in the value of the "a" field, omitting all
       non-signed attributes.


   6.  Replace the value of the signature field "b" of the "signature"
       attribute with an empty string.


   7.  Apply the canonicalization procedure to the selected attributes
       (including the "signature" attribute).

Internet-Draft                Securing RPSL                   March 2016


   8.  Check the validity of the signature using the signature algorithm
       specified in the "m" field of the signature attribute, the public
       key contained in the certificate mentioned in the "c" field of
       the signature, the signature value specified in the "b" field of
       the signature attribute, and the output of the canonicalization
       process.

4.  Signed Object Types, Set of Signed Attributes

   This section describes a list of object types that MAY signed using
   this approach.  For each object type, the set of attributes that MUST
   be signed for these object types (the minimum set noted in
   Section Section 3.3 is enumerated.

   This list generally excludes attributes that are used to maintain
   referential integrity in the databases that carry these objects,
   since these usually make sense only within the context of such a
   database, whereas the scope of the signatures is only one specific
   object.  Since the attributes in the referred object (such as mnt-by,
   admin-c, tech-c, ...) can change without any modifications to the
   signed object, signing such attributes could lead to false sense of
   security in terms of the contents of the signed data; therefore
   including such attributes should only be done in order to provide
   full integrity protection of the object itself.

   The newly constructed "signature" attribute is always included in the
   list.

      as-block:

      *  as-block

      *  org

      *  signature

      aut-num:

      *  aut-num

      *  as-name

      *  member-of

      *  import

      *  mp-import

      *  export

      *  mp-export

      *  default

      *  mp-default

      *  signature

      inet[6]num:

      *  inet[6]num

      *  netname

      *  country

      *  org

      *  status

      *  signature

      route[6]:

      *  route[6]

      *  origin

      *  holes

      *  org

      *  member-of

      *  signature

   For each signature, the RFC3779 extension appearing in the
   certificate used to verify the signature MUST include a resource
   entry that is equivalent to, or covers ("less specific" than) the
   following resources mentioned in the object the signature is attached
   to:


   o  For the as-block object type: the resource in the "as-block"
      attribute.

Internet-Draft                Securing RPSL                   March 2016


   o  For the aut-num object type: the resource in the "aut-num"
      attribute.


   o  For the inet[6]num object type: the resource in the "inet[6]num"
      attribute.


   o  For the route[6] object type: the resource in the "route[6]" or
      "origin" (or both) attributes.

5.  Keys and Certificates used for Signature and Verification

   The certificate that is referred to in the signature (in the "c"
   field):

   o  MUST be an end-entity (ie. non-CA) certificate

   o  MUST conform to the X.509 PKIX Resource Certificate profile
      [RFC6487]

   o  MUST have an [RFC3779] extension that covers the Internet number
      resource included in a signed attribute.

   o  SHOULD NOT be used to verify more than one signed object (ie.
      should be a "single-use" EE certificate, as defined in [RFC6487]).

6.  Security Considerations

   RPSL objects stored in the IRR databases are public, and as such
   there is no need for confidentiality.  Each signed RPSL object can
   have its integrity and authenticity verified using the supplied
   digital signature and the referenced certificate.

   Since the RPSL signature approach leverages X.509 extensions, the
   security considerations in [RFC3779] apply here as well.

   The maintainer of an object has the ability to include attributes in
   the signature that are not included in the resource certificate used
   to create the signature.  Potentially, a maintainer may include
   attributes that reference resources the maintainer is not authorized
   to use.

7.  IANA Considerations

   [Note to IANA, to be removed prior to publication: there are no IANA
   considerations stated in this version of the document.]
