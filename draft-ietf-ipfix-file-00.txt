1.  Introduction

   This document proposes a file format based upon IPFIX.  It begins
   with an overview of the IPFIX File format, as a quick summary of how
   IPFIX Files work.  It then explores the motivation for proposing a
   standardized flow file format and using IPFIX as the basis for this
   new file format.  Section 5 defines a set of requirements for this
   file format, and describes either how the IPFIX Message format meets
   each requirement, or how a file format based upon it could meet the
   requirement; and Section 4 describes the applicability of this file
   format to various specific applications.  The document then closes by
   specifying the details of new file format.  Examples of IPFIX Files
   meeting this specification appear in Appendix A This format makes use
   of the IPFIX Options mechanism for additional file metadata, in order
   to avoid requiring any protocol or message format extensions, and to
   minimize the effort required to adapt IPFIX implementations to use
   the file format.


2.  Terminology

   Terms used in this document that are defined in the Terminology
   section of the IPFIX Protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] document are
   to be interpreted as defined there.

   IPFIX File:   An IPFIX File is a serialized stream of IPFIX Messages
      stored on a filesystem.  Any IPFIX Message stream that would be
      considered valid when transported one or more of the specified
      IPFIX transports (SCTP, TCP, or UDP) as defined in the IPFIX
      Protocol draft [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] is considered an IPFIX
      File for purposes of this draft; however, this draft further
      restricts that definition with recommendations on the construction
      of IPFIX Files that meet the requirements identified herein.

   IPFIX File Reader:   An IPFIX File Reader is a Process which reads
      IPFIX Files from a filesystem, and is analogous to an IPFIX
      Collecting Process.  An IPFIX File Reader MUST behave as an IPFIX
      Collecting Process as outlined in the IPFIX Protocol draft
      [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], except as modified by this document.

   IPFIX File Writer:   An IPFIX File Writer is a process which writes
      IPFIX Files to a filesystem, and is analogous to an IPFIX
      Exporting Process.  An IPFIX File Writer MUST behave as an IPFIX
      Exporting Process as outlined in the IPFIX Protocol draft
      [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], except as modified by this document.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


3.  Design Overview

   An IPFIX File, as defined by this document, is simply a stream
   containing one or more IPFIX Messages serialized to some filesystem.
   Though any set of valid IPFIX Messages can be serialized into an
   IPFIX File, the specification proposes guidelines designed to ease
   storage and retrieval of flow data using the format.

   IPFIX Files contain only IPFIX Messages; any file metadata such as
   checksums or export session details are stored using Options within
   the IPFIX Message.  This design has several advantages, including
   complete compatibility with the IPFIX Protocol on the wire and free
   manipulability of IPFIX Files through concatenation, appending, and
   splitting (on IPFIX Message boundaries).  A schematic of a typical
   file is shown below:

4.  Motivation

   There are a wide variety of applications for the file-based storage
   of IP flow data, across a continuum of time scales.  Tools used in
   the analysis of flow data and creation of analysis products often use
   files as a convenient unit of work, with an ephemeral lifetime.  A
   set of flows relevant to a security investigation may be stored in a
   file for the duration of that investigation, and further exchanged
   among incident handlers via email or within an external incident



Trammell, et al.          Expires July 5, 2008                  [Page 6]

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


   handling workflow application.  Sets of flow data relevant to
   Internet measurement research may be published as files, much as
   libpcap packet trace files are, to provide common data sets for the
   repeatability of research efforts; these files would have lifetimes
   measured in months or years.  Operational flow measurement systems
   also have a need for long-term, archival storage of flow data, either
   as a primary flow data repository, or as a backing tier for online
   storage in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

   The variety of applications of flow data, and the variety of
   presently deployed storage approaches, would seem to indicate the
   need for a standard approach to flow storage with applicability
   across the continuum of time scales over which flow data is stored.
   A storage format based around flat files would best address the
   variety of storage requirements.  While much work has been done on
   structured storage via RDBMS, relational database systems are not a
   good basis for format standardization owing to the fact that their
   internal data structures are generally private to a single
   implementation and subject to change for internal reasons.  Also,
   there are a wide variety of operations available on flat files, and
   external tools and standards can be leveraged to meet file-based flow
   storage requirements.  Further, flow data is often not very
   semantically complicated, and is managed in very high volume;
   therefore, an RDBMS-based flow storage system would not benefit much
   from the advantages of relational database technology.

   The simplest way to create a new file format is simply to serialize
   some internal data model to disk, with either textual or binary
   representation of data elements, and some framing strategy for
   delimiting fields and records.  "Ad-hoc" file formats such as this
   have several important disadvantages.  They impose the semantics of
   the data model from which they are derived on the file format, and as
   such, they are difficult to extend, describe, and standardize.

   Indeed, one de facto standard for the storage of flow data is one of
   these ad-hoc formats.  A common method of storing data collected via
   Cisco NetFlow V5 or V7 is to serialize a stream of raw NetFlow
   datagrams into files.  These NetFlow PDU files consist of a
   collection of header-prefixed blocks (corresponding to the datagrams
   as received on the wire) containing fixed-length binary flow records.
   NetFlow V5 and V7 data may be mixed within a given file, as the
   header on each datagram defines the NetFlow version of the records
   following; there is indeed very little difference between the two
   record formats.  While this NetFlow PDU file format has all the
   disadvantages of an ad-hoc format, and is not extensible to data
   models other than that defined by Cisco NetFlow, it is at least
   reasonably well-understood due to its ubiquity.

   Over the past decade XML markup has emerged as a new "universal"
   representation format for structured data.  It is intended to be
   human-readable; indeed, that is one reason for its rapid adoption.
   However XML has limited usefulness for representing network flow
   data.  Network flow data has a simple, repetitive, non-hierarchical
   structure that does not benefit much from XML.  An XML representation
   of flow data would be an essentially flat list of the attributes and
   their values for each flow record.

   The XML approach to data encoding is very heavyweight when compared
   to binary flow encoding.  XML's use of start- and end-tags, and
   plain-text encoding of the actual values, leads to significant
   inefficiency in encoding size.  Typical network flow datasets can
   contain millions or billions of flows per hour of traffic
   represented.  Any increase in storage size per record can have
   dramatic impact on flow data storage and transfer sizes.  While data
   compression algorithms can partially remove the redundancy introduced
   by XML encoding, they introduce additional overhead of their own.

   A further problem is that XML processing tools require a full XML
   parser.  XML parsers are fully general and therefore complex,
   resource-intensive and relatively slow, introducing significant
   processing time overhead for large network-flow datasets.  In
   contrast, parsers for typical binary flow data encodings are simply
   structured, since they only need to parse a very small header and
   then have complete knowledge of all following fields for the
   particular flow.  These can then be read in a very efficient linear
   fashion.

   This leads us to propose the IPFIX Message format as the basis for a
   new flow data file format.  The IPFIX working group, in defining the
   IPFIX protocol, has already defined an information model and data
   formatting rules for representation of flow data.  Especially at
   shorter time scales, when a file is a unit of data interchange, the
   filesystem may be viewed as simply another IPFIX Message transport
   between processes.  This format is especially well suited to
   representing flow data, as it was designed specifically for flow data
   export; it is easily extensible unlike ad-hoc serialization, and
   compact unlike XML.  In addition, IPFIX is an IETF standard for the
   export and collection of flow data; using a common format for storage
   and analysis at the collection side allows implementors to use
   substantially the same information model and data formatting
   implementation for transport as well as storage.


5.  Requirements

   In this section, we outline a proposed set of requirements



Trammell, et al.          Expires July 5, 2008                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


   [SAINT2007] for any persistent storage format for flow data.  First
   and foremost, a flow data file format should support storage across
   the continuum of time scales important to flow storage applications.
   Each of the requirements enumerated in the sections below is broadly
   applicable to flow storage applications, though each may be more
   important at certain time scales.  For each, we first identify the
   requirement, then explain how the IPFIX Message format addresses it,
   or briefly outline the changes that must be made in order for an
   IPFIX-based file format to meet the requirement.

5.1.  Record Format Flexibility

   Due to the wide variety of flow attributes collected by different
   network flow attribute measurement systems, the ideal flow storage
   format will not impose a single data model or a specific record type
   on the flows it stores.  The file format must be flexible and
   extensible; that is, it must support the definition of multiple
   record types within the file itself, and must be able to support new
   field types for data within the records in a graceful way.

   IPFIX provides extensibility through the use of Templates to describe
   each Data Record, through the use of an IANA Registry to define its
   Information Elements, and through the use of enterprise-specific
   Information Elements.

5.2.  Self Description

   Archived data may be read at a time in the future where any external
   reference to the meaning of the data may be lost.  The ideal flow
   storage format should be self-describing; that is, a process reading
   flow data from storage should be able to properly interpret the
   stored flows without reference to anything other than standard
   sources (e.g., the standards document describing the file format) and
   the stored flow data itself.

   The IPFIX Message format is partially self-describing; that is, IPFIX
   Templates containing only IANA-assigned Information Elements can be
   completely interpreted according to the IPFIX Information Model
   without additional external data.

   However, Templates containing private information elements lack
   detailed type and semantic information; a Collecting Process
   receiving data described by a template containing private Information
   Elements it does not understand can only treat the data contained
   within those Information Elements as octet arrays.  To be fully self-
   describing, enterprise-specific Information Elements must be
   additionally described via IPFIX Options according to the Information
   Element Type Options Template defined in "Exporting Type Information

   for IPFIX Information Elements" [I-D.boschi-ipfix-exporting-type].

5.3.  Data Compression

   Regardless of the representation format, flow data describing traffic
   on real networks tends to be highly compressible.  Compression tends
   to improve the scalability of flow collection systems, by reducing
   the disk storage and I/O bandwidth requirement for a given workload.
   The ideal flow storage format should support applications which wish
   to leverage this fact by supporting compression of stored data.

   The IPFIX Message format has no support for data compression, as the
   IPFIX protocol was designed for speed and simplicity of export.  Of
   course, any flat file is readily compressible using a wide variety of
   external data compression tools, formats, and algorithms; therefore,
   this requirement can be met externally.

   However, a couple of simple optimizations can be made by File Writers
   to increase the integrity and usability of compressed IPFIX data;
   these are outlined in Section 7.3.

5.4.  Indexing and Searching

   Binary, record stream oriented file formats natively support only one
   form of searching, sequential scan in file order.  By choosing the
   order of records in a file carefully (e.g., by flow start or flow end
   time), a file can be indexed by a single key.

   Beyond this, properly addressing indexing is an application-specific
   problem, as it inherently involves tradeoffs between storage
   complexity and retrieval speed, and requirements vary widely based on
   time scales and the types of queries used from site to site.
   However, a generic standard flow storage format may provide limited
   direct support for indexing and searching.

   The ideal flow storage format will support a limited table of
   contents facility noting that the records in a file contain data
   relating only to certain keys or values of keys, in order to keep
   multi-file search implementations from having to scan a file for data
   it does not contain.

   The IPFIX Message format has no direct support for indexing.
   However, its template mechanism and the technique described in
   "Reducing Redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP Reports"
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-reducing-redundancy] can be used to describe the
   contents of a file in a limited way.  Additionally, as flow data is
   often sorted and divided by time, the start and end time of the flows
   in a file may be declared using the File Time Window Options Template

   defined in Section 7.1.3.

5.5.  Data Integrity

   When storing flow data over long time scales, especially for archival
   purposes, it is important to ensure that hardware or software faults
   do not introduce errors into the data over time.  The ideal flow
   storage format will support the detection and correction of encoding-
   level errors in the data.

   Note that more advanced error correction is almost certainly best
   handled at a layer below that addressed by this document.  Error
   correction is a topic well addressed by the storage industry in
   general (e.g. by RAID and other technologies), and by specifying a
   flow storage format based upon files, we can leverage these features
   to meet this requirement.

   However, the ideal flow storage format will be resilient against
   errors, providing an internal facility for the detection of errors
   and the ability to isolate errors to as few data records as possible.

   Note that this requirement interacts with the choice of data
   compression or encryption algorithm.  The use of block compression
   algorithms can serve to isolate errors to a single compression block,
   unlike stream compressors, which may fail to resynchronize after a
   single bit error, invalidating the entire message stream.  Similarly,
   the use of a stream cipher can serve to isolate errors in the
   plaintext without amplifying them as, for example, a cipher in CBC
   mode can.  See the "Recommended Compression Error Resilience
   Strategy" and "Recommended Encryption Error Resilience Strategy"
   sections below for more on this interaction.

   The IPFIX Message format does not support data integrity assurance.
   It is assumed that advanced error correction will be provided
   externally.  For simple error detection support, checksums may be
   attached to messages via IPFIX Options according to the Message
   Checksum Options Template defined in Section 7.1.1.

5.6.  Creator Authentication and Confidentiality

   Storage of flow data across long time scales may also require
   assurance that no unauthorized entity can read or modify the stored
   data.  Asymmetric-key cryptography can be applied to this problem, by
   signing flow data with the private key of the creator, and encrypting
   it with the public keys of those authorized to read it.  The ideal
   flow storage format will support the encryption and signing of flow
   data.

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


   As with error correction, this problem has been addressed well at a
   layer below that addressed by this document.  Instead of specifying a
   particular choice of encryption technology, we can leverage the fact
   that existing cryptographic technologies work quite well on data
   stored in files to meet this requirement.

   Beyond support for the use of TLS for transport over TCP or DTLS for
   transport over SCTP or UDP, both of which provide transient
   authentication and confidentiality, the IPFIX protocol does not
   support this requirement directly.  It is assumed that this
   requirement will be met externally.

5.7.  Anonymization and Obfuscation

   To ensure the privacy of individuals and organizations at the
   endpoints of communications represented by flow records, it is often
   necessary to obfuscate or anonymize stored and exported flow data.
   The ideal flow storage format will provide for a notation that a
   given information element on a given record type represents
   anonymized, rather than real, data.

   The IPFIX Message format presently has no support for anonymization
   notation.  It should be noted that anonymization is one of the
   requirements given for IPFIX in RFC 3917 [RFC3917].  The decision to
   qualify this requirement with 'MAY' and not 'MUST' in the
   requirements document, and its subsequent lack of specification in
   the current version of the IPFIX protocol, is due to the fact that
   anonymization algorithms are still an open area of research, and that
   there currently exist no standardized methods for anonymization.

   Simple anonymization notation may be attached to templates via IPFIX
   Options according to the Template Anonymization Options Template
   defined in Section 7.1.2.

5.8.  Session Auditability and Replayability

   Certain use cases for archival flow storage require the storage of
   collection infrastructure details alongside the data itself.  These
   details include information about how and when data was received, and
   where it was received from, and are useful for auditing as well as
   for the replaying received data for testing purposes.

   The IPFIX Message format contains no direct support for auditability
   and replayability, though the IPFIX Information Model does define
   various Information Elements required to represent collection
   infrastructure details.  These details may be stored in IPFIX Files
   using the Export Session Details Options Template defined in
   Section 7.1.4 and the Message Details Options Template defined in



Trammell, et al.          Expires July 5, 2008                 [Page 12]

   Section 7.1.5.

5.9.  Performance Characteristics

   The ideal standard flow storage format will not have a significant
   negative impact on the performance of the application generating or
   processing flow data stored in the format.  This is a non-functional
   requirement, but it is important to note that a standard that implies
   a significant performance penalty is unlikely to be widely
   implemented and adopted.

   A static analysis of the IPFIX Message format would seem to suggest
   that implementations of it are not particularly prone to slowness;
   indeed, a template-based data representation is more easily subject
   to optimization for common cases than representations that embed
   structural information directly in the data stream (e.g.  XML).
   However, a full analysis of the impact of using IPFIX Messages as a
   basis for flow data storage on read/write performance will require
   more implementation experience and performance measurement.


6.  Applicability

   This section describes the specific applicability of IPFIX Files to
   various use cases.  IPFIX Files are particularly useful in a flow
   collection and processing infrastructure using IPFIX for flow export.
   We explore the applicability and provide guidelines for using IPFIX
   files for the testing of IPFIX Collecting Processes, and the storage
   of flow data collected by IPFIX Collecting Processes and NetFlow V9
   collectors.

6.1.  Testing IPFIX Collecting Processes

   IPFIX Files can be used to store IPFIX Messages for the testing of
   IPFIX Collecting Processes.  A variety of test cases may be stored in
   IPFIX Files.  First, IPFIX data sets collected in real network
   environments and stored in an IPFIX File can be used as input to
   check the behavior of new or extended implementations of IPFIX
   Collectors.  Furthermore, IPFIX Files could be used to validate the
   operation of a given IPFIX Collecting Process in a new environment,
   i.e., to test with recorded IPFIX data from the target network before
   installing the Collecting Process in the network.

   The IPFIX File format can also be used to store artificial, non-
   compliant reference messages for specific Collecting Process test
   cases.  Examples for such test cases are sets of IPFIX records with
   undefined Information Elements, Data Records described by missing
   Templates, or incorrectly framed messages or data sets.



Trammell, et al.          Expires July 5, 2008                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


   Representative error handling test cases are defined in "IPFIX
   Testing" [I-D.ietf-ipfix-testing].

   Furthermore, fast replay of IPFIX records stored in a file can be
   used for stress/load tests (e.g., high rate of incoming Data Records,
   large Templates with high Information Element counts), as described
   in "IPFIX Testing" [I-D.ietf-ipfix-testing].  The provisioning and
   use of a set of reference files for testing simplifies the
   performance of tests and increases the comparability of test results.

   Note that an extremely simple IPFIX Exporting Process may be crafted
   for testing purposes by simply reading an IPFIX File and transmitting
   it directly to a Collecting Process.  Similarly, an extremely simple
   Collecting Process may be crafted for testing purposes by simply
   accepting connections and/or IPFIX Messages from Exporting Processes
   and writing the session's message stream to an IPFIX File.

6.2.  Storage of IPFIX-collected Flow Data

   IPFIX Files can also, naturally, be used to store flow data collected
   by an IPFIX Collecting Process; indeed, this was one of the primary
   initial motivations behind the file format described within this
   document.  Using IPFIX Files as such allows IPFIX implementations to
   leverage substantially the same code for flow export and flow
   storage.  In addition, the storage of single Transport Sessions in
   IPFIX Files is particularly important for network measurement
   research, allowing repeatability of experiments by providing a format
   for the storage and exchange of IPFIX flow trace data much as the
   libpcap format is used for experiments on packet trace data.

   As noted in the section above, the simplest way for a Collecting
   Process to store the data collected in a single Transport Session is
   to simply write the incoming IPFIX Messages to a file as they are
   read.  However, while the resulting files are valid IPFIX Files, they
   are lacking information about the IPFIX Transport Session used to
   export them, such as the network addresses of the Exporting and
   Collecting Processes and the protocols used to transport them.  An
   IPFIX File Writer MAY store a single IPFIX Transport Session in an
   IPFIX File and record information about the Transport Session using
   the Export Session Details Options Template described above.

   Additional per-Message information MAY be recorded by the File Writer
   using the Message Details Options Template described above.  Per-
   message information includes the time at which each IPFIX Message was
   received at the Collecting Process, and can be used to resend IPFIX
   Messages while keeping the original measurement plane traffic
   profile.  This Options Template also allows the storage of the export
   session metainformation provided the Export Session Details Options

   Template, for storing information from multiple Transport Sessions in
   the same IPFIX File.

6.3.  Storage of NetFlow V9-collected Flow Data

   Although the IPFIX protocol is based on the Cisco Netflow Services,
   Version 9 (NetFlow V9) protocol [RFC3954], the two have diverged
   since work began on IPFIX.  However, since the NetFlow V9 information
   model is a compatible subset of the IPFIX information model, it is
   possible to use IPFIX files to store collected NetFlow V9 flow data.
   This approach may be particularly useful in multi-vendor, multi-
   protocol collection infrastructures using both NetFlow V9 and IPFIX
   to export flow data.

   The differences between the two protocols are outlined in Appendix B.
   A simple, lightweight, message-for-message translation method for
   transforming V9 Packets into IPFIX Messages for storage within IPFIX
   Files is described in Appendix C.


7.  Detailed Description

   An IPFIX File, as introduced in Section 3 and elaborated below, is at
   its core simply an IPFIX Message stream serialized to some
   filesystem.  Any valid serialized IPFIX Message stream MUST be
   accepted by a File Reader as a valid IPFIX file.  In this way, the
   filesystem is simply treated as another IPFIX Transport alongside
   SCTP, TCP, and UDP.  In contrast to normal IPFIX operation, the time
   between a File Writer writing an IPFIX Message stream to a File and a
   File Reader reading it can be extremely variable.  In other words,
   this notional file transport has unusually high latency, as the File
   Reader and File Writer do not necessarily run at the same time.

   An IPFIX File Reader MUST accept as valid any IPFIX Message stream
   that would be considered valid by one or more of the other defined
   IPFIX transport layers.  Practically, this means that the union of
   template management features supported by SCTP, TCP, and UDP MUST be
   supported in IPFIX Files.  The following requirements apply to IPFIX
   File Readers:

   o  File Readers MUST accept IPFIX Messages containing Template Sets,
      Options Template Sets, and Data Sets within the same message, as
      with IPFIX over TCP or UDP.

   o  File Readers MUST accept Template Sets that define templates
      already defined within the file, as may occur with template
      retransmission when using IPFIX over UDP as described in section
      10.3.6 of the IPFIX Protocol draft [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  In



Trammell, et al.          Expires July 5, 2008                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


      the event of a conflict between a resent definition and a previous
      definition, the File Reader MUST assume that the new template
      replaces the old, as consistent with UDP template expiration and
      ID reuse.

   o  File Readers MUST accept Template Withdrawals as described in
      section 8 of the IPFIX Protocol draft [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol],
      provided that the Template to be withdrawn is defined, as is the
      case with IPFIX over TCP and SCTP.

   However, for representation simplicity and read performance, File
   Writers may choose to use the following template and scope management
   strategy:

   o  File Writers SHOULD emit each Template Set or Options Template Set
      before any Data Set described by the Templates within that Set, to
      ensure the File Reader can decode every Data Set without waiting
      to process subsequent Templates or Options Templates.

   o  If possible, File Writers MAY emit all Template Sets and Options
      Template Sets to appear at the beginning of the file, before any
      Data Sets, to ensure all Templates are available and can be
      inspected before any data is read.

   o  File Writers SHOULD emit special Data Records described by Options
      Templates at the beginning of the file after Template Sets and
      Options Template Sets as above, but before any other Data Records,
      in the following order:

      *  Time Window records described by the File Time Window Options
         Template as defined in Section 7.1.3 below; followed by

      *  commonPropertiesId definitions as described in "Reducing
         Redundancy in IPFIX and PSAMP Reports"
         [I-D.ietf-ipfix-reducing-redundancy]; followed by

      *  Information Element Type Records as described in "Exporting
         Type Information for IPFIX Information Elements"
         [I-D.boschi-ipfix-exporting-type]; followed by

      *  Anonymization notation records described by the Template
         Anonymization Options Template as defined in Section 7.1.2
         below; followed by

      *  Export Session details records described by the Export Session
         Details Options Template as defined in Section 7.1.4 below.





Trammell, et al.          Expires July 5, 2008                 [Page 16]

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


   o  File Writers SHOULD emit Data Records described by Options
      Templates to appear in the file before any Data Records which
      depend on the scopes defined by those options.

   o  File Writers SHOULD use Template Withdrawals to withdraw Templates
      if template IDs need to be reused.  In this case, the new
      Templates reusing those IDs SHOULD appear directly in the file
      after the Template Withdrawals making the IDs available for reuse.
      Template Withdrawals SHOULD NOT be used unless necessary to reuse
      template IDs.

   Note that Message Checksum records described by the Message Checksum
   Options Template as defined in Section 7.1.1 below and Message Detail
   records described by the Message Details Options Template as defined
   in Section 7.1.5 below MAY appear anywhere in an IPFIX Message.

   Each IPFIX File is generally synonymous with a single Transport
   Session.  File Writers SHOULD store the Templates and Options
   required to decode the data within the File in the File itself, and
   File Readers SHOULD NOT use Templates or Options defined in one file
   to decode or interpret Data Sets in another.

   However, some applications, particularly those storing large
   collections of data over long periods of time, may benefit from the
   ability to treat a collection of IPFIX Files as a single Transport
   Session.  A File Reader MAY be configurable to treat a collection of
   Files (e.g., all the files in a directory) as a single Transport
   Session.  However, a File Reader MUST NOT treat a single IPFIX File
   as containing multiple Transport Sessions.

   File Writers SHOULD write IPFIX Messages within an IPFIX File in
   ascending Export Time order.  If a File Writer is writing data
   collected from an IPFIX Collecting Process, the Export Time SHOULD be
   the export time as reported by the remote IPFIX Exporting Process;
   otherwise, the Export Time SHOULD be the time at which the message
   was written to the file.

   File Writers MAY write records to an IPFIX File in any order.
   However, File Writers that write flow records to an IPFIX File in
   flowStartTime or flowEndTime order SHOULD be consistent in this
   ordering within each File.

   If an IPFIX File uses the technique described in "Reducing Redundancy
   in IPFIX and PSAMP Reports" [I-D.ietf-ipfix-reducing-redundancy] AND
   all of the non-Options Templates in the File contain the
   commonPropertiesId Information Element, a File Reader MAY assume the
   set of commonPropertiesId definitions provides a complete table of
   contents for the File for searching purposes.

7.1.  Recommended Options Templates for IPFIX Files

   The following Options Templates allow IPFIX Message streams to meet
   the requirements outlined above without extension to the message
   format or protocol.  They are defined in terms of existing
   Information Elements defined in the IPFIX Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info], the Information Elements defined in "Exporting
   Type Information for IPFIX Information Elements"
   [I-D.boschi-ipfix-exporting-type], as well as Information Elements
   defined in Section 7.2.  IPFIX File Readers and Writers SHOULD
   support these options templates as defined below.

   In addition, IPFIX File Readers and Writers SHOULD support the
   Options Templates defined in "Exporting Type Information for IPFIX
   Information Elements" [I-D.boschi-ipfix-exporting-type] in order to
   support self-description of enterprise-specific Information Elements.

7.1.1.  Message Checksum Options Template

   The Message Checksum Options Template specifies the structure of a
   Data Record for attaching an MD5 message checksum to an IPFIX
   Message.  An MD5 message checksum as described MAY be used if long-
   term data integrity is important to the application.  The described
   Data Record MUST appear only once per IPFIX Message.

   The template SHOULD contain the following Information Elements:

7.1.2.  Template Anonymization Options Template

   The Template Anonymization Options Template specifies the structure
   of a Data Record for attaching anonymization notation information to
   Information Elements in specified Template Records.  A Data Record
   described by this Template SHOULD appear for each Information Element
   within a Template known by the Exporting Process or File Writer to
   contain anonymized data.

   The template SHOULD contain the following Information Elements:

7.1.3.  File Time Window Options Template

   The File Time Window Options Template specifies the structure of a
   Data Record for attaching a time window to an IPFIX File; this Data
   Record is referred to as a time window record.  A time window record
   defines the earliest flow start time and the latest flow end time of
   the flow records within a File.  One and only one time window record
   MAY appear within an IPFIX File if the time window information is
   available; a File Writer MUST NOT write more than one time window
   record to an IPFIX File.  A File Writer that writes a time window
   record to a File MUST NOT write any Flow with a start time before the
   beginning of the window or an end time after the end of the window to
   that File.

   The template SHOULD contain the following Information Elements:

7.2.  Recommended Information Elements for IPFIX Files

   The following Information Elements are used by the options templates
   in Section 7.1 to allow IPFIX Message streams to meet the
   requirements outlined above without extension of the message format
   or protocol.  IPFIX File Readers and Writers SHOULD support these
   Information Elements as defined below.

   In addition, IPFIX File Readers and Writers SHOULD support the
   Information Elements defined in "Exporting Type Information for IPFIX
   Information Elements" [I-D.boschi-ipfix-exporting-type] in order to
   support self-description of enterprise-specific Information Elements
   and anonymization notation.

7.2.1.  collectionTimeMilliseconds

   Description:   The absolute timestamp at which the data within the
      scope containing this Information Element was received by a
      Collecting Process.  This Information Element SHOULD be bound to
      its containing IPFIX Message via an options record and the
      messageScope Information Element, as defined below.

   Abstract Data Type:   dateTimeMilliseconds

   ElementId:   TBD1

   Status:   Proposed

7.2.2.  informationElementAnonymized

   Description:   A description of the anonymization status of an IPFIX
      information element within a template.  If this field is FALSE,
      the corresponding Information Element is not anonymized; to the
      best ability of the Exporting Process to determine, it represents

7.3.  Recommended Compression Error Resilience Strategy

   Note that, since any file may be compressed and decompressed with a
   variety of widely available tools implementing a variety of
   compression standards (both specified and de facto), compression of
   IPFIX File data can be accomplished externally.  However, compression
   at the file level is not particularly resilient to errors; in the
   worst case, a single bit error in a stream-compressed file may result
   in the loss of the entire file.

   To limit the impact of errors on the recoverability of compressed
   data, we recommend the use of block compression where possible.
   Ideally, the block compression algorithm should support the
   identification and isolation of blocks containing errors; bzip2 is an
   example of such a block compressor.

   Since the block boundary of a block-compressed IPFIX File may fall in
   the middle of an IPFIX Message, resynchronization of an IPFIX Message
   stream by a File Reader after a compression error requires some care.
   The beginning of an IPFIX Message may be identified by its header
   signature (the Version field of the Message Header, 0x00 0x0A,
   followed by a 16-bit Message Length), but simply searching for the
   first occurance of the Version field is insufficient, since these two
   bytes may occur in valid IPFIX Template or Data Sets.

   Therefore, we propose the following algorithm for File Readers to
   resynchronize an IPFIX Message Stream after skipping a compressed
   block containing errors:

   1.  Search after the error for the first occurance of the byte string
       0x00, 0x0A (the IPFIX Message Header Version field.)

   2.  Treat this field as the beginning of a candidate IPFIX Message.
       Read the two bytes following the Version field as a Message
       Length, and seek to that offset from the beginning of the
       candidate IPFIX Message.

   3.  If the first two bytes after the candidate IPFIX Message are
       0x00, 0x0A (i.e., the IPFIX Message Header Version field of the
       next message in the stream), or if the end of the file is reached



Trammell, et al.          Expires July 5, 2008                 [Page 28]

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


       precisely at the end of the candidate IPFIX Message, presume that
       the candidate IPFIX Message is valid, and begin reading the IPFIX
       File from the start of the candidate IPFIX Message.

   4.  If not, or if the seek reaches end-of-file or another block
       containing errors before finding the end of the candidate
       message, go back to step 1, starting the search two bytes from
       the start of the candidate IPFIX Message.

   The algorithm above will improperly identify a non-message as a
   message approximately 1 in 2^32 times, assuming random IPFIX data.
   It may be expanded to consider multiple candidate IPFIX Messages in
   order to increase reliability.

   In applications (e.g. archival storage) in which error resilience is
   very important, File Writers SHOULD use block compression algorithms,
   and MAY attempt to align IPFIX Messages within compression blocks to
   ease resynchronization after errors, if such is supported by the
   chosen block compressor.  File Readers SHOULD use the
   resynchronization algorithm above to minimize data loss due to
   compression errors.

7.4.  Recommended Encryption Error Resilience Strategy

   File-level encryption has error resilience issues similar to file-
   level compression.  Single bit errors in the encrypted data stream
   can result in unreadability of the entire remaining file, dependent
   on the encryption method used.  The use of CBC (Cipher Block
   Chaining) mode, which suffers from this low error resilience, is
   relatively common.

   In applications (e.g. archival storage) in which error resilience is
   very important, File Writers SHOULD use a stream cipher, for example
   a block cipher in OFB (Output Feedback) mode (often referred to as
   stream mode) instead of modes like CBC when encrypting, since errors
   are not amplified by stream ciphers: A single-bit error in the
   ciphertext results in a single bit error in the plaintext.
   Alternatively File Writers SHOULD use any other cipher which can
   resynchronize after bit errors.  An example is a block cipher in CBC
   mode that is reinitialized after a specific amount of data has been
   encrypted.  The maximum data loss per bit-error is then up to the
   next reinitialization point.  In this case, File Writers SHOULD also
   use the Message Checksum Options Template to attach a checksum to
   each IPFIX Message in the IPFIX File, in order to support the
   recognition of errors in the decrypted data.

8.  Security Considerations

   The IPFIX-based file format itself does not directly introduce
   security issues.  Rather it is used to store information which may
   for privacy or business issues be considered sensitive.  The file
   format must therefore provide appropriate procedures to guarantee the
   integrity and confidentiality of the stored information.

   The underlying protocol used to exchange the information that will be
   stored using the format proposed in this document must as well apply
   appropriate procedures to guarantee the integrity and confidentiality
   of the exported information.  Such issues are addressed in separate
   documents, specifically in the IPFIX Protocol
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].


9.  IANA Considerations

   This document specifies the creation of several new IPFIX Information
   Elements in the IPFIX Information Element registry located at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/ipfix, as defined in Section 7.2
   above.  IANA has assigned the following Information Element numbers
   for their respective Information Elements as specified below:

   o  Information Element number TBD1 for the collectionTimeMilliseconds
      Information Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD2 for the
      informationElementAnonymized Information Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD3 for the maxExportSeconds
      Information Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD4 for the maxFlowEndSeconds
      Information Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD5 for the messageMD5Checksum
      Information Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD6 for the messageScope Information
      Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD7 for the minExportSeconds
      Information Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD8 for the minFlowStartSeconds
      Information Element.

   o  Information Element number TBD9 for the sessionScope Information
      Element.

   [NOTE for IANA: The text TBD1, TBD2, TBD3, TBD4, TBD5, TBD6, TBD7,
   TBD8, and TBD9 should be replaced with the respective assigned
   Information Element numbers where they appear in this document.]

Appendix A.  Example IPFIX File

   In this section we will explore an example IPFIX File which
   demonstrates the various features of the IPFIX File format.  This
   file contains anonymized flow records described by a single Template.
   This file also contains a File Time Window record to note the start
   and end time of the data, and an Export Session Details record to
   record collection infrastructure information.  Each Message within
   this File also contains a Message Checksum record, as this file may
   be externally encrypted and/or stored as an archive.  The structure
   of this file is shown in Figure 2.

A.2.  Example Supplemental Options Data

   Following the templates required to decode the file is the
   supplemental options information used to describe the file's contents
   and type information.  First comes the File Time Window record; it
   notes that the file contains data from 9 October 2007 between
   00:01:13 and 23:56:27 UTC, and appears within its Data Set as in
   Figure 6:

   Following the anonymization information is information about how the
   data in the file was collected, in the Export Session Details record.
   This record notes that the session stored in this file was sent via
   SCTP from an exporter at 192.0.2.30 port 32769 to an collector at
   192.0.2.40 port 4739, and contains messages exported between 00:01:57
   and 23:57:12 UTC on 9 October 2007; it is represented in its Data Set
   as in Figure 8:

Appendix B.  Comparing NetFlow V9 to IPFIX

   With a few caveats, the IPFIX Protocol is a superset of the NetFlow
   V9 protocol, having evolved from it largely through a process of
   feature addition to bring it into compliance with the IPFIX
   Requirements and the needs of stakeholders within the IPFIX Working
   Group.  This appendix outlines the differences between the two
   protocols.  It is informative only, and presented as an exploration
   of the two protocols to motivate the usage of IPFIX Files to store
   V9-collected flow data.

B.1.  Message Header Format

   Both NetFlow V9 and IPFIX use streams of messages prefixed by a
   message header, though the message header differs significantly
   between the two.  Note that in NetFlow V9 terminology, these messages
   are called packets, and messages must be delimited by datagram
   boundaries.  IPFIX does not have this constraint.  The header formats
   are detailed below:

    0                   1                   2                   3

                  Figure 13: IPFIX Message Header Format

   Version Number:   The IPFIX Version Number MUST be 10, while the
      NetFlow V9 Version Number MUST be 9.

   Length vs. Count:   The Count field in the NetFlow V9 packet header
      counts records in the message (including data and template
      records), while the Length field in the IPFIX Message Header
      counts octets in the message.  Note that this implies that NetFlow
      V9 collectors must rely on datagram boundaries or some other
      external delimeter; or otherwise must completely consume a message
      before finding its end.

   System Uptime:   System uptime in milliseconds is exported in the
      NetFlow V9 packet header.  This field is not present in the IPFIX
      Message Header, and must be exported using an IPFIX Option if
      required.

   Export Time:   Aside from being called UNIX Secs in the NetFlow V9
      packet header specification, the export time in seconds since 1
      January 1970 at 0000 UTC appears in both NetFlow V9 and IPFIX
      message headers.

   Sequence Number:   The NetFlow V9 Sequence Number counts packets,
      while the IPFIX Sequence Number counts records in Data Sets.  Both
      are scoped to Observation Domain.

   Observation Domain ID:   Similarly, the NetFlow V9 sourceID has
      become the IPFIX Observation Domain ID.

B.2.  Set Header Format

   Set headers are identical between NetFlow V9 and IPFIX; that is, each
   Set (FlowSet in NetFlow V9 terminology) is prefixed by a 4-byte set
   header containing the Set ID and the length of the set in octets.

Internet-Draft                 IPFIX Files                  January 2008


   Note that the special Set IDs are different between IPFIX and NetFlow
   V9.  IPFIX Template Sets are identified by Set ID 2, while NetFlow V9
   Template FlowSets are identified by Set ID 0.  Similarly, IPFIX
   Options Template Sets are identified by Set ID 3, while NetFlow V9
   Options Template FlowSets are identified by Set ID 1.

   Both protocols reserve Set IDs 0-255, and use Set IDs 256-65535 for
   Date Sets (or FlowSets, in NetFlow V9 terminology).

B.3.  Template Format

   Template FlowSets in NetFlow V9 support a subset of functionality of
   those in IPFIX.  Specifically, NetFlow V9 does not have any support
   for vendor-specific Information Elements as IPFIX does, so there is
   no enterprise bit or facility for associating a private enterprise
   number with an information element.

   Options Template FlowSets in NetFlow V9 are similar to Options
   Template Sets in IPFIX in the same way.

B.4.  Information Model

   The NetFlow V9 field type definitions are a compatible subset of, and
   have evolved in concert with, the IPFIX Information Model.  IPFIX
   Information Element numbers in the range 1-127 are defined by the
   IPFIX Information Model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] to be compatible with
   the corresponding NetFlow V9 field types.

B.5.  Template Management

   NetFlow V9 has no concept of a Transport Session as in IPFIX, as
   NetFlow V9 was designed with a connectionless transport in mind.
   Template IDs are therefore scoped to an Exporting Process lifetime
   (i.e., an Exporting Process instance between restarts).  There is no
   facility in NetFlow V9 as in IPFIX for Template withdrawal or
   Template ID reuse.  Template retransmission at the Exporter works as
   in UDP-based IPFIX Exporting Processes.

B.6.  Transport

   In practice, though NetFlow V9 is designed to be transport-
   independent, it is transported only over UDP.  There is no facility
   as in IPFIX for full connection-oriented transport without datagram
   boundaries, due to the use of a record count field as opposed to a
   message length field in the packet header.  There is no support in
   NetFlow V9 for transport layer security via TLS or DTLS.

Appendix C.  A Method for Transforming NetFlow V9 messages to IPFIX

   This appendix describes a method for transforming NetFlow V9 Packets
   into IPFIX Messages, which can be used to store NetFlow V9 data in
   IPFIX Files.  A process transforming NetFlow V9 Packets into IPFIX
   Messages must handle the fact that NetFlow V9 Packets and IPFIX
   Messages are framed differently, that sequence numbering works
   differently, and that the NetFlow V9 field type definitions are only
   compatible with the IPFIX Information Model field and/or information
   element numbers below Information Element number 128.

   For each incoming NetFlow V9 packet, the transformation process must:

   1.  Verify that the Version field of the packet header is 9.

   2.  Verify that the Sequence Number field of the packet header is
       valid.

   3.  Scan the packet to:

       1.  verify that it contains no Templates with field numbers
           outside the range 1-127;

       2.  verify that it contains no FlowSets with Set IDs between 2
           and 255 inclusive;

       3.  verify that it contains the number of records in FlowSets,
           Template FlowSets, and Options Template FlowSets declared in
           the Count field of the packet header; and

       4.  count the number of records in FlowSets for calculating the
           IPFIX Sequence number.

   4.  Calculate a Sequence Number for each IPFIX Observation Domain by
       storing the last Sequence Number sent for each Observation Domain
       plus the count of records in FlowSets in the previous step to be
       sent as the Sequence Number for the IPFIX Message within that
       Observation Domain following this one.

   5.  Generate a new IPFIX Message Header with:

       1.  a Version field of 10;

       2.  a Length field with the number of octets in the IPFIX
           Message, generally available by subtracting 4 from the length
           of the NetFlow V9 packet as returned from the transport layer
           (accounting for the difference in message header lengths);

       3.  the Sequence Number calculated for this message by the
           Sequence Number calculation step; and

       4.  Export Time and Observation Domain ID taken from the UNIX
           secs and Source ID fields of the NetFlow V9 packet header,
           respectively.

   6.  Copy each FlowSet from the Netflow V9 packet to the IPFIX Message
       after the header.  Replace Set ID 0 with Set ID 2 for Template
       Sets, and Set ID 1 with Set ID 3 for Options Template Sets.

   Note that this process loses system uptime information; if such
   information is required, the transformation process will have to
   export that information using IPFIX Options.  This may require a more
   sophisticated transformation process structure.

C.1.  NetFlow V9 Transformation Example

   The following two figures show a single NetFlow V9 packet with
   templates and the corresponding IPFIX Message, exporting a single
   flow record representing 60,303 octets sent from 192.0.2.2 to
   192.0.2.3.  This would be the 3rd packet exported in Observation
   Domain 33 from the NetFlow V9 exporter, containing records starting
   with the 12th record (packet and record sequence numbers count from
   0).

   The ** symbol in the IPFIX example shows those fields that required
   modification from the NetFlow V9 packet by the transformation
   process.
