Abstract

   One of the most strategic problems still open in PKIX is locating
   public data and services associated with a Certification Authority
   (CA).  This issue impacts interoperability and usability in PKIX.

   This draft describes the PKI Resource Query Protocol (PRQP), its
   design, definition, and its impact in already deployed PKIX
   protocols.

1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   An increasing number of services and protocols are being defined to
   address different needs of users and administrators of PKIs.  With
   the deployment of new applications and services, the need to access
   information and services provided by Certificate Service Providers
   (CSPs) is critical.  Currently Certification Authorities (CAs) barely
   publish access details on their official web sites, this includes URL
   of provided services and repositories.

   Using the PRQP, resources provided by a CA can be automatically and
   securely discovered by an application.

2.1.  Overview of existing solutions

   Currently there are three options to find URLs providing access to
   PKI data:

   o  by including such data in certificate extensions

   o  by searching easily accessible repositories (e.g.  DNS, local
      database, etc.)

   o  by adapting existing protocols (e.g.  SLP)

2.1.1.  Certificate Extensions

   To provide pointers to published data it is possible to use the
   Authority Information Access (AIA) Subject Information Access (SIA)
   extensions defined by PKIX [RFC3280].

   The former can provide information about services associated with the
   issuer of the certificate, while the latter carries information
   (inside a CA certificate) about offered CA services.

   AIA and SIA extensions are static, i.e. not modifiable unless the
   certificate is re-issued.  If a CA inserts the AIA extension into
   every certificate it issues, e.g., to identify the location of an
   OCSP responder, then changing that location would require re-issuance
   of all these certificates, a substantial barrier to such a change.
   If a CA certificate is self-signed and used as a trust anchor, then



Pala                     Expires January 1, 2009                [Page 3]

Internet-Draft                    PRQP                         June 2008


   re-issuing the certificate to change the content of the SIA
   extension, e.g., to reflect a change in the location of a time
   stamping server would be very disruptive.  In closed PKIs, e.g.,
   enterprises, use of these extensions may be replaced by manual
   configuration and management of this data via ad hoc means.  Because
   of the centrally controlled nature of such environments, the static
   nature of SIA and AIA extensions is not a concern.

   However in order to promote interoperability between PKIs, PRQP
   enables dynamic management of pointers to such services (e.g.,
   adding/removing or moving) without requiring changes in the
   certificate contents or third parties to manually configure services
   in their applications.  Even in closed environments, PRQP could help
   manage PKI services analogous the way DHCP facilitates network
   management.

2.1.2.  DNS SRV records

   The SRV record technique provides pointers to servers via the DNS
   [RFC1035].

   As defined in [RFC2782], the introduction of this type of record
   allows administrators to perform operations similar to what we
   require in order to solve the problem we are addressing in this
   draft, i.e., to provide URLs to services.

   The problem in the adoption of this mechanism is that, in contrast to
   the DNS environment, usually in PKIX there is no fixed mapping
   between certificates and the DNS name space.  The only exception is
   when the Domain Component (DC) attributes are used in the
   certificate's Subject.

   Currently this approach is not widely adopted.  Moreover, it is not
   always easy to identify the right DNS to query to, when trying to
   find a particular service provided by a CA, because of the lack of
   such information in certificates.

2.1.3.  Local Network Oriented Solutions

   Another approach to provide reliable information is to use existing
   protocols for service location such as Jini, Universal Plug and Play
   protocol (UPnP) or Service Location Protocol (SLP) [RFC2608]
   [RFC2609].

   The IETF defined the SLP to provide a service location mechanism that
   is language and technology independent.  Some issues, however, make
   it not the right choice to solve our problem, e.g., the protocol is
   quite complex to implement when considering the scope of the problem

   we are addressing.

   The definition of a specific and simple protocol for PKI service and
   resource location is needed to ease PKI integration into existing and
   future applications, especially for mobile devices which have limited
   computational power and communication bandwidth.


3.  Protocol Details

   The PRQP protocol is a request-response protocol, formed by the
   exchanging of two messages, i.e., a request and a response between a
   client and a server, called the Resource Query Authority (RQA).

   The requesting entity (the client) may be any entity that needs to
   access information about repositories and services related to a
   certificate.

   The RQA is the authority entitled to answer for a particular CA or to
   act as a PRQP Trusted Authority (PTA) for a set of users, e.g., users
   in an enterprise environment.

   In the first case the RQA is directly designated by a CA to act as an
   RQA, by having the CA issue a certificate to the RQA with a specific
   value set in the extendedKeyUsage extension.  In this case the RQA
   provides authoritative responses for requests regarding the CA that
   issued the RQA's certificate.

   When operating as a PTA, the RQA may provide responses about multiple
   CAs, without the need to have been directly certified by them.  To
   operate as such, a specific extension (prqpTrustedAuthority) should
   be present in RQA's certificate and its value should be set to TRUE.

3.1.  The Resource Query Authority (RQA)

   The Resource Query Authority is the designated authority to act as
   PRQP responder.  The RQA's signing key needs not to be the same as
   that of the CA that designated it.

   The CA may designate an RQA by issuing a certificate containing a
   unique value for the extendedKeyUsage in RQA's certificate.  The RQA
   may also act as a trusted responder.  PRQP signing delegation SHALL
   be designated by the inclusion of id-kp-PRQPSigning in the
   extendedKeyUsage extension within the PRQP response signer's
   certificate.

Internet-Draft                    PRQP                         June 2008


      id-kp-PRQPSigning OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-kp 10}

   When operating as a PTA, the RQA may provide responses about multiple
   CAs, without the need to have been directly certified by them.  To
   operate as a PTA a specific extension (prqpTrustedAuthority) should
   be present in RQA's certificate and its value should be set to TRUE.

      prqpTrustedAuthority ::= BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE

   We also define two new OIDs to identify the PRQP protocol and the PTA
   extension as follows:

      id-prqp OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-pkix 23 }

      id-prqp-pta OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= { id-prqp 1 }

3.2.  PRQP Overview

   The protocol encompasses the exchange of a single round of messages
   between a client and an RQA:

   1.  the client requests a resource token by sending a request to the
       RQA

   2.  the RQA replies by sending a response to the client

   Upon receiving the response the client MUST verify the status error
   returned in the response.  If no error is present, the client MUST
   verify the various fields contained in the ResourceResponseToken and
   the validity of the associated digital signature (if present).  A
   nonce MAY be used to guarantee that the response is associated with a
   specific request in order to avoid reply attacks.

   The client also SHOULD check the validity period of the response.  It
   SHOULD NOT, in order to minimize the load on an RQA, request again
   the location of the same resource within this interval to the same
   RQA.

   If the response is signed, the client SHOULD check the RQA's
   certificate validity.

3.2.1.  PRQP Request

   A PRQP request contains the following data:

   o  protocol version

   o  nonce

   o  MaxResponse

   o  ResourceRequestToken

   o  Extensions

   The ASN.1 syntax imports terms defined in [RFC4210].  For signature
   calculation, the data to be signed is encoded by using the DER
   format.  ASN.1 EXPLICIT tagging is used as a default unless specified
   otherwise.  The terms imported from [RFC3280] are: Extensions,
   Certificate, CertificateSerialNumber, SubjectPublicKeyInfo, Name,
   AlgorithmIdentifier.

3.2.1.1.  Request Syntax

   The PRQP request syntax is as follows:

       PRQPRequest ::= SEQUENCE {
           requestData            TBSReqData,
           signature              [0] EXPLICIT Signature OPTIONAL }

       TBSReqData ::= SEQUENCE {
           version                INTEGER { v(1) },
           nonce                  INTEGER              OPTIONAL,
                 -- very large number
           maxRespEntries         INTEGER              OPTIONAL,
                 -- maximum number of accepted entries in
                 -- corresponding response
           serviceToken           ResourceRequestToken,
                 -- token identifying the requested service
           extensions         [0] IMPLICIT Extensions  OPTIONAL }

   The version field (currently v1) describes the version of the PRQP
   request.  The nonce field, if present, is an integer between 80 bits
   and 256 bit in length.

   The MaxResponse identifier is used to tell the RQA the maximum number
   of ResourceResponseToken that presenting can include in the response.

   The ResourceRequestToken is used to identify the requested services.
   It carries information about the requested services.  It contains a
   CA identifier and optionally one or more service identifiers.

         ResourceRequestToken ::= SEQUENCE {
           ca                      CertIdentifier,
           servicesList        [0] SET OF ResourceIdentifier OPTIONAL }

   The ca field is of type CertIdentifier.  This is used to identify the
   certificate of the CA whose services are requested.

   The CertIdentifier syntax is as follows:

        BasicCertIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
          issuerNameHash              OCTET STRING,
          serialNumber                CertificateSerialNumber  }

        ExtenderCertInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
          certificateHash             OCTET STRING,
          subjectKeyHash              OCTET STRING,
          subjectKeyIdentifier    [0] KeyIdentifier          OPTIONAL,
          issuerKeyIdentifier     [1] KeyIdentifier          OPTIONAL  }

        CertIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
          hashAlgorithm               AlgorithmIdentifier,
          basicCertIdentifier         BasicCertIdentifier,
          extInfo                     [0] ExtendedCertInfo    OPTIONAL,
          caCertificate               [1] Certificate         OPTIONAL,
          issuedCertificate           [2] Certificate         OPTIONAL }

   The resourceList specifies the resources or services being requested.

        ResourceIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
          resourceId             OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
          version            [0] INTEGER             OPTIONAL
            --- version of the protocol or data format (if applicable) }

   The ResourceIdentifier is formed by an OID that identifies the
   service or the data being requested (e.g.  OCSP, LDAP, CRL, etc... )
   and an optional version number that may be used to better identify
   the requested resource.  All fields SHOULD be used whenever
   applicable.

   If one or more ResourceIdentifier are provided in the request, the
   RQA should report back the location for each of the requested
   services.  If no ResourceIdentifier is present in the request, the
   response should carry all the available service locations for the
   specified CA (with respect to the MaxResponse and optional parameters
   constrain).

   The signature field is of type Signature and it is defined in
   [RFC2560]:

   Extensions can be used for future protocol enhancement.

3.2.2.  PRQP Response

   The PRQP response contains the following data:

   o  protocol version

   o  nonce

   o  status

   o  CA identifier

   o  ResourceResponseToken

   o  Extensions

3.2.2.1.  Response Syntax

               -- requested services
         extensions         [0] EXPLICIT Extensions  OPTIONAL }

   The version field (currently v1) describes the version of the used
   PRQP response.  The nonce, if present, binds the response to a
   specific request.  The usage of the nonce is meaningful only in
   signed responses and its value must be copied directly from the
   corresponding request.  If not present in the request, the nonce MUST
   be omitted.

   The pkiStatus field is based on the definition of status in section
   3.2.3 of [RFC4210].  However, to limit the complexity of the field,
   the statusString field is of type UTF8String instead of PKIFreeText.

         PKIStatusInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
           status        PKIStatus,
           statusString  [0] UTF8String     OPTIONAL,
           failInfo      [1] PKIFailureInfo  OPTIONAL  }

   If status has value zero, a responseToken MUST be present in the
   response.  When the status value is non zero, the responseToken MUST
   be omitted and the reason code MUST be one of the values in
   PKIStatus.

   The responseToken carries information about the services requested by
   the client.  For each of the requested service, the RQA should
   include a ResourceResponseToken which bears the OID of the service
   and the corresponding URI.

   The ResourceResponseToken syntax is described below:

        ResourceInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
          resourceUri            IA5String,
              --- resource locator
          version            [0] INTEGER             OPTIONAL,
              --- version of the protocol or data format (if applicable)
          }

        ResourceResponseToken ::= SEQUENCE {
          serviceId              OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
          resourceLocator    [0] EXPLICIT SEQUENCE OF ResourceInfo    }

   The serviceId field value is copied from the corresponding request
   and it bears the OID of the service about which the client inquired.
   We define the following OIDs that SHOULD be used to identify the
   specified PKI services:

   The producedAt and nextUpdate define the time-frame when the response
   data is to be considered valid.  Within the defined period, the
   client SHOULD NOT request for the same service.  Use of wider time-
   frames values can help the RQA avoid duplication of requests from the
   same client thus potentially lowering the load of the responder.
   However, providing this data to a client does not ensure a lower
   query rate, as a server cannot rely on clients to obey the advice
   provided in the rersponse.

   The resourceLocator bears access information for the service
   identified by the serviceId.  The name MUST be an absolute URL, and
   it MUST follow the URL syntax and encoding rules specified in
   [RFC4248] and [RFC4266].  The resourceLocator includes both a scheme
   (e.g., HTTP or FTP) and a scheme specific part.  The scheme specific
   part is supposed to carry information on how to reach the requested
   service, this is, for example, a fully qualified domain name or IP
   address as the host.  If the requested service is not available or it
   is unknown by the server, the resourceLocator value should be empty.

   Optional Extensions may be added if requested.

4.  PRQP Design Rationale

   In this section we provide some considerations about the protocol
   design and its details.

Internet-Draft                    PRQP                         June 2008


4.1.  Response Complexity

   An important design consideration is the complexity of messages.
   Some type of services, e.g. delta CRLs, can be directly detected upon
   data downloading.  On the contrary if a client is looking for a
   specific version of a protocol or data type, the definition of a
   fine-grained query system would allow for data downloading only when
   it is actually supported by the requesting client, thus reducing the
   server's load.

   At present we think that keeping the protocol simple will encourage
   its adoption in current environments because the flexibility
   introduced by PRQP is a big enhancement over the current options.

   Moreover, without requiring changes to the protocol, extensions could
   be defined to provide more fine grained options.

   Future versions of the protocol may implement extended request and
   response types if required by applications.

4.2.  RQA's URL distribution

   The AIA and SIA extensions in certificates can be used to carry the
   pointer to the RQA.  If no RQA address is present in the certificate,
   a client application could use a default configured URL.

   Although this approach seems to contraddict the criticism of
   Certificate extensions use in Section 2.1.1, using only one extension
   to locate the RQA would provide an easy way to distribute the RQA's
   URL.

   The usage of PRQP will provide a gateway for all the other services
   and data URLs.

4.3.  Security Considerations

   The PRQP provides URLs for PKI resources.  This means that it
   provides locators to data and services, not the data per se.  It
   still remains the client's job to access the provided URLs to gather
   the needed data.

   Both NONCEs and signatures are optional in order to provide
   flexibility in how requests and responses are generated.

   It is possible to provide pre-computed responses in case the NONCE is
   not provided by the client.  This allows the RQA to generate off-line
   signatures for responses, an optimization used in OCSP.

Internet-Draft                    PRQP                         June 2008


   Moreover if an authenticated secure channel is used at the transport
   level between the client and the RQA (e.g.  HTTPS or SFTP) signatures
   in requests and responses can be safely omitted.

4.4.  Time Validity

   The time validity should reflect the frequency of updates in
   configured URLs.  An interesting aspect to be considered is how often
   would users execute the protocol for a given set of data.

   If the clients query the server often it could be a serious burden on
   the server but, if executed rarely, clients would not be able to
   discover changes in provided resources.

   As described in more detail in Appendix A, the adoption of a validity
   time frame for responses can be used as a mean to balance the trade
   off between this two aspects, but this is merely advisory data for
   clients and thus not a guarantee against DoS attacks by clients.

4.5.  Message Format

   Two different candidates have been considered.  The first one is the
   Extensible Markup Language (XML), while the second one is the
   Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER).

   The adoption of the Abstract Syntax Notation (ASN.1) to describe the
   data structures allows a software developer to provide either DER or
   XML based implementations of the protocol.

   However we think that a DER based implementation of PRQP is the best
   choice because of compatibility considerations with existing
   applications and APIs.  Moreover DER encoded messages are smaller in
   size then XML encoded ones and almost all PKI aware applications
   already support it.

Appendix A.  Distribution of PRQP Responses

A.1.  PRQP over HTTP

   This section describes the formatting needed in order to route PRQP
   request and response over HTTP.

Internet-Draft                    PRQP                         June 2008


A.1.1.  Request

   HTTP based PRQP requests SHOULD use the POST method to submit their
   requests.  Where privacy is a requirement, PRQP transactions
   exchanged using HTTP MAY be protected using either TLS/SSL or some
   other lower layer protocol.

   The required HTTP headers for the request are:

   o  Content-Type

   o  Content-Transfer-Encoding

   o  Content-Length

   The Content-Type header SHOULD be set to "application/prqp-request".
   The Content-Transfer-Encoding SHOULD be set to "Binary", while the
   Content-Length SHOULD be set to the length (in bytes) of the body of
   the request.  The body of the HTTP message MUST carry the binary
   value of the DER encoding of the PRQPRequest.

A.1.2.  Response

   An HTTP-based PRQP response is composed of the appropriate HTTP
   headers, followed by the binary value of the DER encoding of the
   PRQPPResponse.

   The required HTTP headers for the response are:

   o  Content-Type

   o  Content-Transfer-Encoding

   o  Content-Length

   The Content-Type header SHOULD be set to "application/prqp-response".
   The Content-Transfer-Encoding SHOULD be set to "Binary", while the
   Content-Length SHOULD be set to the length (in bytes) of the body of
   the request.  The body of the HTTP message MUST carry the binary
   value of the DER encoding of the PRQPResponse.

A.1.3.  Message Caching

   To minimize bandwidth usage, clients MUST locally cache authoritative
   PRQP responses for the validity period of the request.  To enable
   proxy servers to be able to cache responses as well, additional HTTP
   headers MAY be used in the response.




Pala                     Expires January 1, 2009               [Page 17]

Internet-Draft                    PRQP                         June 2008


   The PRQP responder MAY ease caching by setting the following headers:

   o  date

   o  last-modified

   o  expires

   In particular, the date field SHOULD carry the date at which the HTTP
   response has been generated.  The last-modified, instead, SHOULD bear
   the date at which the response has been modified.  This field SHOULD
   carry the same date as the producedAt field of the PRQPResponse.  The
   expires field SHOULD carry the date till when the response is to be
   considered valid.  This field SHOULD carry the same date as in the
   nextUpdate field of the PRQPResponse.

   An example HTTP response would look like:

         HTTP/1.0 200 OK
         Content-Type: application/prqp-response
         Content-Transfer-Encoding: Binary
         Content-Length: 860
         Date: Thu, 03 May 2007 04:43:43 GMT
         Last-Modified: Thu, 03 May 2007 04:43:42 GMT
         Expires: Thu, 04 May 2007 04:43:42 GMT

         <...response data...>

   PRQP clients SUOULD NOT included a no-cache header in PRQP request
   messages, unless the client encounters an expired response which may
   be a result of an intermediate proxy caching stale data.

A.2.  PRQP over Peer-to-Peer Network

   PRQP offers a starting point for the development of a PKI Resource
   Discovery Architecture where different RQAs cooperate to access data
   not locally available.

   One technology that already provides good results in data sharing is
   Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking.

   Signed PRQP requests and responses can be routed also on existing P2P
   networks or a PRQP-specific network can be setup to provide a World
   Wide PKI Resources Discovery Architecture (PRDA), the definition of
   which is out of the scope of this document.  An example of such an
   architecture is PEACH [PEACH]
