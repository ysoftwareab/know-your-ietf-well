Abstract

This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB) for
use with network management protocols in TCP/IP based internets.  In
particular it defines objects for managing a client of the Common Open
Policy Service (COPS) protocol.

This memo includes a MIB module in a manner that is compliant to the
SNMPv2 SMI [V2SMI].

1.  The SNMP Management Framework

The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in an Architecture for
        Describing SNMP Management Frameworks [ARCH].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        RFC 1155 [V1SMI], STD 16, RFC 1212 [V1CONCISE] and RFC 1215
        [V1TRAPS].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described in
        STD 58, RFC 2578 [V2SMI], STD 58, RFC 2579 [V2TC] and STD 58,
        RFC 2580 [V2CONFORM].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [V2COMMUNITY] and RFC 1906 [V2TRANS].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC1906
        [V2TRANS], Message Processing and Dispatching [V3MPC] and User-
        based Scurity Model [V3USM].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [V1PROTO].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [V2PROTO].

    o   A set of fundamental applications described in SNMPv3
        Applications [V3APPS] and the view-based access control
        mechanism described in View-based Access Control Model [V3VACM].

A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
can be found in RFC 2570 [V3INTRO].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed the
Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are defined
using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate

translations. The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
translation is possible (use of Counter64). Some machine readable
information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
SMIv1 during the translation process. However, this loss of machine
readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
MIB.


2.  Overview

The COPS protocol [COPS] is a client-server protocol intended for the
communication of policy requests and decisions between a Policy
Enforcement Point (PEP) and a Policy Decision Point (PDP). The PEP acts
as a COPS client in this scenario.  The model for policy out-sourcing,
of which the COPS protocol provides one part, is described in
[FRAMEWORK].

2.1.  Scope

This MIB is intended to provide management of the important features of
a COPS protocol client module. It does not provide management for a COPS
server - this is outside the scope of the current memo.  It provides for
monitoring of status and protocol statistics, as well as for
configuration of the client, in particular for telling it where to
locate its servers. Other mechanisms for achieving this function without
SNMP configuration might include use of the Service Location Protocol
[SRVLOC] although this is outside the scope of this memo and are not
specified by the COPS protocol itself.

This MIB also does not provide management of specific COPS client-types
e.g. for use with the RSVP protocol [RSVP][COPSRSVP].


3.  Structure of COPS Client MIB

Objects in this MIB are arranged into groups.  Each group is organized
as a set of related objects. The overall structure is described below.

3.1.  copsClientCapabilitiesGroup

     This group contains objects that represent COPS protocol
     capabilities implemented by this COPS client.

Internet Draft               COPS Client MIB                  March 2000


3.2.  copsClientStatusGroup

     This group contains objects that indicate the current status of
     connection(s) to COPS servers, including per-server protocol
     statistics.  It maintains last-known statistics for all of the
     servers with which the client has ever been connected since agent
     restart.

3.3.  copsConfigGroup

     This group contains objects that allow for configuration of COPS
     server addresses and the order to which connections should be
     attempted. It contains a table of per-server objects as well as
     scalars for configuration of the retry algorithm to be used by a
     client to obtain a connection to an appropriate server.

3.4.  Textual Conventions

     The datatypes CopsClientState, CopsServerEntryType, CopsErrorCode,
     CopsTcpPort and CopsAuthType are used as textual conventions in
     this document.  These textual conventions have NO effect on either
     the syntax nor the semantics of any managed object.  Objects
     defined using these conventions are always encoded by means of the
     rules that define their primitive type.  Hence, no changes to the
     SMI or the SNMP are necessary to accommodate these textual
     conventions which are adopted merely for the convenience of
     readers.

3.5.  Relationship to Other MIBs

3.5.1.  Relationship to the 'system' group

     This MIB contains definitions for a single COPS protocol client
     represented by a single SNMP agent and instance of the MIB-2 system
     group [MIB2].  It does not address the case of multiple co-located
     COPS protocol clients.

4.1.  Open Issues resolved in this draft

(10) Configuration parameters for the retry algorithm are too limiting
     on implementations (no such algorithm was specified by the COPS
     protocol itself). DONE - objects which were per-server are now
     scalars; a possibly-configurable object is added to select/indicate
     the retry algorithm in use with round-robin, sequential and other
     as values.

(11) copsClientServerConfigRetryCount should be unsigned: DONE - changed
     from Integer32 to Unsigned32.

4.2.  Open Issues resolved in previous drafts

(1)  When should per-server counters (e.g. copsClientServerInPkts) be
     zeroed? Resolution: see issue (3).

(2)  Addressing of server tables by IP Address is frowned on: should
     this be indexed by a client-determined small integer? DONE - added
     InetEndpoint indices as recommended by draft-ops-endpoint-
     mib-00.txt.

(3)  Should error stats be maintained per-server or is global
     sufficient? If per-server then see also issue #1. Resolution:
     everything is per-server but not zero'ed on reconnect.

(4)  Add object to show current security in use. DONE -
     copsClientServerSecurityMode.

(5)  Do we need to be able to configure the security mode for client to
     attempt to use to talk to COPS server? DONE - added configuration
     object as an index to server configuration table. Added some more
     capabilities too.

(6)  Add TCP port number to all tables. DONE - copsClientServerTcpPort,
     copsClientServerConfigTcpPort.

(7)  Add server retry configuration. DONE -
     copsClientServerConfigRetryCount,
     copsClientServerConfigRetryInterval

(8)  Add COPS protocol version number capabilities object. DONE -
     copsClientCapabilities.

7.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that have a
MAX-ACCESS clause of read-create.  Such objects may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for

SET operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection can
have a negative effect on network operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), even then, there is no
control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and GET/SET
(read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model [USM] and the View-based Access Control Model
[VACM] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly configured to give
access to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
