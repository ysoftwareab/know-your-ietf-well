   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) as Transport for Session
                   Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
                      draft-ietf-tram-stun-dtls-05

Abstract

   This document specifies the usage of Datagram Transport Layer
   Security (DTLS) as a transport protocol for Session Traversal
   Utilities for NAT (STUN).  It provides guidances on when and how to
   use DTLS with the currently standardized STUN Usages.  It also
   specifies modifications to the STUN URIs and TURN URIs and to the
   TURN resolution mechanism to facilitate the resolution of STUN URIs
   and TURN URIs into the IP address and port of STUN and TURN servers
   supporting DTLS as a transport protocol.  This document updates RFC
   5389 and RFC 5928.

1.  Introduction

   STUN [RFC5389] defines Transport Layer Security (TLS) over TCP
   (simply referred to as TLS [RFC5246]) as the transport for STUN due
   to additional security advantages it offers over plain UDP or TCP
   transport.  But TCP (and thus TLS-over-TCP) is not an optimal
   transport when STUN is used for its originally intended purpose,
   which is to support multimedia sessions.  This is a well documented
   and understood transport limitation for real-time communications.

   DTLS-over-UDP (referred to in this document as simply DTLS [RFC6347])
   offers the same security advantages as TLS-over-TCP, but without the
   undesirable concerns.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL"
   in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119] when
   they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in ALL CAPS (such
   as "must" or "Must"), they have their usual English meanings, and are
   not to be interpreted as RFC 2119 key words.

3.  DTLS as Transport for STUN

   STUN [RFC5389] defines three transports: UDP, TCP, and TLS.  This
   document adds DTLS as a valid transport for STUN.

   STUN over DTLS MUST use the same retransmission rules as STUN over
   UDP (as described in Section 7.2.1 of [RFC5389]).  It MUST also use
   the same rules that are described in Section 7.2.2 of [RFC5389] to
   verify the server identity.  Instead of TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,
   which is the default cipher suite for STUN over TLS, implementations
   of STUN over DTLS, and deployed clients and servers, MUST support
   TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and
   TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, and MAY support other
   ciphersuites.  Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) cipher suites MUST be
   preferred over non-PFS cipher suites.  Cipher suites with known
   weaknesses, such as those based on (single) DES and RC4, MUST NOT be
   used.  Implementations MUST disable TLS-level compression.  The same
   rules established in Section 7.2.2 of [RFC5389] for keeping open and
   closing TCP/TLS connections MUST be used as well for DTLS
   associations.

Internet-Draft               STUN over DTLS                    June 2014


   In addition to the path MTU rules described in Section 7.1 of
   [RFC5389], if the path MTU is unknown, the actual STUN message needs
   to be adjusted to take into account the size of the (13-byte) DTLS
   Record header, the MAC size, and the padding size.

   By default, STUN over DTLS MUST use port 5349, the same port number
   as STUN over TLS.  However, the SRV procedures can be implemented to
   use a different port (as described in Section 9 of [RFC5389]).  When
   using SRV records, the service name MUST be set to "stuns" and the
   protocol name to "udp".

   Classic STUN [RFC3489] defines only UDP as a transport and DTLS MUST
   NOT be used.  Any STUN request or indication without the magic cookie
   (see Section 6 of [RFC5389]) over DTLS MUST always result in an
   error.

4.  STUN Usages

   [RFC5389] Section 7.2 states that STUN usages must specify which
   transport protocol is used.  The following sections discuss if and
   how the existing STUN usages are used with DTLS as the transport.
   Future STUN usages MUST take into account DTLS as a transport and
   discuss its applicability.  In all cases, new STUN usages MUST
   explicitly state if implementing the denial-of-service counter-
   measure described in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6347] is mandatory.

4.1.  NAT Discovery Usage

   As stated by Section 13 of [RFC5389], "...TLS provides minimal
   security benefits..." for this particular STUN usage.  DTLS will also
   similarly offer only limited benefit.  This is because the only
   mandatory attribute that is TLS/DTLS protected is the XOR-MAPPED-
   ADDRESS, which is already known by an on-path attacker, since it is
   the same as the source address and port of the STUN request.  On the
   other hand, using TLS/DTLS will prevent an active attacker to inject
   XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS in responses.  The TLS/DTLS transport will also
   protect the SOFTWARE attribute, which can be used to find
   vulnerabilities in STUN implementations.

   Regardless, this usage is rarely used by itself, since using TURN
   [RFC5766] with ICE [RFC5245] is generally indispensable, and TURN
   provides the same NAT Discovery feature as part of an Allocation
   creation.  In fact, with ICE, the NAT Discovery usage is only used
   when there is no longer any resource available for new Allocations in
   the TURN server.

Internet-Draft               STUN over DTLS                    June 2014


   A STUN server implementing the NAT Discovery Usage and using DTLS
   MUST implement the denial-of-service counter-measure described in
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6347].

4.1.1.  DTLS Support in STUN URIs

   This document does not make any changes to the syntax of a STUN URI
   [RFC7064].  As indicated in Section 3.2 of [RFC7064], secure
   transports like STUN over TLS, and now STUN over DTLS, MUST use the
   "stuns" URI scheme.

   The <host> value MUST be used when using the rules in Section 7.2.2
   of [RFC5389] to verify the server identity.  A STUN URI containing an
   IP address MUST be rejected, unless the domain name is provided by
   the same mechanism that provided the STUN URI, and that this domain
   name can be passed to the verification code.

4.2.  Connectivity Check Usage

   Using DTLS would hide the USERNAME, PRIORITY, USE-CANDIDATE, ICE-
   CONTROLLED and ICE-CONTROLLING attributes.  But because MESSAGE-
   INTEGRITY protects the entire STUN response using a password that is
   known only by looking at the SDP exchanged, it is not possible for an
   attacker that does not have access to this SDP to inject an incorrect
   XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS, XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS which would subsequently be
   used as a peer reflexive candidate.

   Adding DTLS on top of the connectivity check would delay, and
   consequently impair, the ICE process.  Adding additional round-trips
   to ICE is undesirable, so much that there is a proposal
   ([I-D.thomson-rtcweb-ice-dtls]) to use the DTLS handshake used by the
   WebRTC SRTP streams as a replacement for the connectivity checks.

   STUN URIs are not used with this usage.

4.3.  Media Keep-Alive Usage

   When STUN Binding Indications are being used for media keep-alive
   (described in Section 10 of [RFC5245]), it runs alongside an RTP or
   RTCP session.  It is possible to send these media keep-alive packets
   inside a separately negotiated non-SRTP DTLS session if DTLS-SRTP
   [RFC5764] is used, but that would add overhead, with minimal security
   benefit.

   STUN URIs are not used with this usage.

Internet-Draft               STUN over DTLS                    June 2014


4.4.  SIP Keep-Alive Usage

   The SIP keep-alive (described in [RFC5626]) runs inside a SIP flow.
   This flow would be protected if a SIP over DTLS transport mechanism
   is implemented (such as described in [I-D.jennings-sip-dtls]).

   STUN URIs are not used with this usage.

4.5.  NAT Behavior Discovery Usage

   The NAT Behavior Discovery usage is Experimental and to date has
   never being effectively deployed.  Despite this, using DTLS would add
   the same security properties as for the NAT Discovery Usage
   (Section 4.1).

   The STUN URI can be used to access the NAT Discovery feature of a NAT
   Behavior Discovery server, but accessing the full features would
   require definition of a "stun-behaviors:" URI, which is out of scope
   for this document.

   A STUN server implementing the NAT Behavior Discovery Usage and using
   DTLS MUST implement the denial-of-service counter-measure described
   in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6347].

4.6.  TURN Usage

   TURN [RFC5766] defines three combinations of transports/allocations:
   UDP/UDP, TCP/UDP and TLS/UDP.  This document adds DTLS/UDP as a valid
   combination.  A TURN server using DTLS MUST implement the denial-of-
   service counter-measure described in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6347].

   [RFC6062] states that TCP allocations cannot be obtained using a UDP
   association between client and server.  The fact that DTLS uses UDP
   implies that TCP allocations MUST NOT be obtained using a DTLS
   association between client and server.

   By default, TURN over DTLS uses port 5349, the same port number as
   TURN over TLS.  However, the SRV procedures can be implemented to use
   a different port (as described in Section 6 of [RFC5766].  When using
   SRV records, the service name MUST be set to "turns" and the protocol
   name to "udp".

4.6.1.  DTLS Support in TURN URIs

   This document does not make any changes to the syntax of a TURN URI
   [RFC7065].  As indicated in Section 3 of [RFC7065], secure transports
   like TURN over TLS, and now TURN over DTLS, MUST use the "turns" URI

   scheme.  When using the "turns" URI scheme to designate TURN over
   DTLS, the transport value of the TURN URI, if set, MUST be "udp".

   The <host> value MUST be used when using the rules in Section 7.2.2
   of [RFC5389] to verify the server identity.  A TURN URI containing an
   IP address MUST be rejected, unless the domain is provided by the
   same mechanism that provided the TURN URI, and that this domain name
   can be passed to the verification code.

4.6.2.  Resolution Mechanism for TURN over DTLS

   This document defines a new Straightforward Naming Authority Pointer
   (S-NAPTR) application protocol tag: "turn.dtls".

   The <transport> component, as provisioned or resulting from the
   parsing of a TURN URI, is passed without modification to the TURN
   resolution mechanism defined in Section 3 of [RFC5928], but with the
   following alterations to that algorithm:

   o  The acceptable values for transport name are extended with the
      addition of "dtls".

   o  The acceptable values in the ordered list of supported TURN
      transports is extended with the addition of "Datagram Transport
      Layer Security (DTLS)".

   o  The resolution algorithm check rules list is extended with the
      addition of the following step:

         If <secure> is true and <transport> is defined as "udp" but the
         list of TURN transports supported by the application does not
         contain DTLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an error.

   o  The 5th rule of the resolution algorithm check rules list is
      modified to read like this:

         If <secure> is true and <transport> is not defined but the list
         of TURN transports supported by the application does not
         contain TLS or DTLS, then the resolution MUST stop with an
         error.

   o  Table 1 is modified to add the following line:

                +----------+-------------+----------------+
                | <secure> | <transport> | TURN Transport |
                +----------+-------------+----------------+
                | true     | "udp"       | DTLS           |
                +----------+-------------+----------------+

   o  In step 1 of the resolution algorithm the default port for DTLS is
      5349.

   o  In step 4 of the resolution algorithm the following is added to
      the list of conversions between the filtered list of TURN
      transports supported by the application and application protocol
      tags:

         "turn.dtls" is used if the TURN transport is DTLS.

   Note that using the [RFC5928] resolution mechanism does not imply
   that additional round trips to the DNS server will be needed (e.g.,
   the TURN client will start immediately if the TURN URI contains an IP
   address).

5.  Implementation Status

   [[Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   [RFC6982] before publication.]]

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC6982].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC6982], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

6.  Security Considerations

   STUN over DTLS as a STUN transport does not introduce any specific
   security considerations beyond those for STUN over TLS detailed in
   [RFC5389].

   The usage of "udp" as a transport parameter with the "stuns" URI
   scheme does not introduce any specific security issues beyond those
   discussed in [RFC7064].

   TURN over DTLS as a TURN transport does not introduce any specific
   security considerations beyond those for TURN over TLS detailed in
   [RFC5766].

   The usage of "udp" as a transport parameter with the "turns" URI

Appendix A.  Examples

   Table 1 shows how the <secure>, <port> and <transport> components are
   populated for a TURN URI that uses DTLS as its transport.  For all
   these examples, the <host> component is populated with "example.net".

   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+
   | URI                             | <secure> | <port> | <transport> |
   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+
   | turns:example.net?transport=udp | true     |        | DTLS        |
   +---------------------------------+----------+--------+-------------+

                                  Table 1

   With the DNS RRs in Figure 1 and an ordered TURN transport list of
   {DTLS, TLS, TCP, UDP}, the resolution algorithm will convert the TURN
   URI "turns:example.net" to the ordered list of IP address, port, and
   protocol tuples in Table 2.

   o  Make clear that knowledge of the SDP is needed to be able to
      inject a false XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS.

   o  Invert the sentence about ICE round-trips to make clear that the
      cited draft is just an evidence, not an advice.

   o  Rewrite of the IANA templates for Port numbers.

   o  Remove compression from the list of element to take in accoutn to
      adjust the PMTU size, as it is now forbidden.

      dtls-04

   o  Add text to disable TLS compression.

   o  Add text to require usage of the DTLS cookie for NAT discovery and
      NAT behavior discovery.

   o  Add text to so new usages talk about cookie usage.

   o  Change TLS-over-UDP to DTLS-over-UDP and use DTLS as alias for
      DTLS over UDP..

   o  Use new text proposed by Simon Josefsson for the cipher suites.

   o  s/the same port/the same port number/

   o  s/application name/protocol name/

   o  Make clear that section 4.3 is only about the STUN Indication
      method of media keep-alive.
