Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction   September 2008


Abstract

   A Mobile IPv6 node requires a home agent address, a home address, and
   a security association with its home agent before it can start
   utilizing Mobile IPv6.  RFC 3775 requires that some or all of these
   parameters are statically configured.  Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping work
   aims to make this information dynamically available to the Mobile
   Node.  An important aspect of the Mobile IPv6 bootstrapping solution
   is to support interworking with existing authentication,
   authorization and accounting infrastructure.  This document describes
   MIPv6 bootstrapping using the Diameter Network Access Server (NAS) to
   home Authentication, Authorization and Accounting server (HAAA)
   interface.

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction   September 2008


1.  Introduction

   The Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) specification [1] requires a Mobile Node (MN)
   to perform registration with a home agent (HA) with information about
   its current point of attachment (care-of address).  The HA creates
   and maintains the binding between the MN's Home Address and the MN's
   Care-of Address.

   In order to register with a HA, the MN needs to know some information
   such as the Home Link prefix, the HA address, the Home Address(es),
   the Home Link prefix length and security association related
   information.

   The aforementioned information may be statically configured.
   However, static provisioning becomes an administrative burden for an
   operator.  Moreover, it does not address load balancing, failover,
   opportunistic home link assignment or assignment of local HAs in
   close proximity to the MN.  Also the ability to react to sudden
   environmental or topological changes is minimal.  Static provisioning
   may not be desirable, in light of these limitations.

   Dynamic assignment of MIPv6 home registration information is a
   desirable feature for ease of deployment and network maintenance.
   For this purpose, the AAA infrastructure, which is used for access
   authentication, can be leveraged to assign some or all of the
   necessary parameters.  The Diameter server in the Access Service
   Provider's (ASP) or in the Mobility Service Provider's (MSP) network
   may return these parameters to the AAA client.  Regarding the
   bootstrapping procedures, the AAA client might either be the NAS, in
   case of the integrated scenario, or the HA, in case of the split
   scenario [7].  The terms integrated and split are described in the
   terminology section and were introduced in [8] and [9].

3.  Overview

   This document addresses the authentication, authorization and
   accounting functionality required for the MIPv6 bootstrapping
   solutions outlined in [8] and focuses on the Diameter based AAA
   functionality for the NAS to HAAA communication.

   In the integrated scenario MIPv6 bootstrapping is provided as part of
   the network access authentication procedure.  Figure 1 shows the
   participating entities.

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction   September 2008


      Figure 1: Mobile IPv6 Bootstrapping in the Integrated Scenario

   In a typical MIPv6 access scenario, a MN is attached to an ASP's
   network.  During the network attachment procedure, the MN interacts
   with the NAS/Diameter client.  Subsequently, the NAS/Diameter client
   interacts with the Diameter server over the NAS to HAAA interface.

   When the Diameter server performs the authentication and
   authorization for the network access it also determines whether the
   user is authorized to the MIPv6 service.  Based on the MIPv6 service
   authorization and user's policy profile, the Diameter server may
   return several MIPv6 bootstrapping related parameters to the NAS.
   The NAS to HAAA interface described in this document is not tied to
   DHCPv6 as the only mechanism to convey MIPv6 related configuration
   parameters from the NAS/Diameter client to the mobile node.


4.  Commands, Attribute Value Pairs and Advertising Application Support

4.1.  Advertising Application Support

   This document does not define a new application.  On the other hand
   it defines a number of AVPs used in the interface between NAS to HAAA
   for the integrated scenario of MIPv6 bootstrapping.  These AVPs can
   be used with any present and future Diameter applications, where
   permitted by the command ABNF.  The examples using existing
   applications and their commands in the following sections are for
   informational purposes only.  The examples in this document reuse the
   EAP [3] application and its respective commands.

4.2.  Attribute Value Pair Definitions

4.2.1.  MIP6-Agent-Info

   The MIP6-Agent-Info AVP (AVP code TBD) is type of Grouped and
   contains necessary information to assign a HA to the MN.  When the
   MIP6-Agent-Info AVP is present in a message, it MUST contain either
   the MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP or the MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP, or
   both AVPs.  The grouped AVP has the following grammar:

   <MIP6-Agent-Info> ::= < AVP Header: TBD >
                       *2[ MIP-Home-Agent-Address ]
                         [ MIP-Home-Agent-Host ]
                       * [ AVP ]

   If both MIP-Home-Agent-Address and MIP-Home-Agent-Host APVs are
   present in the MIP6-Agent-Info, the MIP-Home-Agent-Address SHOULD
   have a precedence over the MIP-Home-Agent-Host.  The reason for this



Korhonen, et al.          Expires March 9, 2009                 [Page 6]

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction   September 2008


   recommendation is that the MIP-Home-Agent-Address points to a
   specific home agent, where as the MIP-Home-Agent-Host may point to a
   group of HAs located at within the same realm.  A Diameter client or
   an agent may use the MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP, for instance, to find
   out the realm where the HA is located.

   This AVP MAY also be attached by the NAS or by intermediating
   Diameter proxies in a request message when sent to the Diameter
   server as a hint of a locally assigned HA.  This AVP MAY also be
   attached by the intermediating Diameter proxies in a reply message
   from the Diameter server, if locally assigned HAs are authorized by
   the Diameter server.

4.2.2.  MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP

   The MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP (AVP Code 334 [4]) is of type Address
   and contains IPv6 or IPv6 address of the HA.  The Diameter server MAY
   decide to assign a HA to the MN that is in close proximity to the
   point of attachment (e.g., determined by the NAS-Identifier AVP).
   There may be other reasons for dynamically assigning HAs to the MN,
   for example to share the traffic load.

4.2.3.  MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP

   The MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP (AVP Code 348 [4]) is of type Grouped and
   contains the identity of the assigned HA.  Both the Destination-Realm
   and the Destination-Host AVPs of the HA are included in the grouped
   AVP.  The usage of the MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP is equivalent to the
   MIP-Home-Agent-Address AVP but offers an additional level of
   indirection by using the DNS infrastructure.

   Depending on the actual deployment and DNS configuration the
   Destination-Host AVP MAY represent one or more home agents.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the Destination-Host AVP identifies exactly one HA.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the MIP-Home-Agent-Host AVP is always included
   in the MIP6-Agent-Info AVP.  In this way the HA address can be
   associated with the corresponding realm the HA belongs to.

4.2.4.  MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP

   The MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type OctetString
   and contains the Mobile IPv6 home network prefix information in
   network byte order.  The home network prefix MUST be encoded as the
   8-bit prefix length information followed by the 128-bit field for the
   available home network prefix.

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction   September 2008


4.2.5.  MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP

   The MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP (AVP Code TBD) is of type Unsigned64 and
   contains a 64 bit flags field of supported capabilities of the NAS/
   ASP.  Sending and receiving the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP with value 0
   MUST be supported, although that does not provide much guidance about
   specific needs of bootstrapping.

   The NAS MAY include this AVP to indicate capabilities of the NAS/ASP
   to the Diameter server.  For example, the NAS may indicate that a
   local HA can be provided.  Similarly, the Diameter server MAY include
   this AVP to inform the NAS/ASP about which of the NAS/ASP indicated
   capabilities are supported or authorized by the ASA/MSA(/MSP).

   The following capabilities are defined in this document:


   MIP6_INTEGRATED (0x0000000000000001)

      When this flag is set by the NAS then it means that the Mobile
      IPv6 integrated scenario bootstrapping functionality is supported
      by the NAS.  When this flag is set by the Diameter server then the
      Mobile IPv6 integrated scenario bootstrapping is supported by the
      Diameter server.

   LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT (0x0000000000000002)

      When this flag is set in the request message, a local home agent
      outside the home realm is requested and may be assigned to the MN.
      When this flag is set by the Diameter server in the answer
      message, then the assignment of local HAs is authorized by the
      Diameter server.

      A local HA may be assigned by the NAS, LAAA or VAAA depending on
      the network architecture and the deployment.

   The following examples show how the LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT
   (referred as LOCAL-bit in the examples) capability and the MIP-Agent-
   Info AVP (referred as HA-Info in the examples) are used to assign
   HAs, either a local HA (L-HA) or a home network HA (H-HA).  Below is
   an example of a request message combinations as seen by the HAAA:

    LOCAL-bit  HA-Info  Meaning

      0          -      ASP or [LV]AAA is not able to assign a L-HA
      0         L-HA    Same as above. HA-Info must be ignored
      1          -      ASP or [LV]AAA can/wishes to assign a L-HA
      1         L-HA    Same as above but ASP or [LV]AAA also

Internet-Draft   Diameter MIPv6 NAS to HAAA Interaction   September 2008


                        provides a hint of the assigned L-HA

   Then the same as above for an answer message combinations as seen by
   the NAS:

    LOCAL-bit  HA-Info  Meaning

      0          -      No HA allowed -> no mobility
      0         H-HA    L-HA is not allowed. HAAA assigns a H-HA
      1          -      L-HA is allowed. No HAAA or [LV]AAA assigned HA
      1         L-HA    L-HA is allowed. [LV]AAA also assigns a L-HA
      1         H-HA    L-HA is allowed. HAAA also assigns a HA
      1         H-HA    L-HA is allowed. HAAA assigns a H-HA and
              + L-HA    [LV]AAA also assigns also a L-HA

   A NAS should expect to possible receive multiple of the MIP6-Agent-
   Info AVPs.


5.  Examples

5.1.  Home Agent Assignment by the NAS

   In this scenario we consider the case where the NAS wishes to
   allocate a local HA to the MN.  The NAS will also inform the Diameter
   server about the HA address it has assigned to the visiting MN (e.g.,
   2001:db8:1:c020::1).  The Diameter-EAP-Request message therefore has
   the MIP6-Feature-Vector with the LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT and the
   MIP6_INTEGRATED set.  The MIP6-Agent-Info AVP contains the MIP-Home-
   Agent-Address AVP with the address of the proposed HA.

                  Figure 2: Home Agent Assignment by NAS

   Depending on the Diameter server configuration and user's
   subscription profile, the Diameter server either accepts or rejects
   the local HA allocated by the NAS.  In our example, the Diameter
   server accepts the proposal and the the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP with
   LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT flag (together with the MIP6_INTEGRATED
   flag) is set and returned to the NAS.

5.2.  Home Agent Assignment by the Diameter Server

   In this scenario we consider the case where the NAS supports the
   Diameter MIPv6 integrated scenario as defined in this document but
   does not offer local HA assignment.  Hence, the MIP6-Feature-Vector
   AVP only has the MIP6_INTEGRATED flag set.  The Diameter server
   allocates a HA to the mobile node and conveys the address in the MIP-
   Home-Agent-Address AVP that is encapsulated in the MIP6-Agent-Info
   AVP.  Additionally, the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP has the
   MIP6_INTEGRATED flag set.

            Figure 3: Home Agent Assignment by Diameter Server

5.3.  Home Agent Assignment by NAS or Diameter Server

   This section shows another message flow for the MIPv6 integrated
   scenario bootstrapping where the NAS informs the Diameter server that
   it is able to locally assign a HA to the MN.  The Diameter server is
   able to provide a HA to the MN but also authorizes the assignment of
   local HA.  The Diameter server then replies to the NAS with HA
   related bootstrapping information.

   Whether the NAS/ASP then offers a locally assigned HA or the Diameter
   server assigned HA to the MN is, in this example, based on the local
   ASP policy.

   If the Diameter server does not allow the MN to use a locally
   assigned HA, the Diameter returns the MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP with
   the LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT bit unset and HA address it allocated
   to the MN.

   along with a specification determining how many of each new AVP may
   be included in a Diameter command.  They may be present in any
   Diameter application request and answer commands, where permitted by
   the command ABNF.

7.  IANA Considerations

7.1.  Registration of new AVPs

   This specification defines the following new AVPs:

     MIP6-Agent-Info                is set to TBD
     MIP6-Feature-Vector            is set to TBD
     MIP6-Home-Link-Prefix          is set to TBD

7.2.  New Registry: Mobility Capability

   IANA is requested to create a new registry for the Mobility
   Capability as described in Section 4.2.5.

  Token                             | Value                | Description
  ----------------------------------+----------------------+------------
  MIP6_INTEGRATED                   | 0x0000000000000001   | [RFC TBD]
  LOCAL_HOME_AGENT_ASSIGNMENT       | 0x0000000000000002   | [RFC TBD]
  Available for Assignment via IANA | 2^x                  |

   Allocation rule: Only numeric values that are 2^x (power of two,
   where x >= 2) are allowed based on the allocation policy described
   below.

   Following the example policies described in [11] new values for the
   MIP6-Feature-Vector AVP will be assigned based on the "Specification
   Required" policy.  No mechanism to mark entries as "deprecated" is
   envisioned.


8.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the Diameter interaction required to
   accomplish the integrated scenario are described in [12].

   Additionally, the security considerations of the Diameter base
   protocol [5], Diameter NASREQ application [6] / Diameter EAP [3]
   application (with respect to network access authentication and the
   transport of keying material) are applicable to this document.
   Developers should insure that special attention is paid to
   configuring the security associations protecting the messages that
   enables the global positioning and allocation of home agents, for
   instance, as outlined in section 5.
