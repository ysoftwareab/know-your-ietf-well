Abstract

   To reduce the likelihood of conflict and confusion when relating
   documented examples to deployed systems, an IPv6 unicast prefix is
   reserved for use in examples in RFCs, books, documentation, and the
   like. Since site-local and link- local unicast addresses have special
   meaning in IPv6, these addresses cannot be used in many example
   situations. The document describes the use of the IPv6 address prefix
   2001:0DB8::/32 as a reserved prefix for use in documentation.

Internet-Draft         IPv6 Documentation Address           January 2004


1. Introduction

   The address architecture for IPv6 [1] does not specifically allocate
   an IPv6 address prefix for use for documentation purposes.
   Documentation material is currently using address prefixes drawn from
   address blocks already allocated or assigned to existing
   organizations or to well known ISPs, or drawn from the currently
   unallocated address pool. Such use conflicts with existing or future
   allocations or assignments of IPv6 address space.

   The problems such conflicts may cause have already been encountered
   with IPv4 where literal use of documented examples in a production
   environment causes address and routing conflicts with existing
   services. In making an explicit allocation of a documentation address
   prefix, it is intended that such operational problems may be avoided
   for IPv6.

   Similar, but different, discussion also applies to top level domain
   names and some have been reserved for similar purposes.  [2]

2. Documentation IPv6 Address Prefix

   To allow documentation to accurately describe deployment examples the
   use of site local or link local addresses is inappropriate, and a
   unicast address block is required. All IPv6 unicast address space is
   currently marked as reserved, unassigned or has been assigned to IANA
   for further redistribution to RIRs [1], but no unicast address space
   has been specifically nominated for the purposes of use in documented
   examples.

   Following acceptance within APNIC's addressing community of a
   proposal for a block of IPv6 address space to be created for
   documentation purposes, APNIC allocated a unicast address prefix for
   documentation purposes. The address block is within the range of a
   conventional allocation size, so that documentation can accurately
   match deployment scenarios.

   Multicast addresses can also be reserved for documentation using this
   document reserved address space together with the Unicast
   prefix-based proposal [3] for multicast addresses.

   The prefix allocated for documentation purposes is 2001:0DB8::/32

3. Operational Implications

   This assignment implies that IPv6 network operators should add this
   address block to the list of non-routeable IPv6 address space, and if
   packet filters are deployed, then this address should be added to

   packet filters.

   This not a local-use address block, and the filters may be used in
   both local and public contexts.

4. IANA Considerations

   IANA is to record the allocation of the IPv6 global unicast address
   prefix  2001:0DB8::/32 as a documentation-only prefix  in the IPv6
   address registry. No end party is to be assigned this address.

5. Security Considerations

   IPv6 addressing documents do not have any direct impact on Internet
   infrastructure security.  Authentication of IPv6 packets is defined
   in [4].

6. Acknowledgements

   The authors acknowledge the work of Marc Blanchet, assisted by Alain
   Durand, Robert Elz, Bob Fink and Dave Thaler, in authoring a previous
   proposal for a V6 documentation prefix.
