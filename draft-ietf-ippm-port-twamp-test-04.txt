1.  Introduction

   The IETF IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) working group first developed
   the One-Way Active Measurement Protocol, OWAMP, specified in
   [RFC4656].  Further protocol development to support testing resulted
   in the Two-Way Active Measurement Protocol, TWAMP, specified in
   [RFC5357].

   Both OWAMP and TWAMP require the implementation of a control and mode
   negotiation protocol (OWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Control) which employs
   the reliable transport services of TCP (including security
   configuration and key derivation).  The control protocols arrange for
   the configuration and management of test sessions using the
   associated test protocol (OWAMP-Test or TWAMP-Test) on UDP transport.

   In this memo, IETF recognizes the value of assigning a well-known UDP
   port to the *-Test protocols, and that this goal can easily be
   arranged through port re-assignments.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

3.  Scope

   The scope of this memo is to re-allocate well-known ports for the UDP
   Test protocols that compose necessary parts of their respective
   standards track protocols, OWAMP and TWAMP, along with clarifications
   of the complete protocol composition for the industry.

   The memo updates [RFC4656] and [RFC5357], in terms of the UDP well-
   known port assignments.

4.  Definitions and Background

   This section defines key terms and clarifies the required composition
   of the OWAMP and TWAMP standards-track protocols.

   OWAMP-Control is the protocol defined in Section 3 of [RFC4656].

   OWAMP-Test is the protocol defined in Section 4 of [RFC4656].

   OWAMP is described in a direct quote from Section 1.1 of[RFC4656]:
   "OWAMP actually consists of two inter-related protocols: OWAMP-
   Control and OWAMP-Test."  A similar sentence appears in Section 2 of
   [RFC4656].  For avoidance of doubt, implementation of both OWAMP-
   Control and OWAMP-Test are REQUIRED for standards-track OWAMP
   specified in [RFC4656] (aplying the consensus of many dictionary
   definitions of "consist").

   TWAMP-Control is the protocol defined in Section 3 of [RFC5357].

   TWAMP-Test is the protocol defined in Section 4 of [RFC5357].

   TWAMP is described in a direct quote from Section 1.1 of [RFC5357]:
   "Similar to OWAMP [RFC4656], TWAMP consists of two inter-related
   protocols: TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test."  For avoidance of doubt,
   implementation of both TWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Test are REQUIRED for
   standards-track TWAMP specified in [RFC5357] (aplying the consensus
   of many dictionary definitions of "consist").

   TWAMP Light is an idea described in Informative Appendix I of
   [RFC5357], and includes an un-specified control protocol combined



Morton & Mirsky           Expires June 12, 2019                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft             *WAMP W-K UDP Ports             December 2018


   with the TWAMP-Test protocol.  The TWAMP Light idea was relegated to
   the Appendix because it failed to meet the requirements for IETF
   protocols (there are no specifications for negotiating this form of
   operation, and no specifications for mandatory-to-implement security
   features), as described in Appendix A of this memo, which cites
   [LarsAD] and [TimDISCUSS] .

   Since the idea of TWAMP Light clearly includes the TWAMP-Test
   component of TWAMP, it is considered reasonable for future systems to
   use the TWAMP-Test well-known UDP port (whose re-allocated assignment
   is requested here).  Clearly, the TWAMP Light idea envisions many
   components and communication capabilities beyond TWAMP-Test
   (implementing the security requirements, for example), otherwise
   Appendix I of [RFC5357] would be one sentence long (equivocating
   TWAMP Light with TWAMP-Test only).

5.  New Well-Known Ports

   Originally, both TCP and UDP well-known ports were assigned to the
   control protocols that are essential components of standards track
   OWAMP and TWAMP.

   Since OWAMP-Control and TWAMP-Control require TCP transport, they
   cannot make use of the UDP ports which were originally assigned.
   However, test sessions using OWAMP-Test or TWAMP-Test operate on UDP
   transport.

   This memo requests re-assignment of the UDP well-known port from the
   Control protocol to the Test protocol (see the IANA Considerations
   Section 7).  Use of this UDP port is OPTIONAL in standards-track
   OWAMP and TWAMP.  It may simplify some operations to have a well-
   known port available for the Test protocols, or for future
   specifications involving TWAMP-Test to use this port as a default
   port.  For example, [TR-390] is a specification for testing at the
   customer edge of IP networks, and whose implememntations should
   benefit.

5.1.  Impact on TWAMP-Control Protocol

   Section 3.5 [RFC5357] describes the detailed process of negotiating
   the Receiver Port number, on which the TWAMP Session-Reflector will
   send and receive TWAMP-Test packets.  The Control-Client, acting on
   behalf of the Session-Sender, proposes the Receiver port number from
   the Dynamic Port range [RFC6335]:

      "The Receiver Port is the desired UDP port to which TWAMP-Test
      packets will be sent by the Session-Sender (the port where the
      Session-Reflector is asked to receive test packets).  The Receiver



Morton & Mirsky           Expires June 12, 2019                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft             *WAMP W-K UDP Ports             December 2018


      Port is also the UDP port from which TWAMP-Test packets will be
      sent by the Session-Reflector (the Session-Reflector will use the
      same UDP port to send and receive packets)."

   It is possible that the proposed Receiver Port may be not available,
   e.g., the port is in use by another test session or another
   application.  In this case:

      "... the Server at the Session-Reflector MAY suggest an alternate
      and available port for this session in the Port field.  The
      Control-Client either accepts the alternate port, or composes a
      new Session-Request message with suitable parameters.  Otherwise,
      the Server uses the Accept field to convey other forms of session
      rejection or failure to the Control Client and MUST NOT suggest an
      alternate port; in this case, the Port field MUST be set to zero."

   A Control Client that supports use of the allocated TWAMP-Test
   Receiver Port Section 7 MAY request to use that port number in the
   Request-TW-Session Command.  If the Server does not support the
   allocated TWAMP-Test Receiver Port, then it sends an alternate port
   number in the Accept-Session message with Accept field = 0.  Thus the
   deployment of the allocated TWAMP Receiver Port number is backward
   compatible with existing TWAMP-Control solutions that are based on
   [RFC5357].  Of course, use of a UDP port number chosen from the
   Dynamic Port range [RFC6335] will help to avoid the situation when
   the Control-Client or Server finds the proposed port being already in
   use.

5.2.  Impact on OWAMP-Control Protocol

   As described above, an OWAMP Control Client that supports use of the
   allocated OWAMP-Test Receiver Port Section 7 MAY request to use that
   port number in the Request-Session Command.  If the Server does not
   support the allocated OWAMP-Test Receiver Port (or does not have the
   port available), then it sends an alternate port number in the
   Accept-Session message with Accept field = 0.  Further exchanges
   proceed as already specified.

5.3.  Impact on OWAMP/TWAMP-Test Protocols

   OWAMP/TWAMP-Test may be used to measure IP performance metrics in an
   Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) environment.  Though algorithms to
   balance IP flows among available paths have not been standardized,
   the most common is the five-tuple that uses destination IP address,
   source IP address, protocol type, destination port number, and source
   port number.  When attempting to monitor different paths in ECMP
   network, it is sufficient to vary only one of five parameters, e.g.
   the source port number.  Thus, there will be no negative impact on

Internet-Draft             *WAMP W-K UDP Ports             December 2018


   ability to arrange concurrent OWAMP/TWAMP test sessions between the
   same test points to monitor different paths in the ECMP network when
   using the re-allocated UDP port number as the Receiver Port, as use
   of the port is optional.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations that apply to any active measurement of
   live paths are relevant here as well (see [RFC4656] and [RFC5357]).

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, the sensitive information available to
   potential observers is greatly reduced when using active techniques
   which are within this scope of work.  Passive observations of user
   traffic for measurement purposes raise many privacy issues.  We refer
   the reader to the security and privacy considerations described in
   the Large Scale Measurement of Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework
   [RFC7594], which covers both active and passive techniques.

   The registered UDP port as the Receiver Port for OWAMP/TWAMP-Test
   could become a target of denial-of-service (DoS), or used to aid man-
   in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  To improve protection from the DoS
   following methods are recommended:

   o  filtering access to the OWAMP/TWAMP Receiver Port by access list;

   o  using a non-globally routable IP address for the OWAMP/TWAMP
      Session-Reflector address.

   A MITM attack may try to modify the content of the OWAMP/TWAMP-Test
   packets in order to alter the measurement results.  However, an
   implementation can use authenticated mode to detect modification of
   data.  In addition, use encrypted mode to prevent eavesdropping and
   un-detected modification of the OWAMP/TWAMP-Test packets.

   There is also a risk of a network under test giving special treatment
   to flows involving the well-known UDP port, with or without knowing
   source and destination addresses of measurement systems, and thus
   biasing the results through preferential or detrimental processing.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests re-allocation of two UDP port numbers from the
   System Ports range [RFC6335].  Specifically, this memo requests that
   IANA re-allocate UDP ports 861 and 862 as shown below, leaving the
   TCP port assignments as-is:

9.  Appendix A

   This informative Appendix provides the Background on the decision to
   move the TWAMP Light idea to an informative Appendix in [RFC5357].

   The TWAMP Light idea was relegated to the Appendix because it failed
   to meet the requirements for IETF protocols (there are no
   specifications for negotiating this form of operation, and no
   specifications for mandatory-to-implement security features), as
   described in the references below:

   o  Lars Eggert's Area Director review [LarsAD], where he pointed out
      that having two variants of TWAMP, Light and Complete (called
      standards track TWAMP here), required a protocol mechanism to
      negotiate which variant will be used.  See Lars' comment on Sec
      5.2.  The working group consensus was to place the TWAMP Light
      description in Appendix I, and to refer to the Appendix only as an

      "incremental path to adopting TWAMP, by implementing the TWAMP-
      Test protocol first".

   o  Tim Polk's DISCUSS Ballot, which points out that TWAMP Light was
      an incomplete specification because the key required for
      authenticated and encrypted modes depended on the TWAMP-Control
      Session key.  See Tim's DISCUSS on 2008-07-16 [TimDISCUSS].
      Additional requirement statements were added in the Appendix to
      address Tim's DISCUSS Ballot (see the last three paragraphs of
      Appendix I in [RFC5357]).

   Since the idea of TWAMP Light clearly includes the TWAMP-Test
   protocol and other undefined facilities, Appendix I of [RFC5357]
   simply describes ideas of how TWAMP-Test might be used ouside of the
   context of Standards-Track TWAMP.
