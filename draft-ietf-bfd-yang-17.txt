1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model that can be used to configure
   and manage Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) [RFC5880].  BFD
   is a network protocol which is used for liveness detection of
   arbitrary paths between systems.  Some examples of different types of
   paths over which we have BFD:

   1) Two systems directly connected via IP.  This is known as BFD over
   single-hop IP, a.k.a.  BFD for IPv4 and IPv6 [RFC5881]

   2) Two systems connected via multiple hops as described in BFD for
   Multiple Hops.  [RFC5883]

   3) Two systems connected via MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs) as
   described in BFD for MPLS LSP [RFC5884]

   4) Two systems connected via a Link Aggregation Group (LAG) interface
   as described in BFD on LAG Interfaces [RFC7130]

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                     August 2018


   5) Two systems connected via pseudowires (PWs), this is known as
   Virtual Circuit Connectivity Verification (VCCV) as described in BFD
   for PW VCCV [RFC5885].  This is not addressed in this document.

   BFD typically does not operate on its own.  Various control
   protocols, also known as BFD clients, use the services provided by
   BFD for their own operation as described in Generic Application of
   BFD [RFC5882].  The obvious candidates which use BFD are those which
   do not have "hellos" to detect failures, e.g. static routes, and
   routing protocols whose "hellos" do not support sub-second failure
   detection, e.g.  OSPF and IS-IS.

   The YANG modules in this document conform to the Network Management
   Datastore Architecture (NMDA) [RFC8342].  This means that the data
   models do not have separate top-level or sibling containers for
   configuration and operational state data.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119]
   [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown
   here.

1.2.  Tree Diagrams

   This document uses the graphical representation of data models
   defined in [RFC8340].

2.  Design of the Data Model

   Since BFD is used for liveliness detection of various forwarding
   paths, there is no uniform key to identify a BFD session, and so the
   BFD data model is split in multiple YANG modules where each module
   corresponds to one type of forwarding path.  For example, BFD for IP
   single-hop is in one YANG module and BFD for MPLS-TE is in another
   YANG module.  The main difference between these modules is how a BFD
   session is uniquely identified, i.e the key for the list containing
   the BFD sessions for that forwarding path.  To avoid duplication of
   BFD definitions, we have common types and groupings which are used by
   all the modules.

   A new control-plane protocol "bfdv1" is defined and a "bfd" container
   is created under control-plane-protocol as specified in "A YANG Data
   Model for Routing Management (NMDA Version)" [RFC8349].  This new
   "bfd" container is augmented by all the YANG modules for their
   respective specific information:

   1.  ietf-bfd-ip-sh.yang augments "/routing/control-plane-protocols/
       control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with the "ip-sh" container for BFD
       sessions over IP single-hop.

   2.  ietf-bfd-ip-mh.yang augments "/routing/control-plane-protocols/
       control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with the "ip-mh" container for BFD
       sessions over IP multi-hop.

   3.  ietf-bfd-lag.yang augments "/routing/control-plane-protocols/
       control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with the "lag" container for BFD
       sessions over LAG.

   4.  ietf-bfd-mpls.yang augments "/routing/control-plane-protocols/
       control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with the "mpls" container for BFD
       over MPLS LSPs.

   5.  ietf-bfd-mpls-te.yang augments "/routing/control-plane-protocols/
       control-plane-protocol/bfd/" with the "mpls-te" container for BFD
       over MPLS-TE.

   BFD can operate in the following contexts:

   1.  At the network device level

   2.  In Logical Network Elements as described in YANG Logical Network
       Element [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-lne-model]

   3.  In Network Instances as described in YANG Logical Network Element
       [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-ni-model]

   When used at the network device level, the BFD YANG model is used
   "as-is".  When the BFD YANG model is used in a Logical Network
   Element or in a Network Instance, then the BFD YANG model augments
   the mounted routing model for the Logical Network Element or the
   Network Instance.

2.1.  Design of Configuration Model

   The configuration model consists mainly of the parameters specified
   in BFD [RFC5880].  Some examples are desired minimum transmit
   interval, required minimum receive interval, detection multiplier,
   etc

   BFD clients are applications that use BFD for fast detection of
   failures.  Some implementations have BFD session configuration under
   the BFD clients.  For example, BFD session configuration under
   routing applications such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP etc.  Other

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                     August 2018


   implementations have BFD session configuration centralized under BFD,
   i.e. outside the multiple BFD clients.

   The BFD parameters of interest to a BFD client are mainly the
   multiplier and interval(s) since those parameters impact the
   convergence time of the BFD clients when a failure occurs.  Other
   parameters such as BFD authentication are not specific to the
   requirements of the BFD client.  Ideally all configuration should be
   centralized under BFD.  However, this is a problem for clients of BFD
   which auto-discover their peers.  For example, IGPs do not have the
   peer address configured, instead the IGP is enabled on an interface
   and the IGP peers are auto-discovered.  So for an operator to
   configure BFD to an IGP peer, the operator would first have to
   determine the peer addresses.  And when a new peer is discovered, BFD
   configuration would need to be added.  To avoid this issue, we define
   grouping client-cfg-parms in Section 2.13 for BFD clients to
   configure BFD: this allows BFD clients such as the IGPs to have
   configuration (multiplier and intervals) for the BFD sessions they
   need.  For example, when a new IGP peer is discovered, the IGP would
   create a BFD session to the newly discovered peer and similarly when
   an IGP peer goes away, the IGP would remove the BFD session to that
   peer.  The mechanism how the BFD sessions are created and removed by
   the BFD clients is outside the scope of this document, but typically
   this would be done by use of an API implemented by the BFD module on
   the system.  For BFD clients which create BFD sessions via their own
   configuration, authentication parameters (if required) are still
   specified in BFD.

2.1.1.  Common BFD configuration parameters

   The basic BFD configuration parameters are:

   local-multiplier
           This is the detection time multiplier as defined in BFD
           [RFC5880].

   desired-min-tx-interval
           This is the Desired Min TX Interval as defined in BFD
           [RFC5880].

   required-min-rx-interval
           This is the Required Min RX Interval as defined in BFD
           [RFC5880].

   Although BFD [RFC5880] allows for different values for transmit and
   receive intervals, some implementations allow users to specify just
   one interval which is used for both transmit and receive intervals or
   separate values for transmit and receive intervals.  The BFD YANG

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                     August 2018


   model supports this: there is a choice between "min-interval", used
   for both transmit and receive intervals, and "desired-min-tx-
   interval" and "required-min-rx-interval".  This is supported via a
   grouping which is used by the YANG modules for the various forwarding
   paths.

   For BFD authentication we have:

   key-chain
           This is a reference to key-chain defined in YANG Data Model
           for Key Chains [RFC8177].  The keys, cryptographic
           algorithms, key lifetime etc are all defined in the key-chain
           model.

   meticulous
           This enables meticulous mode as per BFD [RFC5880].

2.1.2.  Single-hop IP

   For single-hop IP, there is an augment of the "bfd" data node in
   Section 2.  The "ip-sh" node contains a list of IP single-hop
   sessions where each session is uniquely identified by the interface
   and destination address pair.  For the configuration parameters we
   use what is defined in Section 2.1.1.  The "ip-sh" node also contains
   a list of interfaces, this is used to specify authentication
   parameters for BFD sessions which are created by BFD clients, see
   Section 2.1.

   [RFC5880] and [RFC5881] do not specify whether echo function is
   continuous or on demand.  Therefore the mechanism used to start and
   stop echo function is implementation specific and should be done by
   augmentation:

      1) Configuration.  This is suitable for continuous echo function.
      An example is provided in Appendix A.

      2) RPC.  This is suitable for on-demand echo function.

2.1.3.  Multihop IP

   For multihop IP, there is an augment of the "bfd" data node in
   Section 2.

   Because of multiple paths, there could be multiple multihop IP
   sessions between a source and a destination address.  We identify
   this as a "session-group".  The key for each "session-group" consists
   of:

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                     August 2018


   source address
           Address belonging to the local system as per BFD for Multiple
           Hops [RFC5883]

   destination address
           Address belonging to the remote system as per BFD for
           Multiple Hops [RFC5883]

   For the configuration parameters we use what is defined in
   Section 2.1.1

   Here are some extra parameters:

   tx-ttl
           TTL of outgoing BFD control packets.

   rx-ttl
           Minimum TTL of incoming BFD control packets.

2.1.4.  MPLS Traffic Engineering Tunnels

   For MPLS-TE tunnels, BFD is configured under the MPLS-TE tunnel since
   the desired failure detection parameters are a property of the MPLS-
   TE tunnel.  This is achieved by augmenting the MPLS-TE data model in
   YANG Data Model for TE Topologies [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te].  For BFD
   parameters which are specific to the TE application, e.g. whether to
   tear down the tunnel in the event of a BFD session failure, these
   parameters will be defined in the YANG model of the MPLS-TE
   application.

   On top of the usual BFD parameters, we have the following per MPLS-TE
   tunnel:

   encap
           Encapsulation for the BFD packets: choice between IP, G-ACh
           and IP with G-ACh as per MPLS Generic Associated Channel
           [RFC5586]

   For general MPLS-TE data, "mpls-te" data node is added under the
   "bfd" node in Section 2.  Since some MPLS-TE tunnels are uni-
   directional there is no MPLS-TE configuration for these tunnels on
   the egress node (note that this does not apply to bi-directional
   MPLS-TP tunnels).  The BFD parameters for the egress node are added
   under "mpls-te".

Internet-Draft                  BFD YANG                     August 2018


2.1.5.  MPLS Label Switched Paths

   Here we address MPLS LSPs whose FEC is an IP address.  The "bfd" node
   in Section 2 is augmented with "mpls" which contains a list of
   sessions uniquely identified by an IP prefix.  Because of multiple
   paths, there could be multiple MPLS sessions to an MPLS FEC.  We
   identify this as a "session-group".

   Since these LSPs are uni-directional there is no LSP configuration on
   the egress node.

   The BFD parameters for the egress node are added under "mpls".

2.1.6.  Link Aggregation Groups

   Per BFD on LAG Interfaces [RFC7130], configuring BFD on LAG consists
   of having micro-BFD sessions on each LAG member link.  Since the BFD
   parameters are an attribute of the LAG, they should be under the LAG.
   However there is no LAG YANG model which we can augment.  So a "lag"
   data node is added to the "bfd" node in Section 2, the configuration
   is per-LAG: we have a list of LAGs.  The destination IP address of
   the micro-BFD sessions is configured per-LAG and per address-family
   (IPv4 and IPv6)

2.2.  Design of Operational State Model

   The operational state model contains both the overall statistics of
   BFD sessions running on the device and the per session operational
   information.

   The overall statistics of BFD sessions consist of number of BFD
   sessions, number of BFD sessions up etc.  This information is
   available globally (i.e. for all BFD sessions) under the "bfd" node
   in Section 2 and also per type of forwarding path.

   For each BFD session, mainly three categories of operational state
   data are shown.  The fundamental information of a BFD session such as
   the local discriminator, remote discriminator and the capability of
   supporting demand detect mode are shown in the first category.  The
   second category includes a BFD session running information, e.g. the
   remote BFD state and the diagnostic code received.  Another example
   is the actual transmit interval between the control packets, which
   may be different from the desired minimum transmit interval
   configured, is shown in this category.  Similar examples are actual
   received interval between the control packets and the actual transmit
   interval between the echo packets.  The third category contains the
   detailed statistics of the session, e.g. when the session
   transitioned up/down and how long it has been in that state.

   For some path types, there may be more than 1 session on the virtual
   path to the destination.  For example, with IP multihop and MPLS
   LSPs, there could be multiple BFD sessions from the source to the
   same destination to test the various paths (ECMP) to the destination.
   This is represented by having multiple "sessions" under each
   "session-group".

2.3.  Notifications

   This YANG model defines notifications to inform end-users of
   important events detected during the protocol operation.  Pair of
   local and remote discriminator identifies a BFD session on local
   system.  Notifications also give more important details about BFD
   sessions; e.g. new state, time in previous state, network-instance
   and the reason that the BFD session state changed.  The notifications
   are defined for each type of forwarding path but use groupings for
   common information.

2.4.  RPC Operations

   None.

2.5.  BFD top level hierarchy

   At the "bfd" node under control-plane-protocol, there is no
   configuration data, only operational state data.  The operational
   state data consist of overall BFD session statistics, i.e. for BFD on
   all types of forwarding paths.

2.6.  BFD IP single-hop hierarchy

   hop session is under this "ip-sh" node.

2.9.  BFD over MPLS LSPs hierarchy

   An "mpls" node is added under the "bfd" node in control-plane-
   protocol.  The configuration is per MPLS FEC under this "mpls" node.
   In the operational state model we support multiple BFD sessions per
   MPLS FEC (ECMP), the local discriminator is used as key.  The "mpls"
   node can be used in a network device (top-level), or mounted in an
   LNE or in a network instance.

2.11.  Interaction with other YANG modules

   Generic YANG Data Model for Connectionless OAM protocols
   [I-D.ietf-lime-yang-connectionless-oam] describes how the LIME
   connectionless OAM model could be extended to support BFD.

   Also, the operation of the BFD data model depends on configuration
   parameters that are defined in other YANG modules.

2.11.1.  Module ietf-interfaces

   The following boolean configuration is defined in A YANG Data Model
   for Interface Management [RFC8343]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/if:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD packets can
           be transmitted or received on that interface.

2.11.2.  Module ietf-ip

   The following boolean configuration is defined in A YANG Data Model
   for IP Management [RFC8344]:

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv4 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv4/ip:forwarding
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv4 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv6 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

   /if:interfaces/if:interface/ip:ipv6/ip:forwarding
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD IPv6 packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

2.11.3.  Module ietf-mpls

   The following boolean configuration is defined in A YANG Data Model
   for MPLS Base [I-D.ietf-mpls-base-yang]:

   /rt:routing/mpls:mpls/mpls:interface/mpls:config/mpls:enabled
           If this configuration is set to "false", no BFD MPLS packets
           can be transmitted or received on that interface.

2.11.4.  Module ietf-te

   The following configuration is defined in the "ietf-te" YANG module
   YANG Data Model for TE Topology [I-D.ietf-teas-yang-te]:

   /ietf-te:te/ietf-te:tunnels/ietf-te:tunnel/ietf-te:config/ietf-
   te:admin-status
           If this configuration is not set to "state-up", no BFD MPLS
           packets can be transmitted or received on that tunnel.

4.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management protocols such
   as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer
   is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC5246].

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC6536] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a
   preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in this YANG module that are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the

   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., edit-config)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative
   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/ip-sh/
   sessions: the list specifies the IP single-hop BFD sessions.

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/ip-sh/
   sessions: data nodes local-multiplier, desired-min-tx-interval,
   required-min-rx-interval and min-interval all impact the BFD IP
   single-hop session.  The source-addr and dest-addr data nodes can be
   used to send BFD packets to unwitting recipients, [RFC5880] describes
   how BFD mitigates against such threats.  Authentication data nodes
   key-chain and meticulous impact the security of the BFD IP single-hop
   session.

   /routing/control-plane-protocols/control-plane-protocol/bfd/ip-mh/

   The YANG module has writeable data nodes which can be used for
   creation of BFD sessions and modification of BFD session parameters.
   The system should "police" creation of BFD sessions to prevent new
   sessions from causing existing BFD sessions to fail.  For BFD session
   modification, the BFD protocol has mechanisms in place which allow
   for in service modification.

   When BFD clients are used to modify BFD configuration (as described
   in Section 2.1), the BFD clients need to be included in an analysis
   of the security properties of the BFD-using system (e.g., when
   considering the authentication and authorization of control actions).
   In many cases, BFD is not the most vulnerable portion of such a
   composite system, since BFD is limited to generating well-defined
   traffic at a fixed rate on a given path; in the case of an IGP as BFD
   client, attacking the IGP could cause more broad-scale disruption
   than (de)configuring a BFD session could cause.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or

5.1.  IANA-Maintained iana-bfd-types module

   This document defines the initial version of the IANA-maintained
   iana-bfd-types YANG module.

   The iana-bfd-types YANG module mirrors the "BFD Diagnostic Codes"
   registry and "BFD Authentication Types" registry at
   https://www.iana.org/assignments/bfd-parameters/bfd-parameters.xhtml.
   Whenever that registry changes, IANA must update the iana-bfd-types
   YANG module.

Appendix A.  Echo function configuration example

   As mentioned in Section 2.1.2, the mechanism to start and stop the
   echo function, as defined in [RFC5880] and [RFC5881], is
   implementation specific.  In this section we provide an example of
   how the echo function can be implemented via configuration.
