1.  Introduction

   Traditionally the Time To Live (TTL) of a DNS resource record has
   been understood to represent the maximum number of seconds that a
   record can be used before it must be discarded, based on its
   description and usage in [RFC1035] and clarifications in [RFC2181].
   Specifically, [RFC1035] Section 3.2.1 says that it "specifies the
   time interval that the resource record may be cached before the
   source of the information should again be consulted".

   Notably, the original DNS specification does not say that data past
   its expiration cannot be used.  This document proposes a method for
   how recursive resolvers should handle stale DNS data to balance the
   competing needs of resiliency and freshness.  It is predicated on the
   observation that authoritative server unavailability can cause
   outages even when the underlying data those servers would return is
   typically unchanged.

   There are a number of reasons why an authoritative server may become
   unreachable, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, network
   issues, and so on.  This document suggests that, if the recursive

   server is unable to contact the authoritative server but still has
   data for the query name, it essentially extends the TTL of the
   existing data on the assumption that "stale bread is better than no
   bread".

   Several major recursive resolver operations currently use stale data
   for answers in some way, including Akamai, OpenDNS, and Xerocole.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   For a comprehensive treatment of DNS terms, please see [RFC7719].

3.  Description

   Three notable timers drive considerations for the use of stale data,
   as follows:

   o  A client response timer, which is the maximum amount of time a
      recursive resolver should allow between the receipt of a
      resolution request and sending its response.

   o  A query resolution timer, which caps the total amount of time a
      recursive resolver spends processing the query.

   o  A maximum stale timer, which caps the amount of time that records
      will be kept past their expiration.

   Recursive resolvers already have the second timer; the first and
   third timers are new concepts for this mechanism.

   When a request is received by the recursive resolver, it SHOULD start
   the client response timer.  This timer is used to avoid client
   timeouts.  It SHOULD be configurable, with a recommended value of 1.8
   seconds.

   The resolver then checks its cache for an unexpired answer.  If it
   finds none and the Recursion Desired flag is not set in the request,
   it SHOULD immediately return the response without consulting the
   cache for expired records.

   If iterative lookups will be done, it SHOULD start the query
   resolution timer.  This timer bounds the work done by the resolver,
   and is commonly around 10 to 30 seconds. [ BIND 9 used to use a hard-
   coded constant of 30 seconds and has more recently added a

   configuration parameter that defaults to 10 seconds and is capped at
   30.  A rigorous exploration of other implementations has not yet been
   done. ]

   If the answer has not been completely determined by the time the
   client response timer has elapsed, the resolver SHOULD then check its
   cache to see whether there is expired data that would satisfy the
   request.  If so, it adds that data to the response message and SHOULD
   set the TTL of each expired record in the message to 1 second.  [
   This 1 second TTL is ripe for discussion. ] The response is then sent
   to the client while the resolver continues its attempt to refresh the
   data.

   The maximum stale timer is used for cache management and is
   independent of the query resolution process.  This timer is
   conceptually different from the maximum cache TTL that exists in many
   resolvers, the latter being a clamp on the value of TTLs as received
   from authoritative servers.  The maximum stale timer SHOULD be
   configurable, and defines the length of time after a record expires
   that it SHOULD be retained in the cache.  The suggested value is 7
   days, which gives time to notice the resolution problem and for human
   intervention for fixing it.

   This same basic technique MAY be used to handle stale data associated
   with delegations.  If authoritative server addresses are not able to
   be refreshed, resolution can possibly still be successful if the
   authoritative servers themselves are still up.

4.  Implementation Caveats

   Answers from authoritative servers that have a DNS Response Code of
   either 0 (NOERROR) or 3 (NXDOMAIN) MUST be considered to have
   refreshed the data at the resolver.  In particular, this means that
   this method is not meant to protect against operator error at the
   authoritative server that turns a name that is intended to be valid
   into one that is non-existent, because there is no way for a resolver
   to know intent.

   Resolution is given a chance to succeed before stale data is used to
   adhere to the original intent of the design of the DNS.  This
   mechanism is only intended to add robustness to failures, and to be
   enabled all the time.  If stale data were used immediately and then a
   cache refresh attempted after the client response has been sent, the
   resolver would frequently be sending data that it would have had no
   trouble refreshing.

   It is important to continue the resolution attempt after the stale
   response has been sent, until the query resolution timeout, because



Lawrence & Kumari      Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 4]

Internet-Draft               DNS Serve Stale                  March 2017


   some pathological resolutions can take many seconds to succeed as
   they cope with unavailable servers, bad networks, and other problems.
   Stopping the resolution attempt when the response with expired data
   has been sent would mean that answers in these pathological cases
   would never be refreshed.

   Canonical Name (CNAME) records mingled in the expired cache with
   other records at the same owner name can cause surprising results.
   This was observed with an initial implementation in BIND, where a
   hostname changed from having a CNAME record to an IPv4 Address (A)
   record.  BIND does not evict CNAMEs in the cache when other types are
   received, which in normal operations is not an issue.  However, after
   both records expired and the authorities became unavailable, the
   fallback to stale answers returned the older CNAME instead of the
   newer A.

   [ This probably applies to other occluding types, so more thought
   should be given to the overall issue.  It should probably also be
   rewritten to not suggest that this only a quirk of BIND. ]

   Keeping records around after their normal expiration will of course
   cause caches to grow larger than if records were removed at their
   TTL.  Specific guidance on managing cache sizes is outside the scope
   of this document.  Some areas for consideration include whether to
   track the popularity of names in client requests versus evicting by
   maximum age, and whether to provide a feature for manually flushing
   only stale records.

5.  Implementation Status

   [RFC Editor: per RFC 6982 this section should be removed prior to
   publication.]

   The algorithm described in this draft was originally implemented as a
   patch to BIND 9.7.0.  It has been in production on Akamai's
   production network since 2011, and effectively smoothed over
   transient failures and longer outages that would have resulted in
   major incidents.  The patch has been contributed to the Internet
   Systems Consortium in anticipation that it will be incorporated to
   their main BIND distribution.

6.  Security Considerations

   The most obvious security issue is the increased likelihood of DNSSEC
   validation failures when using stale data because signatures could be
   returned outside their validity period.  This would only be an issue
   if the authoritative servers are unreachable, the only time the

   techniques in this document are used, and thus does not introduce a
   new failure in place of what would have otherwise been success.

   Additionally, bad actors have been known to use DNS caches to keep
   records alive even after their authorities have gone away.  This
   makes that easier.

7.  Privacy Considerations

   This document does not add any practical new privacy issues.

8.  NAT Considerations

   The method described here is not affected by the use of NAT devices.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document contains no actions for IANA.  This section will be
   removed during conversion into an RFC by the RFC editor.
