Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


Abstract

   A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via a public key
   and associated data.  The public key is used to verify digital
   signatures and the associated data is used to constrain the types of
   information for which the trust anchor is authoritative.  A relying
   party uses trust anchors to determine if a digitally signed object is
   valid by verifying a digital signature using the trust anchor's
   public key, and by enforcing the constraints expressed in the
   associated data for the trust anchor.  This document describes some
   of the problems associated with the lack of a standard trust anchor
   management mechanism and defines requirements for data formats and
   protocols designed to address these problems.  This document
   discusses only public keys as trust anchors; symmetric key trust
   anchors are not considered.

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


1.  Introduction

   Digital signatures are used in many applications.  For digital
   signatures to provide integrity and authentication, the public key
   used to verify the digital signature must be "trusted", i.e.,
   accepted by a relying party (RP) as appropriate for use in the given
   context.  A public key used to verify a signature must be configured
   as a trust anchor or contained in a certificate that can be
   transitively verified by a certification path terminating at a trust
   anchor.  A Trust Anchor is a public key and associated data used by a
   relying party to validate a signature on a signed object where the
   object is either:

   o  a public key certificate that begins a certification path
      terminated by a signature certificate or encryption certificate

   o  an object (other than a public key certificate) that cannot be
      validated via use of a certification path

   Trust anchors have only local significance, i.e., each RP is
   configured with a set of trust anchors, either by the RP or by an
   entity that manages TAs in the context in which the RP operates.  The
   associated data defines the scope of a trust anchor by imposing
   constraints on the signatures the trust anchor may be used to verify.
   For example, if a trust anchor is used to verify signatures on X.509
   certificates, these constraints may include a combination of name
   spaces, certificate policies, or application/usage types.

   One use of digital signatures is the verification of signatures on
   firmware packages loaded into hardware modules, such as cryptographic
   modules, cable boxes, routers, etc.  Since such devices are often
   managed remotely, the devices must be able to authenticate the source
   of management interactions and can use trust anchors to perform this
   authentication.  However, trust anchors require management as well.

   All applications that rely upon digital signatures rely upon some
   means of managing one or more sets of trust anchors.  These sets of
   trust anchors are referred to in this document as trust anchor
   stores.  Often, the means of managing trust anchor stores are
   application-specific and rely upon out-of-band means to establish and
   maintain trustworthiness.  An application may use multiple trust
   anchor stores and a given trust anchor store may be used by multiple
   applications.  Trust anchor stores are managed by trust anchor
   managers.

   This section provides an introduction and defines basic terminology.
   Section 2 describes problems with current trust anchor management
   methods.  Sections 3 and 4 describe requirements and security

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


   considerations for a trust anchor management solution.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in order to provide a vocabulary for
   describing requirements for trust anchor management.

   Trust Anchor:   A trust anchor represents an authoritative entity via
      a public key and associated data.  The public key is used to
      verify digital signatures and the associated data is used to
      constrain the types of information for which the trust anchor is
      authoritative.  A relying party uses trust anchors to determine if
      a digitally signed object is valid by verifying a digital
      signature using the trust anchor's public key, and by enforcing
      the constraints expressed in the associated data for the trust
      anchor.

   Trust Anchor Manager:   Trust anchor manager is a role responsible
      for managing the contents of a trust anchor store.  Throughout
      this document, trust anchor managers are assumed to be represented
      as trust anchors.

   Trust Anchor Store:   A trust anchor store is a set of one or more
      trust anchors.  A trust anchor store may be managed by one or more
      trust anchor managers.  A device may have more than one trust
      anchor store.

2.  Problem Statement

   Trust anchors are used to support many application scenarios.  Most
   Internet browsers and email clients use trust anchors when
   authenticating TLS sessions, verifying signed email and generating
   encrypted email by validating a certification path to a server's
   certificate, an e-mail originator's certificate or an e-mail
   recipient's certificate.  Many software distributions are digitally
   signed to enable authentication of the software source to be
   performed prior to installation.  Trust anchors that support these
   applications are typically installed as part of the operating system
   (OS) or application, installed using an enterprise configuration
   management system or installed directly by an OS or application user.

   Trust anchors are typically stored in application-specific or
   operating system-specific trust anchor stores.  Often, a single
   machine may have a number of different trust anchor stores that may
   not be synchronized.  Reviewing the contents of a particular trust
   anchor store typically involves use of a proprietary tool that
   interacts with a particular type of trust store.

   The presence of a trust anchor in a particular store often conveys
   implicit authorization to validate signatures for any contexts from
   which the store is accessed.  For example, the public key of a
   timestamp authority (TSA) may be installed in a trust anchor store to
   validate signatures on timestamps.  However, if the store containing
   this TA is used by multiple applications that serve different
   purposes, the same key may be used (inappropriately) to validate
   other types of objects such as certificates or OCSP responses.  There
   is currently no standard means of limiting the applicability (scope)
   of a trust anchor except by placing different TAs in different stores
   and limiting the set of applications that access a given TA store.

   Trust relationships between PKIs are negotiated by policy
   authorities.  Negotiations frequently require significant time to
   ensure all participating parties' requirements are satisfied.  These
   requirements are expressed, to some extent, in public key
   certificates via policy constraints, name constraints and etc.  In
   order for these requirements to be enforced, trust anchor stores must
   be managed in accord with policy authority intentions and avoid
   circumventing constraints defined in a cross-certificate by
   recognizing the subject of the cross certificate as a trust anchor.

   Trust anchors are often represented as self-signed certificates,
   which provide no useful means of establishing the validity of the
   information contained in the certificate.  Confidence in the
   integrity of a trust anchor is typically established through out-of-
   band means, often by checking the "fingerprint" (one-way hash) of the

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


   self-signed certificate with an authoritative source.  Routine trust
   anchor re-key operations typically require similar out-of-band
   checks.  Ideally, only the initial set of trust anchors installed in
   a particular trust anchor store should require out-of-band
   verification, particularly when the costs of performing out-of-band
   checks commensurate with the security requirements of applications
   using the trust anchor store are high.

   Despite the prevalent use of trust anchors, there is neither a
   standard means for discovering which trust anchors installed in a
   particular trust anchor store nor a standard means of managing those
   trust anchors.  The remainder of this document describes requirements
   for a solution to this problem along with some security
   considerations.

3.  Requirements

   This section describes the requirements for a trust anchor management
   protocol.  Requirements are provided for trust anchor contents as
   well as for trust anchor store management operations.

3.1.  Transport independence

3.1.1.  Functional Requirements

   A general-purpose solution for the management of trust anchors must
   be transport independent in order to apply to a range of device
   communications environments.  It should be applicable in both
   session-oriented and store-and-forward contexts.  Message integrity
   must be assured in all cases.

3.1.2.  Rationale

   Not all devices that use trust anchors are available for online
   management operations; some devices may require manual interaction
   for trust anchor management.  Message integrity is required to
   authenticate the originator of a TA management transaction and
   confirm the authorization of the originator for that transaction.

3.2.  Basic management operations

3.2.1.  Functional Requirements

   At a minimum, a protocol used for trust anchor management must enable
   a trust anchor manager to perform the following operations:

   o  Determine which trust anchors are installed in a particular trust
      anchor store

   o  Add one or more trust anchors to a trust anchor store

   o  Remove one or more trust anchors from a trust anchor store

   o  Replace an entire trust anchor store

   A trust anchor management protocol must provide support for these
   basic operations, however, not all implementations must support each
   option.  For example, some implementations may only support
   replacement of trust anchor stores.

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


3.2.2.  Rationale

   These requirements describe the core operations required to manage
   the contents of a trust anchor store.  An edit operation was omitted
   for sake of simplicity, with consecutive remove and add operations
   used for this purpose.  Add and remove operations are compound to
   avoid unnecessary round trips and are provided to avoid always
   replacing an entire trust anchor store.  Trust anchor store
   replacement may be useful as a simple, higher bandwidth alternative
   to add and remove operations.  Many devices and some applications
   utilize multiple trust anchor stores.  Trust anchor store discovery
   is required to determine which trust anchor stores are present in a
   particular context.

3.3.  Management targets

3.3.1.  Functional Requirements

   A protocol for TA management must allow a TA management transaction
   to be directed to:

      All TA stores for which the manager is responsible

      An enumerated list of one or more groups of trust anchor stores

      An individual trust anchor store

3.3.2.  Rationale

   Trust anchor configurations may be uniform across an enterprise, or
   they may be unique to a single application or small set of
   applications.

   Connections between PKIs can be accomplished using different means.
   Unilateral or bilateral cross-certification can be performed, or a
   community may simply elect to explicitly accept a trust anchor from
   another community.  Typically, these decisions occur at the
   enterprise level.  In some scenarios, it can be useful to establish
   these connections for a small community within an enterprise.
   Enterprise-wide mechanisms such as cross-certificates are ill-suited
   for this purpose since certificate revocation or expiration affects
   the entire enterprise.  A trust anchor management protocol can
   address this issue by supporting limited installation of trust
   anchors and by supporting expression of constraints on trust anchor
   usage.  Limited installation requires the ability to identify the
   members of the community that are authorized to rely upon a
   particular trust anchor, as well as the ability to query and report
   on the contents of trust anchor stores.  The trust anchor constraints

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


   can represent the limitations that would have been expressed in a
   cross-certificate and limited installation ensures the recognition of
   the trust anchor does not necessarily encompass an entire enterprise.

3.4.  Delegation of TA Management Authority

3.4.1.  Functional Requirements

   A trust anchor management protocol must enable secure transfer of
   control of a trust anchor store from one trust anchor manager to
   another.  It must also enable delegation for specific operations
   without requiring delegation of the overall trust anchor management
   capability itself.

3.4.2.  Rationale

   Trust anchor re-key is one type of transfer that must be supported.
   In this case, the new key will be assigned the same privileges as the
   old key.  Creation of trust anchors for specific purposes, such as
   firmware signing, is another example of delegation.  For example, a
   trust anchor manager may delegate only the authority to sign firmware
   and disallow further delegation of the privilege, or the trust anchor
   manager may allow its delegate to delegate firmware signing to other
   entities.

3.5.  RFC 5280 Support

3.5.1.  Functional Requirements

   A trust anchor management protocol must enable management of trust
   anchors that can be used to validate certification paths in
   accordance with [RFC5280] and [RFC5055].  A trust anchor format must
   enable the representation of constraints that influence certification
   path validation or otherwise establish the scope of usage of the
   trust anchor public key.  Examples of such constraints are name
   constraints, certificate policies and key usage.

3.5.2.  Rationale

   Certification path validation is one of the most common applications
   of trust anchors.  The rules for using trust anchors for path
   validation are established in [RFC5280].  [RFC5055] describes the use
   of trust anchors for delegated path validation.

3.6.  Support Purposes Other Than Certification Path Validation

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


3.6.1.  Functional Requirements

   A trust anchor management protocol must enable management of trust
   anchors that can be used for purposes other than certification path
   validation, including trust anchors that cannot be used for
   certification path validation.  It should be possible to authorize a
   trust anchor to delegate authority (to other TAs or certificate
   holders) and to prevent a trust anchor from delegating authority.

3.6.2.  Rationale

   Trust anchors are used to validate a variety of objects other than
   public key certificates and CRLs.  For example, a trust anchor may be
   used to verify firmware packages [RFC4108], OCSP responses [RFC2560],
   SCVP responses [RFC5055] or timestamps [RFC3161].  TAs authorized for
   these operations may not be authorized to sign public key
   certificates or CRLs.

3.7.  Trust Anchor Format

3.7.1.  Functional Requirements

   Minimally, a trust anchor management protocol must support management
   of trust anchors represented as self-signed certificates or as a
   distinguished name and public key information.  The definition of a
   trust anchor must include a public key, a public key algorithm and,
   if necessary, public key parameters.  When the public key is used to
   validate certification paths, a distinguished name also must be
   included per [RFC3852].  A trust anchor format should enable
   specification of public key identifier to enable other applications
   of the trust anchor, for example, verification of data signed using
   the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) SignedData structure
   [RFC3852].  A trust anchor format should also enable the use of
   constraints that can be applied to specify the type/usage of a trust
   anchor.

3.7.2.  Rationale

   There is no standardized format for trust anchors.  Self-signed X.509
   certificates are typically used but [RFC5280] does not mandate a
   particular trust anchor representation.  It requires only that a
   trust anchor's public key information and distinguished name be
   available during certification path validation.  CMS is widely used
   to protect a variety of types of content using digital signatures,
   including contents that may verified directly using a trust anchor,
   such as firmware packages [RFC4108].

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


3.8.  Authentication of Trust Anchor Store Contents

3.8.1.  Functional Requirements

   A trust anchor manager must be able to authenticate which trust
   anchor store produced a report listing the contents of the trust
   anchor store and be able to confirm the contents of the report have
   not been subsequently altered.  Replay of old reports (from the same
   trust anchor store) must be detectable by a TA manager.

3.8.2.  Rationale

   Authentication of trust anchor store-generated reports is required to
   support remote management operations.

3.9.  Source Authentication

3.9.1.  Functional Requirements

   An entity receiving trust anchor management data must be able to
   authenticate the party providing the information and must be able to
   confirm the party is authorized to provide that trust anchor
   information.

3.9.2.  Rationale

   A trust anchor manager may be authorized to participate in trust
   anchor management protocol exchanges, but be limited to managing
   trust anchors within a particular scope.  Alternatively, a trust
   anchor manager may be authorized to participate in trust anchor
   management protocol exchanges without any constraints on the types of
   trust anchors that may be managed.

3.10.  Reduce Reliance on Out-of-Band Trust Mechanisms

3.10.1.  Functional Requirements

   A trust anchor management protocol should enable TA integrity to be
   checked automatically without relying on out-of-band trust
   mechanisms.

3.10.2.  Rationale

   Traditionally, a trust anchor is distributed out-of-band with its
   integrity checked manually prior to installation.  Installation
   typically is performed by anyone with sufficient administrative
   privilege on the system receiving the trust anchor.  Reliance on out-
   of-band trust mechanisms is one problem with current trust anchor

Internet-Draft           Trust Anchor Management               June 2008


   management approaches and reduction of the need to use out-of-band
   trust mechanisms is a primary motivation for developing a trust
   anchor management protocol.  Ideally, out-of-band trust mechanisms
   will be required only during trust anchor store initialization.

3.11.  Replay Detection

3.11.1.  Functional Requirements

   A trust anchor management protocol must enable participants engaged
   in a trust anchor management protocol exchange to detect replay
   attacks.  Replay detection mechanisms should not introduce a
   requirement for a reliable source of time as some devices that
   utilize trust anchors have no access to a reliable source of time.

3.11.2.  Rationale

   Replay of old trust anchor management messages could result in the
   addition of compromised trust anchors to a trust anchor store,
   potentially exposing applications to malicious signed objects or
   certification paths.

3.12.  Compromise or Disaster Recovery

3.12.1.  Functional Requirements

   A trust anchor management protocol must enable recovery from the
   compromise or loss of a trust anchor private key, including the
   private key authorized to serve as a source of trust anchor
   information.

3.12.2.  Rationale

   Compromise or loss of a private key corresponding to a trust anchor
   can have significant negative consequences.  Currently, in some
   cases, re-initialization of all effected trust anchor stores is
   required to recover from a lost or compromised trust anchor key.  A
   trust anchor management protocol should support recovery options that
   do not require trust anchor store re-initialization.

4.  Security Considerations

   The public key used to authenticate a TA management transaction may
   have been placed in the client as the result of an earlier TA
   management transaction or during an initial bootstrap configuration
   operation.  In most scenarios, at least one public key authorized for
   trust anchor management must be placed in each trust anchor store to
   be managed during the initial configuration of the trust anchor
   store.  This public key may be transported and checked using out-of-
   band means.  In all scenarios, regardless of the authentication
   mechanism, at least one trust anchor manager must be established for
   each trust anchor store during the initial configuration of the trust
   anchor store.

   Many of the security considerations from [RFC5280] are also
   applicable to trust anchor management.
