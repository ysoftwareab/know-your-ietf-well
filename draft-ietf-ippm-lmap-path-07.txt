Abstract

   This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of
   Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) and measurement points for
   commonly used performance metrics.  Other similar measurement
   projects may also be able to use the extensions described here for
   measurement point location.  The purpose is to create an efficient
   way to describe the location of the measurement point(s) used to
   conduct a particular measurement.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a reference path for Large-scale Measurement of
   Broadband Access Performance (LMAP) or similar measurement projects.
   The series of IP Performance Metrics (IPPM) RFCs have developed terms
   that are generally useful for path description (section 5 of
   [RFC2330]).  There are a limited number of additional terms needing
   definition here, and they will be defined in this memo.

Internet-Draft             LMAP Reference Path              October 2014


   The reference path (See section 3.1 and Figure 1 of [Y.1541],
   including the accompanying discussion) is usually needed when
   attempting to communicate precisely about the components that
   comprise the path, often in terms of their number (hops) and
   geographic location.  This memo takes the path definition further, by
   establishing a set of measurement points along the path and ascribing
   a unique designation to each point.  This topic has been previously
   developed in section 5.1 of [RFC3432], and as part of the updated
   framework for composition and aggregation, section 4 of [RFC5835].
   Section 4.1 of [RFC5835] defines the term "measurement point".

   Measurement points and the paths they inhabit are often described in
   general terms, like "end-to-end", "user-to-user", or "access".  These
   terms alone are insufficient for scientific method: What is an end?
   Where is a user located?  Is the home network included?

   As an illustrative example, consider a measurement agent in an LMAP
   system.  When it reports its measurement results, rather than
   detailing its IP address and that of its measurement peer, it may
   prefer to describe the measured path segment abstractly (perhaps for
   privacy reasons).  For instance "from a measurement agent at a home
   gateway to a measurement peer at a DSLAM".  This memo provides the
   definition for such abstract 'measurement points' and therefore the
   portion of 'reference path' between them.

   The motivation for this memo is to provide an unambiguous framework
   to describe measurement coverage, or scope of the reference path.
   This is an essential part of the meta-data to describe measurement
   results.  Measurements conducted over different path scopes are not a
   valid basis for performance comparisons.  We note that additional
   measurement context information may be necessary to support a valid
   comparison of results.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Purpose and Scope

   The scope of this memo is to define a reference path for LMAP
   activities with sufficient level of detail to determine the location
   of different measurement points along a path without ambiguity.
   These conventions are likely to be useful in other measurement
   projects as well, and in describing the applicable measurement scope
   for some metrics.

   The connection between the reference path and specific network
   technologies (with differing underlying architectures) is within the
   scope of this method, and examples are provided.  Both wired and
   wireless technologies are in-scope.

   The purpose is to create an efficient way to describe the location of
   the measurement point(s) used to conduct a particular measurement so
   that the measurement result will adequately described in terms of
   scope or coverage.  This should serve many measurement uses,
   including:

   diagnostic:  where the same metric would be measured on different
      sub-paths bounded by measurement points (see Section 4.10
      of[RFC5835]), for example to isolate the sub-path contributing the
      majority of impairment levels observed on a path.

   comparison:  where the same metric may be measured on equivalent
      portions of different network infrastructures, for example to
      compare the performance of wired and wireless home network
      technologies.

3.  Terms and Definitions

   This section defines key terms and concepts for the purposes of this
   memo.

3.1.  Reference Path

   A reference path is a serial combination of hosts, routers, switches,
   links, radios, and processing elements that comprise all the network
   elements traversed by each packet in a flow between the source and
   destination hosts.  A reference path also indicates the various
   boundaries present, such as administrative boundaries.  A reference
   path is intended to be equally applicable to all IP and link-layer
   networking technologies.  Therefore, the components are generically
   defined but their functions should have a clear counterpart or be
   obviously omitted in any network architecture.

3.2.  Subscriber

   An entity (associated with one or more users) that is engaged in a
   subscription with a service provider.  The subscriber is allowed to
   subscribe and un-subscribe to services, and to register a user or a
   list of users authorized to enjoy these services.  [Q1741] Both the
   subscriber and service provider are allowed to set the limits
   relative to the use that associated users make of subscribed
   services.

Internet-Draft             LMAP Reference Path              October 2014


3.3.  Dedicated Component (Links or Nodes)

   All resources of a Dedicated Component (typically a link or node on
   the Reference Path) are allocated to serving the traffic of an
   individual Subscriber.  Resources include transmission time-slots,
   queue space, processing for encapsulation and address/port
   translation, and others.  A Dedicated Component can affect the
   performance of the Reference Path, or the performance of any sub-path
   where the component is involved.

3.4.  Shared Component (Links or Nodes)

   A component on the Reference Path is designated a Shared Component
   when the traffic associated with multiple Subscribers is served by
   common resources.

3.5.  Resource Transition Point

   A point between Dedicated and Shared Components on a Reference Path
   that may be a point of significance, and is identified as a
   transition between two types of resources.

3.6.  Service Demarcation Point

   This is the point where service managed by the service provider
   begins (or ends), and varies by technology.  For example, this point
   is usually defined as the Ethernet interface on a residential gateway
   or modem where the scope of a packet transfer service begins and
   ends.  In the case of a WiFi Service, this would be an Air Interface
   within the intended service boundary (e.g., walls of the coffee
   shop).  The Demarcation Point may be within an integrated endpoint
   using an Air Interface (e.g., Long-Term Evolution User Equipment, LTE
   UE).  Ownership does not necessarily affect the demarcation point; a
   Subscriber may own all equipment on their premises, but it is likely
   that the service provider will certify such equipment for connection
   to their network, or a third-party will certify standards compliance.

3.7.  Managed and Un-Managed Sub-paths

   Service providers are responsible for the portion of the path they
   manage.  However, most paths involve a sub-path which is beyond the
   management of the subscriber's service provider.  This means that
   private networks, wireless networks using unlicensed frequencies, and
   the networks of other service are designated as Un-managed sub-paths.
   The Service Demarcation Point always divides Managed and Un-managed
   sub-paths.

4.  Reference Path

   This section defines a reference path for Internet communication.

Subsc. -- Private -- Private -- Service-- Intra IP -- GRA -- Transit ...
device     Net #1     Net #2    Demarc.    Access     GW     GRA GW


... Transit -- GRA -- Service -- Private -- Private -- Destination
    GRA GW     GW     Demarc.    Net #n     Net #n+1   Host


               GRA = Globally Routable Address, GW = Gateway

   The following are descriptions of reference path components that may
   not be clear from their name alone.

   o  Subsc.  (Subscriber) device - This is a host that normally
      originates and terminates communications conducted over the IP
      packet transfer service.

   o  Private Net #x - This is a network of devices owned and operated
      by the Internet Service Subscriber.  In some configurations, one
      or more private networks and the device that provides the Service
      Demarcation point are collapsed in a single device (and ownership
      may shift to the service provider), and this should be noted as
      part of the path description.

   o  Intra IP Access - This is the first point in the access
      architecture beyond the Service Demarc. where a globally routable
      IP address is exposed and used for routing.  In architectures that
      use tunneling, this point may be equivalent to the Globally
      Routable Address Gateway (GRA GW).  This point could also collapse
      to the device providing the Service Demarc., in principle.  Only
      one Intra IP Access point is shown, but they can be identified in
      any access network.

   o  GRA GW - the point of interconnection between a Service Provider's
      administrative domain and the rest of the Internet, where routing
      will depend on the GRAs in the IP header.

   o  Transit GRA GW - If one or more networks intervene between the
      Service Provider's access networks of the Subscriber and of the
      Destination Host, then such networks are designated "transit" and
      are bounded by two Transit GRA GW.

   Use of multiple IP address families in the measurement path must be
   noted, as the conversions between IPv4 and IPv6 certainly influence
   the visibility of a GRA for each family.

   In the case that a private address space is used throughout an access
   architecture, then the Intra IP Access points must use the same
   address space as the Service Demarcation point, and the Intra IP
   Access points must be selected such that a test between these points
   produces a useful assessment of access performance (e.g., includes
   both shared and dedicated access link infrastructure).

5.  Measurement Points

   A key aspect of measurement points, beyond the definition in section
   4.1 of [RFC5835], is that the innermost IP header and higher layer
   information must be accessible through some means.  This is essential
   to measure IP metrics.  There may be tunnels and/or other layers
   which encapsulate the innermost IP header, even adding another IP
   header of their own.

   In general, measurement points cannot always be located exactly where
   desired.  However, the definition in [RFC5835] and the discussion in
   section 5.1 of [RFC3432] indicate that allowances can be made: for
   example, it is nearly ideal when there are deterministic errors that
   can be quantified between desired and actual measurement point.

   The Figure below illustrates the assignment of measurement points to
   selected components of the reference path.

Subsc. -- Private -- Private -- Service-- Intra IP -- GRA -- Transit ...
device     Net #1     Net #2    Demarc.    Access     GW     GRA GW
mp000                            mp100      mp150    mp190    mp200


... Transit -- GRA -- Service -- Private -- Private -- Destination
    GRA GW     GW     Demarc.    Net #n     Net #n+1   Host
    mpX90     mp890   mp800                            mp900


               GRA = Globally Routable Address, GW = Gateway

                                 Figure 1

   Each measurement point on a specific reference path MUST be assigned
   a unique number.  To facilitate interpretation of the results, the
   measuring organisation (and whoever it shares results with) MUST have
   an unambiguous understanding of what path or point was measured.  In
   order to achieve this, a set of numbering recommendations follow.



Bagnulo, et al.          Expires April 10, 2015                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft             LMAP Reference Path              October 2014


   When communicating the results of measurements, the measuring
   organization SHOULD supply a diagram similar to Figure 1 (with the
   technology-specific information in examples that follow), and MUST
   supply it when additional measurement point numbers have been defined
   and used, with sufficient detail to identify measurement locations in
   the path.

   Ideally, the consumer of measurement results would know the location
   of a measurement point on the reference path from the measurement
   point number alone, and the recommendations below provide a way to
   accomplish this goal.  Although the initial numbering may be fully
   compliant with this system, network growth, consolidation, and re-
   arrangement, or circumstances such as ownership changes, could cause
   gaps in network numbers or non-monotonic measurement point number
   assignments along the path over time.  These are examples of
   reasonable causes for numbering deviations which must be identified
   on the reference path diagram, as required above.

   Whilst the numbering of a measurement point is in the context of a
   particular path, for simplicity the measuring organisation SHOULD use
   the same numbering for a device (playing the same role) on all the
   measurement paths through it.  Similarly, whilst the measurement
   point numbering is in the context of a particular measuring
   organisation, organizations with similar technologies and
   architectures are encouraged to coordinate on local numbering and
   diagrams.

   The measurement point numbering system, mpXnn, has two independent
   parts:

   1.  The X in mpXnn indicates the network number.  The network with
       the Subscriber's device is network 0.  The network of a different
       organization (administrative or ownership domains) SHOULD be
       assigned a different number.  Each successive network number
       SHOULD be one greater than the previous network's number.  Two
       circumstances make it necessary to designate X=9 in the
       Destination Host's network and X=8 for the Service Provider
       network at the Destination:

       A.  The number of Transit networks is unknown.

       B.  The number of Transit networks varies over time.

   2.  The nn in mpXnn indicates the measurement point and is locally-
       assigned by network X.  The following conventions are suggested:

Internet-Draft             LMAP Reference Path              October 2014


       A.  00 SHOULD be used for a measurement point at the Subscriber's
           device and at the Service Demarcation point or GW nearest to
           the Subscriber's device for Transit Networks.

       B.  90 SHOULD be used for a measurement point at the GW of a
           network (opposite from the Subscriber's device or Service
           Demarc.).

       C.  In most networks, measurement point numbers SHOULD
           monotonically increase from the point nearest the
           Subscriber's device to the opposite network boundary on the
           path (see below).

       D.  When a Destination host is part of the path, 00 SHOULD be
           used for a measurement point at the Destination host and at
           the Destination's Service Demarcation point.  Measurement
           point numbers SHOULD monotonically increase from the point
           nearest the Destination's host to the opposite network
           boundary on the path ONLY in these networks.  This
           directional numbering reversal allows consistent 00
           designation for end hosts and Service Demarcs.

       E.  50 MAY be used for an intermediate measurement point of
           significance, such as a Network Address Translator (NAT).

       F.  20 MAY be used for a traffic aggregation point such as a
           DSLAM within a network.

       G.  Any other measurement points SHOULD be assigned unused
           integers between 01 and 99.  The assignment SHOULD be stable
           for at least the duration of a particular measurement study,
           and SHOULD avoid numbers that have been assigned to other
           locations within network X (unless the assignment is
           considered sufficiently stale).  Sub-networks or domains
           within a network are useful locations for measurement points.

   When supplying a diagram of the reference path and measurement
   points, the operator of the measurement system MUST indicate: the
   reference path, the numbers (mpXnn) of the measurement points, and
   the technology-specific definition of any measurement point other
   than X00 and X90 with sufficient detail to clearly define its
   location (similar to the technology-specific examples in Section 6 of
   this document).

   If the number of intermediate networks (between the source and
   destination) is not known or is unstable, then this SHOULD be
   indicated on the diagram and results from measurement points within
   those networks need to be treated with caution.

   Notes:

   o  The terminology "on-net" and "off-net" is sometimes used when
      referring to the Subscriber's Internet Service Provider (ISP)
      measurement coverage.  With respect to the reference path, tests
      between mp100 and mp190 are "on-net".

   o  Widely deployed broadband Internet access measurements have used
      pass-through devices[SK] (at the subscriber's location) directly
      connected to the service demarcation point: this would be located
      at mp100.

   o  The networking technology must be indicated for the measurement
      points used, especially the interface standard and configured
      speed (because the measurement connectivity itself can be a
      limiting factor for the results).

   o  If it can be shown that a link connecting to a measurement point
      has reliably deterministic performance or negligible impairments,
      then the remote end of the connecting link is an equivalent point
      for some methods of measurement (although those methods should
      describe this possibility in detail; it is not in-scope to provide
      such methods here).  In any case, the presence of a link and
      claimed equivalent measurement point must be reported.

   o  Some access network architectures may have an additional traffic
      aggregation device between mp100 and mp150.  Use of a measurement
      point at this location would require a local number and diagram.

   o  A Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) deployed in the Service Provider's
      access network would be positioned between mp100 and mp190, and
      the egress side of the CGN may be designated mp150. mp150 is
      generally an intermediate measurement point in the same address
      space as mp190.

   o  In the case that private address space is used in an access
      architecture, then mp100 may need to use the same address space as
      its "on-net" measurement point counterpart, so that a test between
      these points produces a useful assessment of network performance.
      Tests between mp000 and mp100 could use a different private
      address space, and when the globally-routable side of a CGN is at
      mp150, then the private address side of the CGN could be
      designated mp149 for tests with mp100.

   o  Measurement points at Transit GRA GWs are numbered mpX00 and
      mpX90, where X is the lowest positive integer not already used in
      the path.  The GW of the first transit network is shown, with
      point mp200 and the last transit network GW with mpX90.

6.  Translation Between Reference Path and Various Technologies

   This section and those that follow are intended to provide example
   mappings between particular network technologies and the reference
   path.

   We provide an example for 3G Cellular access below.

   Subscriber -- Private ---  Service ------------- GRA --- Transit ...
   device         Net #1      Demarc.                GW     GRA GW
   mp000                       mp100                mp190    mp200

   |_____________UE______________|___RAN+Core____|___GGSN__|
   |_____Un-managed sub-path_____|____Managed sub-path_____|


    GRA = Globally Routable Address, GW = Gateway, UE = User Equipment,
       RAN = Radio Access Network, GGSN = Gateway GPRS Support Node.

   We next provide an example of DSL access.  Consider the case where:

   o  The Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) has a NAT device that is
      configured with a public IP address.

   o  The CPE is a home router that has also an incorporated a WiFi
      access point and this is the only networking device in the home
      network, all endpoints attach directly to the CPE though the WiFi
      access.

   We believe this is a fairly common configuration in some parts of the
   world and fairly simple as well.

   This case would map into the defined reference measurement points as
   follows:

Subsc. -- Private -- Private -- Service-- Intra IP -- GRA -- Transit ...
device     Net #1     Net #2    Demarc.    Access     GW     GRA GW
mp000                            mp100      mp150    mp190    mp200
|--UE--|------------CPE/NAT--------|------|-BRAS-|------|
                                   |------DSL Network---|
|_______Un-managed sub-path________|__Managed sub-path__|

      GRA = Globally Routable Address, GW = Gateway, BRAS = Broadband
                           Remote Access Server

   Consider next another access network case where:

Internet-Draft             LMAP Reference Path              October 2014


   o  The Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) is a NAT device that is
      configured with a private IP address.

   o  There is a Carrier Grade NAT (CGN) located deep in the Access ISP
      network.

   o  The CPE is a home router that has also an incorporated a WiFi
      access point and this is the only networking device in the home
      network, all endpoints attach directly to the CPE though the WiFi
      access.

   We believe this is becoming a fairly common configuration in some
   parts of the world.

   This case would map into the defined reference measurement points as
   follows:

Subsc. -- Private ------------- Service-- Intra IP -- GRA -- Transit ...
device     Net #1               Demarc.    Access     GW     GRA GW
mp000                            mp100      mp150    mp190    mp200
|--UE--|------------CPE/NAT--------|------|-CGN-|------|
                                   |--Access Network---|
|_______Un-managed sub-path________|_Managed sub-path__|

               GRA = Globally Routable Address, GW = Gateway

7.  Example Resource Transition

   This section gives an example of Shared and Dedicated portions with
   the reference path.  This example shows two Resource Transition
   Points.

   Consider the case where:

   o  The CPE consists of a wired Residential GW and modem (Private
      Net#2) connected to a WiFi access point (Private Net#1).  The
      Subscriber device (UE) attaches to the CPE though the WiFi access.

   o  The WiFi subnetwork (Private Net#1) shares unlicensed radio
      channel resources with other WiFi access networks (and potentially
      other sources of interference), thus this is a Shared portion of
      the path.

   o  The wired subnetwork (Private Net#2) and a portion of the Service
      Provider's Network are Dedicated Resources (for a single
      Subscriber), thus there is a Resource Transition Point between
      (Private Net#1) and (Private Net#2).

Internet-Draft             LMAP Reference Path              October 2014


   o  Subscriber traffic shares common resources with other subscribers
      upon reaching the Carrier Grade NAT (CGN), thus there is a
      Resource Transition Point and further network components are
      designated as Shared Resources.

   We believe this is a fairly common configuration in parts of the
   world.

   This case would map into the defined reference measurement points as
   follows:

Subsc. -- Private -- Private -- Access -- Intra IP -- GRA -- Transit ...
device     Net #1     Net #2    Demarc.    Access     GW     GRA GW
mp000                            mp100      mp150    mp190    mp200
|--UE--|------------CPE/NAT--------|------|-CGN-|------|
       |   WiFi   |  1000Base-T    |--Access Network---|

       |-Shared--|RT|------Dedicated------| RT  |-----Shared------...
|_______Un-managed sub-path________|_Managed sub-path__|


       GRA = Globally Routable Address, GW = Gateway, RT = Resource
                             Transition Point

8.  Security considerations

   Specification of a Reference Path and identification of measurement
   points on the path represent agreements among interested parties, and
   they present no threat to the implementors of this memo, or to the
   Internet resulting from implementation of the guidelines provided
   here.

   Attacks at end hosts or identified measurement points are possible.
   However, there is no requirement to include IP addresses of hosts or
   other network devices in a reference path with measurement points
   that is compliant with this memo.  As a result, the path diagrams
   with measurement point designation numbers do not aid such attacks.

   Most network operators' diagrams of reference paths will bear a close
   resemblance to similar diagrams in relevant standards or other
   publicly available documents.  However, when an operator must include
   atypical network details in their diagram, e.g., to explain why a
   longer latency measurement is expected, then the diagram reveals some
   topological details and should be marked as confidential and shared
   with others under a specific agreement.

   When considering privacy of those involved in measurement or those
   whose traffic is measured, there may be sensitive information

   communicated to recipients of the network diagrams illustrating paths
   and measurement points described above.  We refer the reader to the
   privacy considerations described in the Large Scale Measurement of
   Broadband Performance (LMAP) Framework [I-D.ietf-lmap-framework],
   which covers active and passive measurement techniques and supporting
   material on measurement context.  For example, the value of sensitive
   information can be further diluted by summarising measurement results
   over many individuals or areas served by the provider.  There is an
   opportunity enabled by forming anonymity sets described in [RFC6973]
   based on the reference path and measurement points in this memo.  For
   example, all measurements from the Subscriber device can be
   identified as "mp000", instead of using the IP address or other
   device information.  The same anonymisation applies to the Internet
   Service Provider, where their Internet gateway would be referred to
   as "mp190".

9.  IANA Considerations

   This memo makes no requests for IANA consideration.
