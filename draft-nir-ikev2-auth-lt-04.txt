Abstract

This document extends the IKEv2 document [IKEv2]. With some IPsec
peers, particularly in the remote access scenario, it is desirable to
repeat the mutual authentication periodically. The purpose of this is
to limit the time that SAs can be used by a third party who has gained
control of the IPsec peer. This document describes a mechanism
to perform this function.

1. Introduction

In several cases, such as the remote access scenario, policy dictates
that the mututal authentication needs to be repeated periodically.
Repeated authentication can usually be achieved by simply repeating
the Initial exchange by whichever side has a stricter policy.
However, in the remote access scenario it is usually up to a human
user to supply the authentication credentials, and often EAP is used
for authentication, which makes it unreasonable or impossible for the 
remote access gateway to initiate the exchange.
This document describes a new notification that the original Responder
can send to the original Initiator with the number of seconds before
the authentication needs to be repeated.  The Initiator SHOULD repeat
the Initial exchange before that time is expired.  If the Initiator 
fails to do so, the Responder may close all Security Associations.

INTERNET-DRAFT      Repeated Authentication in IKEv2      November 2005

Repeated authentication is not the same as IKE SA rekeying, and need
not be tied to it.The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as 
described in [RFC2119].

2. Authentication Lifetime

The Responder in an IKEv2 negotiation MAY be configured to limit the 
time that an IKE SA and the associated IPsec SAs may be used before
the peer is required to repeat the authentication, through a new 
Initial Exchange.

The Responder MUST send this information to the Initiator in an 
AUTH_LIFETIME notification either in the last message of an IKE_AUTH
exchange, or in a separate Informational exchange, which can be sent
at any time.
 
When sent as part of the IKE SA setup, the AUTH_LIFETIME notification
is used as follows:

     Initiator                            Responder
     -------------------------------      -----------------------------
     HDR, SAi1, KEi, Ni              -->
                                     <--  HDR, SAr1, KEr, Nr, [CERTREQ]
     HDR, SK {IDi, [CERT,] [CERTREQ,] 
        [IDr,] AUTH, SAi2, TSi, TSr} -->
                                     <--  HDR, SK {IDr, [CERT,] AUTH,
                                                   SAr2, TSi, TSr,
                                                    N(AUTH_LIFETIME)}

The separate Informational exchange is formed as follows:

                                     <--  HDR, SK {N(AUTH_LIFETIME)}
       HDR                           -->

The AUTH_LIFETIME notification is described in section 3.

The original Responder that sends the AUTH_LIFETIME notification SHOULD
send a DELETE notification soon after the end of the lifetime period,
unless the IKE SA is deleted before the lifetime period elapses. If 
the IKE SA is rekeyed, then the time limit applies to the new SA.

An Initiator that received an AUTH_LIFETIME notification SHOULD repeat
the Initial exchange within the time indicated in the notification. The
time is measured from the time that the original Initiator receives the
notification. 

A special case is where the notification is sent in an Informational
exchange, and the lifetime is zero. In that case the original responder 
SHOULD allow a reasonable time for the repeated authentication to occur.

The AUTH_LIFETIME notification MUST be protected and MAY be
sent by the original Responder at any time. If the policy changes, the 
original Responder MAY send it again in a new Informational.

The new Initial exchange is not altered. It is recommended that an
INITIAL-CONTACT notification be included in the AUTH exchange.

3. AUTH_LEFETIME Notification

The AUTH_LIFETIME message is a notification payload formatted as follows:

                           1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      ! Next Payload  !C!  RESERVED   !         Payload Length        !
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      !  Protocol ID  !   SPI Size    !      Notify Message Type      !
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      !                           Lifetime                            !
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   o  Payload Length is 12.
   o  Protocol ID (1 octet) MUST be 0.
   o  SPI size is 0 (SPI is in message header).
   o  Notify Message type is TBA by IANA
   o  Lifetime is the amount of time in seconds left before the peer
      should repeat the Initial exchange. A zero value signifies
      that the Initial exchange should begin immediately.
      It is usually not reasonable to set this value to less than 300
      (5 minutes) since that is too cumbersome for a user.
      It is also usually not reasonable to set this value to more than
      86400 (1 day) as that would negate the security benefit of 
      repeating the authentication.

4. Interoperability with non-supporting IKEv2 implementations

IKEv2 implementations that do not support the AUTH_LIFETIME
notification will ignore it and will not repeat the authentication. In
that case the original Responder will send a Delete notification for 
the IKE SA in an Informational exchange.  Such implementations may
be configured manually to repeat the authentication periodically.

Non-supporting Responders are not a problem, because they will simply
not send these notifications.  In that case, there is no requirement
that the original Initiator re-authenticate.

5. Security Considerations

The AUTH_LIFETIME notification sent by the Responder does not override
any security policy on the Initiator.  In particular, the Initiator may 
have a different policy regarding re-authentication, requiring more 
frequent re-authentication.  Such an Initiator can repeat the
authentication earlier then is required by the notification.

An Initiator MAY set reasonable limits on the amount of time in the 
AUTH_LIFETIME notification. For example, an authentication lifetime of
less than 300 seconds from SA initiation may be considered unreasonable.

IANA is asked to assign a notification payload type for the
AUTH_LIFETIME notifications from the IKEv2 Notification Payload Types
registry.
