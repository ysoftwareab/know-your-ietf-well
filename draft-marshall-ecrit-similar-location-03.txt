A LoST extension to support return of complete and similar location info
                draft-marshall-ecrit-similar-location-03

Abstract

   This document introduces a new way to provide returned location
   information in LoST responses that is either of a completed or
   similar form to the original input civic location, based on whether a
   valid or invalid location is returned within the findServiceResponse
   message.  This document defines a new extension to the
   findServiceResponse message within the LoST protocol [RFC5222] that
   enables the LoST protocol to return a completed civic location
   element set for a valid response, and one or more suggested sets of
   civic location information for invalid LoST responses.  These two
   types of civic addresses are referred to as either "complete" or
   "similar" locations, and are included as compilation of ca type xml
   elements within the existing response message structure.

1.  Introduction

   The LoST protcol [RFC5222] supports the validation of civic location
   information as input, by providing a set of validation result status
   indicators.  The current usefullness of the supported xml elements,
   "valid", "invalid", and "unchecked", is limited, because while they
   each provide an indication of validity for any one element as a part
   of the whole address, the mechanism is insufficient in providing
   either the complete set of address elements that the LoST server
   contains, or of providing alternate suggestions (hints) as to which
   civic address is intended.

   Whether the input civic location is valid and missing information, or
   invalid due to missing or wrong information during input, this
   document provides a mechanism to return a complete set of location
   information for those valid or invalid cases.

   This enhancement to the validation feature within LoST is required in
   order to ensure a high level of address matching, to overcome user

   and system input errors, and to support the usefulness of location-
   based systems in general.

   The structure of this document includes terminology, Section 2,
   followed by a discussion of the basic elements involved in location
   validation.  These use of these elements, by way of example, is
   discussed in an overview section, Section 3, with accompanying
   rationale, and a brief discussion of the impacts to LoST, and its
   current schema.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119],
   with the important qualification that, unless otherwise stated, these
   terms apply to the design of the Location Configuration Protocol and
   the Location Dereferencing Protocol, not its implementation or
   application.

   The following terms are defined in this document:

   Address:  The term Address is used interchangeably with the concept
      of Civic Location.

   Invalid:  The result of the attempt to match an individual input data
      as part of a larger set of data that has already been successfully
      matched.

   Invalid Civic Element:  An unmatched result of an individual civic
      location element as part of a broader set of elements that make up
      a civic location.

   Invalid Civic Location:  An unmatched result of an input civic
      location, when taken as a whole, based on one or more individual
      unmatched civic address elements.

   Complete Location:  An expanded civic location that includes
      additional address elements in addition to the existing validated
      civic elements provided.

   Similar Location:  A suggested civic location that is comparatively
      close to the civic location which was input, but which had one or
      more invalid element.

   Returned Location Information:  A set of standard civic location
      elements returned in a LoST response.

3.  Overview of Returned Location Information

   This document describes an extension to LoST [RFC5222], to allow
   additional location information to be returned in a
   findServiceResponse for two different use cases.

   When a LoST server is asked to validate a location, its goal is to
   take the set of elements in the location information in the request,
   and find a unique location in its database that matches the
   information in the request.  Uniqueness may not require values for
   all possible elements in the civic address that the database may
   hold.  Further, the input location information may not represent the
   form of location the users of the LoST service prefer to have.  As an
   example, there are LoST elements that could be used to define a
   postal location, suitable for delivery mail as well as a municipal
   location suitable for responding to an emergency call.  While the
   LoST server may be able to determine the location from the postal
   elements provided, the emergency services would prefer that the
   municipal location be used for any subsequent emergency call.  Since
   validation is often performed well in advance of an emergency call,
   if the LoST server could return the preferred form of location (or
   more properly, the municipal elements in addition to the postal
   elements), those elements could be stored in a LIS and used in a
   subsequent emergence call.

   Since a LoST server often contains more data than what is included
   within a findService request, it is expected that this additional
   location information could be returned within response messages that
   may be both valid and invalid.  For valid responses, where a LoST
   server contains additional location information relating to that
   civic address, the findServiceResponse message can return additional
   location information along with the original validated elements in
   order to form a complete civic location.

   On the other hand, for an invalid LoST response that contains address
   elements returned with one or more of them marked as invalid, and
   constituting an invalid location, this document introduces the idea
   of reusing this same mechanism, but for a different purpose - to
   supply similar location information - again, information that is
   contained within the LoST server, but is provided as a complete
   "similar" civic location put forward as a suggested alternative
   address that is also a valid location.

   In valid location responses, when a LoST server returns a response to
   a findService request that contains a set of CAtype elements
   considered valid, the location information in the findServiceResponse
   is extended to include additional location information specific for
   that location.  As an example, the query may contain a HNO (house



Marshall, et al.         Expires August 18, 2014                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST     February 2014


   number), RD (road name) and A3 (city) but may not contain A1, A2, PC
   (Postal Code) CAtypes.  The RD and PC elements may be sufficient to
   locate the address specified in the request and thus be considered
   valid.  Yet, downstream entities may find it helpful to have the
   additional A1, A2, and PC location elements that exist, and so the
   mechanism described here supports their inclusion.  Since [RFC5222]
   currently does not have a way for this additional location
   information to be returned in the findServiceResponse, this document
   extends RFC5222 so that it can include a completeLocation element
   within the findServiceResponse message, representing a "complete"
   civic location.

   input address: 6000 15th Ave NW Seattle

   completed address: 6000 15th Ave NW Seattle, WA 98105 US

   When invalid location responses are received, the same mechanism
   works as follows: when a LoST server returns a response to a
   findService request that contains a set of CAtype elements with one
   or more that are tagged as invalid, the location information in the
   findServiceResponse is extended to include additional location
   information specific for that location.  Differing results in the
   same data used in the above example, where the RD and PC elements are
   not sufficient to locate a unique address leads to an "invalid"
   result.  This is the case, despite the fact that the LoST server
   typically contains additional location elements which could have
   resulted in a uniquely identifiable location if additional data had
   been supplied in the query.  Since [RFC5222] currently does not have
   a way for this additional location information to be returned in the
   findServiceResponse, this document extends RFC5222 so that it can
   include one or more similarLocation elements within the
   findServiceResponse message representing "similar" civic locations.

   To show this, suppose that a similar address as above is inserted
   within a Lost findService request:

   input address: 6000 15th Ave Seattle, WA.

   Different from the above case, this time we make the assumption that
   the address is deemed "invalid" by the LoST server because there is
   no plain "15th Ave" in the city of Seattle with a house number that
   matches 6000.  However there are two addresses within the address
   dataset that are "similar", when all parts of the address are taken
   as a whole.  These similar addresses that could be suggested to the
   user are as follows:

   similar address #1: 6000 15th Ave NW Seattle, WA 98107

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST     February 2014


   similar address #2: 6000 15th Ave NE Seattle, WA 98105

   This document proposes to include the above similar addresses as
   civicAddress elements in the response to locationValidation.  The
   next section shows examples of the LoST request and response xml
   message fragments for the above valid and invalid scenarios,
   returning the complete or similar addresses, respectively:

4.  Returned Location Information

   The LoST server knows the data that is available internally, and can
   determine which additional elements can be provided either as part of
   a complete civic location (CCL) or a similar civic location (SCL).
   The inclusion of either CCL or SCL is not triggered by any message
   parameter, but is triggered based on whether the returned location
   information is valid or invalid.  It is not turned on or off, but is
   implementation specific.

5.  Complete Location returned for Valid response

   Based on the example input request, returned location information is
   provided in a findServiceResponse message when the original input
   address is considered valid, but is missing some additional data that
   the LoST server has.

Internet-Draft    Returned Location Extensions to LoST     February 2014


8.  Security Considerations

   Whether the input to the LoST server is valid or invalid, the LoST
   server ultimately determines what it considers to be valid.  In the
   case where the input location is valid, the requester still may not
   actually understand where that location is.  For valid location use
   cases, this extension returns more location information than the
   requester may have had which, in turn, may reveal more about the
   location.  While this may be very desirable when, for example,
   supporting an emergency call, it may not be as desirable for other
   services.  The LoST server implementation should consider the risk of
   releasing more detail verses the value in doing so.  Generally, we do
   not believe this is a significant problem as the requester must have
   enough location information to be considered valid, which in most
   cases is enough to uniquely locate the address.  Providing more
   CAtypes generally doesn't actually reveal anything more.

9.  IANA Considerations

9.1.  Relax NG Schema Registration

      URI:  urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:lost-similarLocation1

      Registrant Contact:  IETF ECRIT Working Group, Brian Rosen
         (br@brianrosen.net).

      Relax NG Schema: The Relax NG schema to be registered is contained
         in Section 7.  Its first line is

      default namespace = "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:lost-similarLocation1

      and its last line is

      }

9.2.  LoST Namespace Registration
