Abstract 
   This document describes a method to setup a Layer 2 tunnel over 
   networks based on Ethernet technology. For this purpose, the ports of 
   an Ethernet switch are configured to forward VLAN tag-labeled packets 
   incoming from a certain port to another unambiguous port by using 
   VLAN tag information. The Ethernet switches themselves are a part of 
   the Label Switching Routers (LSRs), which distribute the VLAN tags 
   using Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). To enable LDP to fulfil this 
   function, an LDP extension is proposed. The introduced method 
   simplifies the transport of Ethernet frames over wide area Ethernet 
   networks.

1. Introduction 
    
   In this document, a method is presented that automatically setups 
   Layer 2 (L2) tunnel through Ethernet switches. At the tunnel ingress 
   point the packets are labeled with VLAN tag(s), as defined in [5], 
   and the forwarding through the Ethernet switches is done according to 
   the VLAN tag value. The Ethernet switches on the other hand are 
   merely one part of the Label Switching Routers (LSRs). To setup a L2 
   tunnel, also called VLAN Label Switch Path (VLAN-LSP) in this 
   document, the VLAN tags are distributed throughout Label Switched 
   Routers (LSRs) by the Label Distribution Protocol (LDP). The main 
   purpose of this document is to propose an LDP extension in order to 
   enable LDP to establish and maintain L2 tunnels by distributing VLAN 
   tags. 
    
   Further, Section 1 describes the motivation of developing a new 
   transport method over VLAN-aware Ethernet switches and presents the 
   architecture of the network. Section 2 specifies some terms of the 
   used terminology. Sections 3, 4 and 5 describe the characteristics of 
   the LSRs as well as of the LSP management. Section 6 provides the 
   main contribution of this document - new label TLV in the LDP 
   protocol.

1.1 Motivation 
    
   The Ethernet technology is widely deployed for Local Area Networks 
   (LAN) since couple of years. Recently, due to appearance of high-
   speed, long distance and broadband Ethernet technology, Ethernet is 
   applied as well for Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN) and Wide Area 
   Networks (WAN). Further, Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN) 
   also uses the Ethernet technology. In this document, the use of 
   Ethernet for MAN/WAN/L2VPN networks is described as wide area 
   Ethernet. 
    
   There are some applications of wide area Ethernet, e.g. an access 
   network connecting user and Internet Service Provider (ISP), for 
   which L2 tunnelling should be performed. For these applications, 
   applying the standard Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) [3] leads 
   to complex protocol stacks as in case of Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) 
   or PPP over Ethernet and L2 Tunnelling Protocol (PPPoE + L2TP). 
   Trying to find simple solution for L2 tunnelling over Ethernet, we 
   propose a method that uses the VLAN tag for label switching and, 
   therefore, the use of Ethernet switches as LSRs. 
    
   VLAN networks introduced in [5] use the concept of building groups of 
   users, which are placed in different network domains, in such order 
   that the broadcast traffic is exchanged only between the members of 
   the group. If this concept is applied for the proposed method of MPLS 
   using VLAN tag switching, a group between two entities (e.g. user and 
   ISP) is formed, and thus, performing a L2 tunnelling (virtual path) 
   between them. Introducing this L2 tunnelling method for point-to-
   point connection over wide area Ethernet, the high-speed and 
   broadband network services between a user and an ISP can be achieved 
   economically. 
    
1.2 Network Architecture 
    
   The proposed method of setting up LSP over Ethernet using VLAN tag 
   switching can be realised as one network, in which the information is 
   transported in two independent planes. In this document they are 
   referred as forwarding plane and control plane. The forwarding plane 
   assures the reliable L2 switching of data packets over network and 
   uses the forwarding component of VLAN-LSR (a definition of VLAN-LSR 
   is given in Section 2). The control plane deals with the LSP setting 
   and management, as LDP is assumed for label distribution. Further a 
   network management entity, called Network Manager, calculates the 
   paths (VLAN-LSP) and it can control the network load.

                 Figure 1: Overview of a VLAN-LSR network 
    
   Forwarding plane: 
   A standard VLAN-aware Ethernet switch is used as a forwarding 
   component of the VLAN-LSR, and thus, the MAC address and the VLAN tag 
   are used for the data packet switching. However, applying the method 
   proposed in this document, the switching is determined by the VLAN 
   tag applied at the ingress node of the L2 tunnel. Therefore the VLAN 
   tag is referred as a label and the data path can be called LSP or 
   more precisely VLAN-LSP as defined in Section 2.  
    
   The control plane does the configuration of the forwarding plane 
   automatically. More detailed description of the functions and 
   characteristics in the forwarding plane is given in Section 3. 
    
   Control plane: 
   The VLAN-LSP setting and management is done in the control plane by 
   the control component of VLAN-LSR. The VLAN-LSP setting can be 
   achieved in two ways: explicit path for traffic engineering, (using 
   Constraint-based Routing LDP, CR-LDP) and hop-by-hop setting (using 
   standard LDP). The control (i.e. LDP) packets are processed by Layer 
   3 in the control component of the VLAN-LSR. Each control component of 
   VLAN-LSR has at least 1 IP address, which is used for routing the 
   control packets. 
    
   More detailed description of the procedures in the control plane is 
   given in Section 5. The label distribution technique described here 
   is referred according to [3] as downstream on demand with ordered 
   control. 
    
   Using a standard Ethernet switch as a forwarding component leads to 
   two main differences to the MPLS concept: 
   -  the label-switching is not performed using only one label but 
      using MAC address and VLAN tag; 
   -  label swapping at the LSR cannot be performed.

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-kawakami-mpls-lsp-vlan-00.txt    February 2003 
 
 
   With respect to other characteristics of the generic MPLS idea, the 
   proposed method could be observed as implementing MPLS concept over 
   Ethernet. For instance, the transmission is executed in L2, so it 
   depends on neither the network layer protocol nor the address system. 
   Further, by managing VLAN-LSP configuration aggregately, the path can 
   be configured and managed freely in order to perform traffic 
   engineering. 
    
   VLAN-LSP could find a broad application from Carriers and ISPs, the 
   networks of which are based on wide area Ethernet technology, as for 
   instance, a connection between user and ISP or a L2VPN over an 
   Ethernet access network. 
    
    
2. Definitions 
    
   A LSR is a device which implements the label switching control and 
   forwarding component described in [3]. 
    
   A VLAN-LSR is an LSR with a number of Ethernet interfaces, which 
   forwards frames between these interfaces, using labels carried in the 
   VLAN tag. The structure of the VLAN-LSR is depicted in Figure 2. 
   Control packets (e.g. LDP messages) are distributed using L3 routing, 
   which is performed by the VLAN-LSRs. 
    
   A VLAN-LSR domain is a set of VLAN-LSRs which are mutually 
   interconnected by Ethernet interfaces. 
    
   An Edge VLAN-LSR is a VLAN-LSR that connects the VLAN-LSR domain with 
   a node, which is outside of the domain.

   The control interface connects control component and forwarding 
   component. Transport of control (LDP) packets and configuration of 
   the forwarding plane are performed over this interface. The control 
   interface can consist of several logical and/or physical interfaces. 
    
   Forwarding component is a VLAN-aware Ethernet switch. Its ports can 
   be configured automatically through the control interface. Forwarding 
   component performs label switching, which is accomplished by using 
   the label value to forward packets.  
    
   Control component is a device implementing the LDP (resp. CR-LDP) 
   protocol and performing IP routing. After receiving and analysing a 
   LDP packet, the control component generates a new LDP packet and 
   configures the ports of the forwarding component through the control 
   interface. 
    
   VLAN-LSP is a path through one or more forwarding components of VLAN-
   LSRs that is followed by VLAN tag labeled packets. Since the label-
   switched path (LSP) is completely defined by the VLAN tag applied at 
   the ingress edge VLAN-LSR and no label swapping function is 
   performed, the VLAN-LSP can be treated as tunnel. When a VLAN-LSP is 
   used in this way, we refer to it as bi-directional. 
    
   Employing VLAN tag switching, the label is carried in the VID field 
   of the VLAN tag (see Section 4). Since the forwarding component 
   should distinguish between control and data packets, it is necessary 
   to introduce two types of VLAN tags: control and forwarding tag. They 
   are classified according the VID value. 
    
   Control tag is a VLAN tag, the VID value of which is in a certain 
   range configured by the network operator. The range of VID values of 
   the control tag can be configured freely, as long as there is no 
   overlap with the forwarding tag values. The control tag is used for 
   switching of control packets, i.e. routing packets or LDP packets. 
    
   Forwarding tag is a VLAN tag, the VID value of which is not in the 
   range of the control tag values. The forwarding tag is used for 
   switching the data packets over the Ethernet interface.  
    
   In addition, this document uses the terminology defined in [3]. 
    
    
3. VLAN Tag Switching (Forwarding Plane) 
    
   The task of the forwarding plane is to transport the data packets 
   along a VLAN-LSP between two Edge VLAN-LSRs. This transport is 
   achieved through VLAN tag switching in the forwarding component of 
   the VLAN-LSR. According to the functionality of the forwarding

   component, it can be classified in 2 groups: forwarding component of 
   edge VLAN-LSR and forwarding component of internal VLAN-LSR.  
    
   Comparing the method proposed in this document and the MPLS concept, 
   some differences can be highlighted. This document does not specify 
   the following cases: 
   -  point-to-multipoint and multipoint-to-point LSPs; 
   -  the LSRs use LSP merge. 
   However, some opportunities to specify the above cases exist and 
   could be a subject of future works. 
    
   Using a standard VLAN tag as label, no Time-to-Live (TTL) counter is 
   supported in the Layer 2 header. Such TTL counter is present merely 
   in the IP header, which is not manipulated by the forwarding 
   component, and therefore, "TTL-decrement" function cannot be 
   supported in the forwarding plane. An option to support "TTL-
   decrement" function could be found in Section 4. 
    
3.1 Forwarding Component of Edge VLAN-LSR 
    
   By receiving a data packet, the forwarding component of ingress edge 
   VLAN-LSR assigns this packet to a VLAN-LSP and inserts a VLAN tag 
   with VID corresponding to VLAN-LSP Identifier (LSPID) in the Ethernet 
   header as it is shown in Section 4. Then, the labeled packet is 
   switched based on the VID to a port corresponding to this VID. When 
   the labeled packet arrives at the egress edge VLAN-LSR, it is 
   switched to the corresponding port and the VLAN tag is removed before 
   the packet leaves the VLAN-LSR domain.  
    
3.2 Forwarding Component of internal VLAN-LSR 
    
   The forwarding component analyses the VID of the incoming labeled 
   data packets. Depending on the value of the VID, the packet is 
   switched to a port belonging to the LSP ID of the packet.  
    
   While the MPLS architecture permits considerable flexibility in LSR 
   implementation, a VLAN-LSR is constrained by the capabilities of the 
   pre-existing hardware and the restrictions of the VLAN tag format as 
   defined in [5]. Since the forwarding component is a VLAN-aware 
   Ethernet switch, the VID field of the labeled packet remains 
   unchanged on the whole VLAN-LSP, and therefore, the label swapping 
   function cannot be performed. 
    
    
4. Encapsulation 
    
   The procedures described in this section affect only the Edge VLAN-
   LSRs. The internal VLAN-LSRs themselves do not modify the

   The VLAN tag consists of TPID field (0x8100), which identifies the 
   VLAN tag, and TCI field, which contains the control information.  
    
   The label value is encoded into the VID field. Having a 12 bit VID 
   field, 4096 different labels are available, but since some of the 
   labels are reserved, about 4000 VLAN-LSPs could be set over the VLAN-
   LSR domain. To increase the number of connections over the VLAN-LSR 
   domain, VLAN tag stacking could be proposed, as the upper VLAN tag is 
   used for the packet switching (performing VLAN-LSP) and the lower 
   VLAN tag is used for mapping several connections over one VLAN-LPS. 
   However, the standardisation of VLAN tag stacking is not in the 
   responsibility of IETF. 
    
   Using a standard VLAN tag as label, no TTL filed is present in the 
   Layer 2 header, and therefore, "TTL-decrement" function cannot be 
   supported in the forwarding plane, i.e. along the VLAN-LSP. However, 
   such TTL counter is available in the IP header, which is not

   manipulated by the forwarding component, but using the hop count 
   option as defined in [6] and [9], the "TTL decrement" function could 
   be performed in the egress edge VLAN-LSR. 
    
   Pri field in VLAN tag identifies the user priority of the packet and 
   could be used similarly as Exp field described in [4]. 
    
    
5. Label Distribution and Maintenance (Control Plane) 
    
   In this section, primarily label allocation, distribution, and 
   maintenance procedures are described. These procedures are performed 
   by the control component of the VLAN-LSR.  
    
   In general, label distribution is done by a number of different 
   mechanisms, notably the LDP [6], CR-LDP [9], Border Gateway Protocol 
   (BGP), and RSVP-TE. In this document, it is assumed that the label 
   bindings are distributed only by LDP and/or CR-LDP. Below, certain 
   requirements on these two protocols are described. A support of VLAN 
   tag switching does NOT require from the VLAN-LSR to support the VLAN 
   control component defined by the IEEE (e.g., STP, GARPI). 
    
   This document discusses the use of "Downstream-on-demand with ordered 
   control" label distribution (see [6]) by VLAN-LSRs. These label 
   distribution procedures MUST be used in the control component of 
   VLAN-LSR. First we describe the behaviour of the control component of 
   the edge VLAN-LSR and afterwards of the internal VLAN-LSR. 
    
5.1 Control Component of Edge VLAN-LSR 
    
   A VLAN-LSP MUST be configured by the control components of all VLAN-
   LSRs along the path before starting to forward data packets. For this 
   purpose, the Network Manager (see Figure 1) calculates the VLAN-LSP 
   and the further steps for setting up the VLAN-LSP depend on the used 
   signalling protocol. If LDP is used, the Network Manager (NM) sends 
   to the ingress LSR the IP address of the egress VLAN-LSR. Afterwards 
   the VLAN-LSP can set up employing the routing tables of the VLAN-LSR 
   and knowing the IP address of the egress VLAN-LSR. On the other hand, 
   if CR-LDP is used, the NM sends a list of IP addresses to the ingress 
   edge VLAN-LSR. This list contains the IP addresses of the control 
   components of all VLAN-LSRs, which construct the path. The edge VLAN-
   LSR uses CR-LDP signalling protocol to send Label Request Message to 
   the VLAN-LSR having the next IP address in the Explicit Route TLV 
   (ER-TLV). 
    
   Once the control component of the edge VLAN-LSR receives the Label 
   Mapping Message, it configures the forwarding component. To forward 
   data packets along a VLAN-LSP, the forwarding component of ingress

   VLAN-LSR SHOULD insert a VLAN tag in the Ethernet header. There are 
   two possibilities to decide how to determine the VLAN tag: 
    
   (1) Using CR-LDP 
       The use of CR-LDP offers another two possibilities to determine 
       the VLAN tag to be inserted in the incoming data packets: 
       - The VID field of the VLAN tag is derived from LSPID TLV of the 
         CR-LDP message using its "Local CR-LSP ID" field. More 
         precisely, the "Local CR-LSP ID" field has length of 16 bit, 
         while the VID field is only 12-bit long, and therefore, only 
         first 12 bits of the "Local CR-LSP ID" field are used for 
         defining the VID field. Having this in mind, the network 
         management system (i.e. Network Manager) sets the "Local CR-
         LSP ID" field in such manner that the first 12 bits of this 
         field are a unique identifier of the VLAN-LSP connection for 
         the whole VLAN-LSR domain. 
       - The control component may use the VID field from "VLAN label 
         TLV" (defined in section 6) to determine the same named field 
         in the VLAN tag. 
       
   (2) Using LDP 
       Since the "Local CR-LSP ID" field of the LSPID TLV is not 
       available, the egress VLAN-LSR must determine the value of the 
       VID value employing another methods. Thus, in order to avoid 
       overlapping of the VID values because a number of VLAN-LSRs are 
       present in the network, each egress VLAN-LSRs should require 
       that value from the Network Manager. The Network Manager 
       distributes the VID values using the "VLAN Label TLV" proposed 
       in section 6. 
    
   To achieve the data forwarding along a certain VALN-LSP, the control 
   component configures the forwarding component (i.e. Ethernet switch) 
   as sending to it information for data packet classification, which 
   includes input port number, VID value of the VLAN tag and output port 
   number. Since the VLAN-LSP is bi-directional, the edge VLAN-LSRs of a 
   given VLAN-LSP perform the functions of both ingress and egress LSR. 
    
5.2 Control Component of Internal VLAN-LSR 
    
   When the control component of an internal VLAN-LSR receives (via LDP 
   or CR-LDP) a Label Request Message for a certain VLAN-LSP from a peer 
   connected to its VLAN-LSR, the control component takes the following 
   actions: 
    
   1. it allocates a label (VID) 
    
      There are two different cases for allocating of labels depending 
      of the employed signalling protocol:

INTERNET-DRAFT   draft-kawakami-mpls-lsp-vlan-00.txt    February 2003 
 
 
       - Employing CR-LDP, the control component has two possibilities 
         to decide how to configure the label of the forwarding 
         component. First, it may use the "Local CR-LSP ID" field of 
         LSPID TLV, included in the Label Request Message. In this case, 
         the control component SHOULD use the first 12 bits of "Local 
         CR-LSP ID" field to configure the label. Second, the control 
         component may use the VID field from "VLAN label TLV" (defined 
         in section 6) to allocate the label. 
       - Employing LDP, the control component SHOULD use the VID field 
         from in section 6 proposed "VLAN Label TLV", which is contained 
         in the Label Mapping Message. 
       
      Note: When two VLAN-LSPs are completely separated in the domain 
      (two LSPs never passes the same VLAN-LSR), as long as managing 
      with the network management function, the same label (first 12 
      bits of "Local CR-LSP ID" field) MAY be used for these two VLAN-
      LSPs. 
    
   2. it sends a Label Request Message to the downstream VLAN-LSR, which 
     has the next address in the ER-TLV 
    
   3. it returns a Label Mapping Message back to the peer that 
     originated the request. The VLAN-LSR SHOULD wait for the request 
     to be satisfied from the downstream LSR because the "ordered 
     control" is used (as defined in [3] and [6]), in particular 
     "ingress-initiated ordered control". 
    
   Whenever a VLAN-LSR originates a Label Request Message to its next 
   hop LSR as a result of receiving a Label Request Message from another 
   (upstream) LSR, and the request to the next hop LSR is not satisfied, 
   the VLAN-LSR SHOULD destroy the binding created in response to the 
   received request, and notify the requester. 
    
   When a VLAN-LSR determines that it has lost its LDP session with 
   another LSR, the following actions are taken. Any binding information 
   learned via this connection MUST be discarded. For any label bindings 
   that were created as a result of receiving Label Request Message from 
   the peer, the LSR MAY destroy these bindings (and release labels 
   associated with these binding). Further, the procedures for CR-LDP 
   defined in [9] are applied. 
    
    
6. LDP Extension with new VLAN Label TLV 
    
   In this section, a LDP extension is proposed in order to enable the 
   control components of VLAN-LSRs to communicate the necessary 
   information to setup VLAN-LSP. This LDP extension includes the

   definition of a new Label TLV, called VLAN Label TLV, which is 
   distributed by the Label Mapping Message. 
    
   Applying the VID field of VLAN tag as a label for switching in the 
   forwarding plane, the forwarding component must be correspondingly 
   configured by the control component in the VLAN-LSR. Since the 
   communication between the control components is performed by LDP (CR-
   LDP), it is REQUIRED that the VID information is encoded in the LDP 
   packets. To achieve this requirement, the VLAN Label TLV is specified 
   as follows: 
    
      0                   1                   2                   3  
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
     |U|F| VLAN Label (TBA by IANA)  |       Length                  |

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
    
   U bit 
      Should be set to 0 as well as in all other Label TLVs. 
    
   F bit 
      Should be set to 0 as well as in all other Label TLVs. 
    
   VLAN Label 
      This field indicates that the label type is the VLAN Label TLV. 
      This value is allocated by IANA. 
    
   Length 
      Specifies the length of the Value field in octets. 
    
   Reserved 
      This field is reserved. It should be set to zero on transmission 
      and ignored on receipt. 
    
   VID 
      Virtual LAN Identifier (12bit). This field is the same as the VID 
      field of VLAN tag specified in 802.11q [5]. 
    
    
7. Security Considerations 
    
   The encapsulation and procedures specified in this document do not 
   interfere in any way with the application of authentication and/or 
   encryption to network layer packets (such as the application of IPSEC 
   to IP diagrams)

   The procedures described in this document do not protect against the 
   alternation (either accidental or malicious) of the MPLS labels. Such 
   alternation could cause misforwarding. 
    
   The procedures described in this document do not enable a receiving 
   VLAN-LSR to authenticate the transmitting VLAN-LSR.  
    
   A discussion on the security considerations applicable to the label 
   distribution mechanism can be found in [6].
