Abstract 

  The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) utilizes the offer/answer 
  model to establish and update multimedia sessions using the Session 
  Description Protocol (SDP). The description of the offer/answer 
  model in SIP is dispersed across multiple RFCs. This document 
  summarizes all the current usages of the offer/answer model in SIP 
  communication.

1. Introduction 

  SIP utilizes the offer/answer model to establish and update the 
  session. The rules to govern the offer/answer behaviors in SIP are 
  described in the several RFCs. 

  The primary purpose of this document is to describe all forms of 
  SIP usage of the offer/answer model in one document to help the 
  readers to fully understand it. Also, this document tries to 
  incorporate the results of the discussions on the controversial 
  issues to avoid repeating the same discussions later. 

  This document is not intended to make normative changes. Rather, it 
  makes the remaining open issues clear and leaves them for further 
  study. 

1.1. Terminology 

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in 
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [1].  
  This document only uses these key words when referencing normative 
  statements in existing RFCs. 

2. Summary of SIP usage of the Offer/Answer Model 

  The offer/answer model itself is independent from the higher layer 
  application protocols which utilize it. SIP is one of the 
  applications using the offer/answer model. RFC 3264 [4] defines the 
  offer/answer model, but does not specify which SIP messages should 
  convey an offer or an answer. This should be defined in the SIP 
  core and extensions RFCs. 

  In theory, any SIP message can include a session description in its 
  body. But a session description in a SIP message is not necessarily 
  an offer or an answer. Only certain session description usages that 
  conform to the rules described in standards-track RFCs can be 
  interpreted as an offer or an answer. The rules for how to handle 
  the offer/answer model are currently defined in several RFCs. 

  The offer/answer model defines a mechanism for update of sessions. 
  In SIP, a dialog is used to associate an offer/answer exchange with 
  the session which it is to update. In other words, only the

Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  offer/answer exchange in the SIP dialog can update the session 
  which is managed by that dialog. 

2.1. Offer/Answer Exchange Pairs in SIP Messages 

  Currently, the rules on the offer/answer model are defined in RFC 
  3261 [2], RFC 3262 [3] and RFC 3311 [5]. In these RFCs, only the 
  six patterns shown in Table 1 are defined for exchanging an offer 
  and an answer with SIP messages. 

  Note that an offer/answer exchange initiated by an INVITE request 
  must follow exactly one of the patterns 1, 2, 3, 4. When an initial 
  INVITE causes multiple dialogs due to forking, an offer/answer 
  exchange is carried out independently in each distinct dialog. When 
  an INVITE request contains no offer, only pattern 2 or pattern 4 
  apply. 'The first reliable non-failure message' must have an offer 
  if there is no offer in the INVITE request. This means that UA 
  which receives the INVITE request without an offer must include an 
  offer in the first reliable response with 100rel extension. If no 
  reliable provisional response has been sent, the UAS must include 
  an offer when sending 2xx response. 

  In pattern 3, the first reliable provisional response may or may 
  not have an answer. When a reliable provisional response contains a 
  session description, and is the first to do so, then that session 
  description is the answer to the offer in the INVITE request. The 
  answer can not be updated, and a new offer can not be sent in a 
  subsequent reliable response for the same INVITE transaction. 

  In pattern 5, a PRACK request can contain an offer only if the 
  reliable response which it acknowledges contains an answer to the 
  previous offer/answer exchange. 

       NOTE: It is legal to have UPDATE/2xx exchanges without 
       offer/answer exchanges (pattern 6). However when re-INVITEs 
       are sent for non-offer/answer purposes, an offer/answer 
       exchange is required. In that case the prior SDP will 
       typically be repeated.  

  There may be ONLY ONE offer/answer negotiation in progress for a 
  single dialog at any point in time. Section 4 explains how to 
  ensure this. When an INVITE results in multiple dialogs each has a 
  separate offer/answer negotiation. 

       NOTE: This is when using a Content-Disposition of "session". 
       There may be a second offer/answer negotiation in progress

       using a Content-Disposition of "early-session" [7]. That is 
       not addressed by this draft.

  Table 1. Summary of SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model 

  In Table 1, '1xx-rel' corresponds to the reliable provisional 
  response which contains the 100rel option defined in RFC 3262 [3]. 

  The 'Ini' column shows the ability to exchange the offer/answer to 
  initiate the session. 'Y' indicates that the pattern can be used in 
  the initial offer/answer exchange, while 'N' indicates that it can 
  not. Only the initial INVITE transaction can be used to exchange 
  the offer/answer to establish a multimedia session. 

  The 'Est' column shows the ability to update the established 
  session. 

  The 'Early' column indicates which patterns may be used to modify 
  the established session in an early dialog. There are two ways to 
  exchange a subsequent offer/answer in an early dialog. 

2.2. Rejection of an Offer 

  It is not entirely clear how to reject an offer when it is 
  unacceptable, and some methods do not allow explicit rejection of 
  an offer. For each of the patterns in Table 1, Table 2 shows how to 
  reject an offer. 

  When a UA receives an INVITE request with an unacceptable offer, it 
  should respond with a 488 response, preferably with Warning header 
  field indicating the reason of the rejection, unless another 
  response code is more appropriate to reject it. (Pattern 1 and 
  Pattern 3) 

  When a UA receives an UPDATE request with an offer which it can not 
  accept, it should respond with a 488 response preferably with 
  Warning header field indicating the reason of the rejection, unless 
  another response code is more appropriate to reject it. (Pattern 6) 

 
Sawada & Kyzivat       Expires October 25, 2008               [Page 5] 
   
Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  When a UA receives a PRACK request with an offer which it can not 
  accept, it may respond with a 200 response with a syntactically 
  correct session description. This may optionally be followed by an 
  UPDATE request to rearrange the session parameters if both ends 
  support the UPDATE method. Alternatively the UA may terminate the 
  dialog and send an error response to the INVITE request. The 
  validity and consequences of a 488 response to PRACK is an open 
  issue which is discussed within a subsequent section (Section 
  6.1. ). (Pattern 5) 

  When a UA receives a response with an offer which it can not accept, 
  the UA does not have a way to reject it explicitly. Therefore, a UA 
  should respond to the offer with the correct session description 
  and rearrange the session parameters by initiating a new 
  offer/answer exchange, or alternatively terminate the session. 
  (Pattern 2 and Pattern 4) When initiating a new offer/answer, a UA 
  should take care not to cause an infinite offer/answer loop. 

     Offer                Rejection  
  -----------------------------------------------------  
  1. INVITE Req.          488 INVITE Response  
  2. 2xx INVITE Resp.     Answer in ACK Req. followed by new offer  
                          OR termination of dialog 
  3. INVITE Req.          488 INVITE Response (same as Pattern 1.)  
  4. 1xx-rel INVITE Resp. Answer in PRACK Req. followed by new offer  
  5. PRACK Req. (*)       200 PRACK Resp. followed by new offer  
                          OR termination of dialog 
  6. UPDATE Req.          488 UPDATE Response 
   
  Table 2. Rejection of an Offer 

  (*) A UA should only use PRACK to send an offer when it has strong 
  reasons to expect the receiver will accept the offer. 

2.3. Session Description which is not Offer nor Answer 

  As previously stated, a session description in a SIP message is not 
  necessarily an offer or an answer. For example, SIP can use a 
  session description to describe capabilities apart from 
  offer/answer exchange. Examples of this are 200 OK responses for 
  OPTIONS and 488 responses for INVITE.

3. Detailed Discussion of the Offer/Answer Model for SIP 

3.1. Offer/Answer for the INVITE method with 100rel extension 

  The INVITE method provides the basic procedure for offer/answer 
  exchange in SIP. Without the 100rel option, the rules are simple as 
  described in RFC 3261 [2]. If an INVITE request includes a session 
  description, pattern 1 is applied and if an INVITE request does not 
  include a session description, pattern 2 is applied. 

  With 100rel, pattern 3 and pattern 4 are added and this complicates 
  the rules. An INVITE request may cause multiple responses. Note 
  that even if both UAs support the 100rel extension, not all the 
  provisional responses may be sent reliably. Note also that a 
  reliable provisional response is allowed without a session 
  description if the UAS does not wish to send the answer yet. An 
  unreliable provisional response may include a session description 
  in the body if the UAS has not sent a reliable response, but its 
  session description is neither an offer nor an answer. All the 
  session descriptions in the unreliable responses to the INVITE 
  request must be identical to the answer which is included in the 
  reliable response. A session description in an unreliable response 
  that precedes a reliable response can be considered a "preview" of 
  the answer that will be coming, and hence may be treated like an 
  answer until the actual one arrives.  

       NOTE: This "preview" session description rule applies to a 
       single offer/answer exchange. In parallel offer/answer 
       exchanges (caused by forking) a UA may obviously receive a 
       different "preview" of an answer in each dialog. UAs are 
       expected to deal with this. 

  Although RFC 3261 says a UA should accept media once an INVITE with 
  an offer has been sent, in many cases, an answer (or, at least a 
  preview of it) is required in order for media to be accepted. 
  Therefore, a UAS should send an SDP answer reliably (if possible) 
  before it starts sending media. And, if neither the UAC nor the UAS 
  support 100rel, the UAS should send a preview of the answer before 
  it starts sending media. 

3.1.1. INVITE Request with SDP 

  When a UAC includes an SDP body in the INVITE request as an offer, 
  it expects the answer to be received with one of the reliable 
  responses. Other than that, no offer/answer exchanges can occur in 
  the messages within the INVITE transaction.

       Figure 1 Example of Offer/Answer with 100rel Extension (1) 

  For example, in Figure 1, only the SDP in F6 is the answer. The SDP 
  in the non-reliable response (F2) is the preview of the answer and 
  must be the same as the answer in F6. Receiving F2, the UAC should 
  act as if it receives the answer. However, offer/answer exchange is 
  not completed yet and the UAC must not send a new offer until it 
  receives the same SDP in the first reliable response, which is the 
  real answer. After sending the SDP in F6, the UAS must prepare to 
  receive a new offer from the UAC with an UPDATE request or a PRACK 
  request. 

  The UAS does not include SDP in responses F9 and F12. However, the 
  UAC should prepare to receive SDP bodies in F9 and/or F12, and just

  ignore them, to handle a peer that does not conform to the 
  recommended implementation. 

3.1.2. INVITE request without SDP 

  When a UAC does not include an SDP body in the INVITE request, it 
  expects the offer to be received with the first reliable response. 
  The UAC will send the answer in the request to acknowledge the 
  response, i.e. PRACK or ACK request of the reliable response. Other 
  than that, no offer/answer exchanges can occur in the messages 
  within the INVITE transaction.  

       NOTE: The UAS should not include SDP in the responses F6 and 
       F9. However, the UAC should prepare to receive SDP bodies in 
       F6 and/or F9, and just ignore them to handle a peer that does 
       not conform to the recommended implementation.

  Note that in the case that the UAC needs to prompt the user to 
  accept or reject the offer, the reliable provisional response with 
  SDP as an offer (pattern 4) can result in the retransmission until

  the PRACK request can be sent. The UAC should take care to avoid 
  this situation when it sends the INVITE request without SDP. 

3.2. Offer/Answer Exchange in Early Dialog 

  When both UAs support the 100rel extension, they can update the 
  session in the early dialog once the first offer/answer exchange 
  has been completed. 

  From a UA sending an INVITE request: 

  A UA can send an UPDATE request with a new offer if both ends 
  support the UPDATE method. Note that if the UAS needs to prompt the 
  user to accept or reject the offer, the delay can result in 
  retransmission of the UPDATE request. 

  A UA can send a PRACK request with a new offer only when 
  acknowledging the reliable provisional response carrying the answer 
  to an offer in the INVITE request. Compared to using the UPDATE 
  method, using PRACK can reduce the number of messages exchanged 
  between the UAs. However, to avoid problems or delays caused by 
  PRACK offer rejection, the UA is recommended to send a PRACK 
  request only when it has strong reasons to expect the receiver will 
  accept it. For example, the procedure used in precondition 
  extension [6] is a case where a PRACK request should be used for 
  updating the session status in an early dialog. Note also that if a 
  UAS needs to prompt the user to accept or reject the offer, the 
  delay can result in retransmission of the PRACK request.  

  From a UA receiving an INVITE request: 

  A UA can send an UPDATE request with a new offer if both ends 
  support the UPDATE method. A UAS can not send a new offer in the 
  reliable provisional response, so the UPDATE method is the only 
  method for a UAS to update an early session. 

3.3. Offer/Answer Exchange in an Established Dialog 

  Both the re-INVITE and UPDATE methods can be used in an established 
  dialog to update the session. 

  The UPDATE method is simpler and can save at least one message 
  compared with the INVITE method. But both ends must support the 
  UPDATE method for it to be used. 

  The INVITE method needs at least three messages to complete but no 
  extensions are needed. Additionally, the INVITE method allows the

Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  peer to take time to decide whether it will accept a session update 
  or not by sending provisional responses. That is, re-INVITE allows 
  the UAS to interact with the user at the peer, while UPDATE needs 
  to be answered automatically by the UAS. It is noted that re-INVITE 
  should be answered immediately unless such a user interaction is 
  needed. Otherwise, some 3pcc flows will break. 

4. Exceptional Case Handling 

  In RFC 3264 [4], the following restrictions are defined with regard 
  to sending a new offer. 

      "It MUST NOT generate a new offer if it has received an offer 
      which it has not yet answered or rejected. It MUST NOT generate 
      a new offer if it has generated a prior offer for which it has 
      not yet received an answer or a rejection." 

  Assuming that the above rules are guaranteed, there seem to be two 
  possible 'exceptional' cases to be considered in SIP offer/answer 
  usage: the 'message crossing' case, and the 'glare' case. One of 
  the reasons why the usage of SIP methods to exchange offer/answer 
  needs to be carefully restricted in the RFCs is to ensure that the 
  UA can detect and handle appropriately the 'exceptional' cases to 
  avoid incompatible behavior. 

4.1. Message Crossing Case Handling 

  When message packets crossed in the transport network, an offer may 
  be received before the answer for the previous offer/answer 
  exchange, as described in Figure 3. In such a case, UA A must 
  detect the session description of the offer2 is not the answer to 
  offer1. 

   A                  B  
   |offer1            |  
   |----------------->|  
   |           answer1|  
   |<------\  /-------|  
   |        \/        |  
   |        /\  offer2|  
   |<------/  \-------|  
   
                     Figure 3 Message Crossing Case 

  When offer2 is in an UPDATE request or a re-INVITE request, a 
  session description cannot be the expected answer. Then UA A must

Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  reject the message including offer2 with a 491 response with Retry-
  After header field. 

  When offer2 is in a PRACK request, that is, when the PRACK request 
  is acknowledging a reliable provisional response with an answer to 
  an offer in an INVITE request containing a session description, UA 
  A knows it is an offer. To avoid rejecting the PRACK or PRACK offer, 
  UA A is recommended to wait for answer1 before sending a PRACK 
  response with the answer to the offer2. Note that if UA A does not 
  send a new offer until the reliable provisional response with an 
  answer to the offer in the INVITE request is acknowledged with a 
  PRACK request, this case never happens. Fortunately, under the 
  current rules, UA A can not send a new offer until the reliable 
  response.  

  When offer2 is in a reliable provisional response or a successful 
  final response (as shown in Figure 4), UA A knows it is not the 
  answer to the offer1. For a reliable response to an initial INVITE 
  request, this case never happens. For a reliable response to a re-
  INVITE request, UA A can infer that offer2 is not the answer1. In 
  this case, since UA A can not reject offer2 in a reliable response, 
  it is recommended that it wait for answer1 before sending a PRACK 
  request with the answer to offer2. Note that this case only occurs 
  when UA A, while waiting for an answer, sends an INVITE request 
  without session description.  

  Table 3 summarizes the discussions above.

4.2. Glare Case Handling 

  When both ends in a dialog send a new offer at nearly the same time, 
  as described in Figure 5, a UA may receive a new offer before it 
  receives the answer to the offer it sent. This case is usually 
  called a 'glare' case. 

   A                  B  
   |offer1      offer2|  
   |-------\  /-------|  
   |        \/        |  
   |        /\        |  
   |<------/  \------>|  
   
                          Figure 5 Glare Case 

  When offer2 is in an UPDATE request or (re-)INVITE request, it must 
  be rejected with a 491 response. 

  When offer2 is in a PRACK request (within the current rules, only 
  possible if offer1 is in an UPDATE request), the PRACK may be 
  accepted with 200 or may be rejected with a 491 response. A 491 
  response is valid to satisfy the offer/answer model but it may 
  delay the completion of the reliable response transfer mechanism or, 
  in worst case, may result in the failure to complete the SIP 
  transaction because there is no clear retry rule when a PRACK 
  request is rejected with a 491 response. To avoid this glare 

 
Sawada & Kyzivat       Expires October 25, 2008              [Page 13] 
   
Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  condition, UA A should not send an offer if it has already sent a 
  reliable provisional response containing an answer to a previous 
  offer and has not received the corresponding PRACK request. 

  To avoid a glare condition involving an offer in a response, when 
  UA A has sent a (re)INVITE request without session description, it 
  should not send an offer until it has received an offer in a 
  reliable response to the (re)INVITE, and sent an answer to that 
  offer. 

5. Content of Offers and Answers 

  While RFCs 3264 [4] and 3312[6] give some guidance, questions remain 
  about exactly what should be included in an offer or answer. This 
  is especially a problem when the common "hold" feature has been 
  activated, and when there is the potential for a multimedia call. 

  Details of behavior depend on the capabilities and state of the 
  User Agent. The kinds of recommendations that can be made are 
  limited by the model of device capabilities and state that is 
  presumed to exist. 

  This section focuses on a few key aspects of offers and answers 
  that have been identified as troublesome, and will consider other 
  aspects to be out of scope. This section considers: 

  - choice of supported media types and formats to include and 
  exclude 

  - hold and resume of media 

  The following are out of scope for this document: 

  - NAT traversal and ICE 

  - specific codecs and their parameters 

  - the negotiation of secure media streams 

  - grouping of media streams 

  - preconditions 

5.1. General Principle for Constructing Offers and Answers 

  A UA should send an offer that indicates what it, and its user, are 
  interested in using/doing at that time, without regard for what the 

 
Sawada & Kyzivat       Expires October 25, 2008              [Page 14] 
   
Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  other party in the call may have indicated previously. This is the 
  case even when the offer is sent in response to an INVITE or re-
  INVITE that contains no offer. (However in the case of re-INVITE 
  the constraints of RFCs 3261 and 3264 must be observed.) 

  A UA should send an answer that includes as close an approximation 
  to what the UA and its user are interested in doing at that time, 
  while remaining consistent with the offer/answer rules of RFC 
  3264 [4] and other RFCs. 

       NOTE: "at that time" is important. The device may permit the 
       user to configure which supported media are to be used by 
       default. 

  In some cases a UA may not have direct knowledge of what it is 
  interested in doing at a particular time. If it is an intermediary 
  it may be able to delegate the decision. In the worst case it may 
  apply a default, such as assuming it wants to use all of its 
  capabilities. 

5.2. Choice of Media Types and Formats to Include and Exclude 

5.2.1. Sending an Initial INVITE with Offer 

  When a UAC sends an initial INVITE with an offer, it has complete 
  freedom to choose which media type(s) and media format(s) (payload 
  types in the case of RTP) it should include in the offer.  

  The media types may be all or a subset of the media the UAC is 
  capable of supporting, with the particular subset being determined 
  by the design and configuration [7] of the UAC combined with input 
  from the user interface of the UAC.  

  The media formats may be all or a subset of the media formats the 
  UAC is capable of supporting for the corresponding media type, with 
  the particular subset being determined by the design and 
  configuration [7] of the UAC combined with input from the user 
  interface of the UAC. 

  Including all supported media formats will maximize the possibility 
  that the other party will have a supported format in common. But 
  including many can result in an unacceptably large SDP body.  

5.2.2. Responding with an Offer when the Initial INVITE has no Offer 

  When a UAS has received an initial INVITE without an offer, it must 
  include an offer in the first reliable response to the INVITE. It 

 
Sawada & Kyzivat       Expires October 25, 2008              [Page 15] 
   
Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  has largely the same options as when sending an initial INVITE with 
  an offer, but there are some differences. The choice may be 
  governed by both static (default) selections of media types as well 
  as dynamic selections made by a user via interaction with the 
  device while it is alerting. 

       NOTE: The offer may be sent in a provisional response, before 
       the user of the device has been alerted and had an opportunity 
       to select media options for the call. In this case the UAS 
       cannot include any call-specific options from the user of the 
       device. If there is a possibility that the user of the device 
       will wish to change what is offered before answering the call, 
       then special care should be taken. If PRACK and UPDATE are 
       supported by caller and callee then an initial offer can be 
       sent reliably, and changed with an UPDATE if the user desires 
       a change. If PRACK and UPDATE are not supported then the 
       initial offer cannot be changed until the call is fully 
       established. In that case either the offer should be delayed 
       until the 200 is sent, or else the offer should include the 
       minimum set of media the user is able to select. 

5.2.3. Answering an Initial INVITE with Offer 

  When a UAS receives an initial INVITE with an offer, what media 
  lines the answer may contain is constrained by RFC 3264 [4]. The 
  answer must contain the same number of m-lines as the offer, and 
  they must contain the same media types. Each media line may be 
  accepted, by including a non-zero port number, or rejected by 
  including a zero port number in the answer. The media lines that 
  are accepted should typically be those that would have been offered 
  had the INVITE not contained an offer, excluding those not offered.  

  The media formats the answer may contain are constrained by RFC 
  3264 [4]. For each accepted m-line in the answer, there must be at 
  least one media format in common with the corresponding m-line of 
  the offer. The UAS may also include other media formats it is able 
  to support at this time. However there is little benefit to 
  including added types. 

  If the UAS does not wish to indicate support for any of the media 
  types in a particular media line of the offer it must reject the 
  corresponding media line, by setting the port number to zero.

5.2.4. Answering when the Initial INVITE had no Offer 

  When a UAC has sent an initial INVITE without an offer, and then 
  receives a response with the first offer, it should answer in the 
  same way as a UAS receiving an initial INVITE with an offer. 

5.2.5. Subsequent Offers and Answers 

  The guidelines above (sections 5.1. and 5.2.1. through 5.2.4. ) 
  apply, but constraints in RFC 3264 [4] must also be followed. The 
  following are of particular note because they have proven 
  troublesome: 

  o The number of m-lines may not be reduced in a subsequent offer. 
     Previously rejected media streams must remain, or be reused to 
     offer the same or a different stream. (RFC 3264 [4] section 6.) 

  o In the o-line, only the version number may change, and if it 
     changes it must increment by one from the one previously sent as 
     an offer or answer. (RFC 3264 [4] section 8.) If it doesn't 
     change then the entire SDP body must be identical to what was 
     previously sent as an offer or answer. Changing the o-line, 
     except version number value, during the session is an error case. 
     The behavior when receiving such a non-compliant offer/answer 
     SDP body is implementation dependent. If a UA needs to negotiate 
     a 'new' SDP session, it should use the INVITE/Replaces method. 

  o In the case of RTP, the mapping from a particular dynamic 
     payload type number to a particular codec within that media 
     stream (m-line) must not change for the duration of the session. 
     (RFC 3264 [4] section 8.3.2.)  

       NOTE: This may be impossible for a B2BUA to follow in some 
       cases (e.g. 3pcc transfer) if it does not terminate media.  

  When the new offer is sent in response to an offerless (re)INVITE, 
  all codecs supported by the UA are to be included, not just the 
  ones that were negotiated by previous offer/answer exchanges. The 
  same is true for media types - so if UA A initially offered audio 
  and video to UA B, and they end up with only audio, and UA B sends 
  an offerless (re)INVITE to UA A, A's resulting offer should re-
  attempt video, by reusing the zeroed m-line used previously. 

       NOTE: The behavior above is recommended, but it is not always 
       achievable - for example in some interworking scenarios. Or, 
       the offerer may simply not have enough resources to offer 
       "everything" at that point. Even if the UAS is not able to 

 
Sawada & Kyzivat       Expires October 25, 2008              [Page 17] 
   
Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

       offer any other SDP that the one currently being used, it 
       should not reject the re-INVITE. Instead, it should generate 
       an offer with the currently used SDP with o- line unchanged. 

5.3. Hold and Resume of media 

  RFC 3264 [4] specifies (non-normatively) that "hold" should be 
  indicated in an established session by sending a new offer 
  containing "a=sendonly" for each media stream to be held. An 
  answerer is then to respond with "a=recvonly" to acknowledge that 
  the hold request has been understood. 

  Note that the use of sendonly/recvonly is not limited to hold. 
  These may be used for other reasons, such as devices that are only 
  capable of sending or receiving. So receiving an offer with 
  "a=sendonly" must not be treated as a certain indication that the 
  offerer has placed the media stream on hold. 

  This model is based on an assumption that the UA initiating the 
  hold will want to play Music on Hold, which is not always the case. 
  A UA may, if desired, initiate hold by offering "a=inactive" if it 
  does not intend to transmit any media while in hold status. 

  The rules of RFC 3264 [4] constrain what may be in an answer when 
  the offer contains "sendonly", "recvonly", or "inactive" in an a= 
  line. But they do not constrain what must be in a subsequent offer. 
  The General Principle for Constructing Offers and Answers (section 
  5.1. ) is important here. The initiation of "hold" is a local 
  action. It should reflect the desired state of the UA. It then 
  affects what the UA includes in offers and answers until the local 
  state is reset.  

  The receipt of an offer containing "a=sendonly" or "a=inactive" and 
  the sending of a compatible answer should not change the desired 
  state of the recipient. However, a UA that has been "placed on 
  hold" may itself desire to initiate its own hold status, based on 
  local input. 

  If UA2 has previously been "placed on hold" by UA1, via receipt of 
  "a=sendonly", then it may initiate its own hold by sending a new 
  offer containing "a=sendonly" to UA1. Upon receipt of that, UA1 
  will answer with "a=inactive" because that is the only valid answer 
  that reflects its desire not to receive media.  

  Once in this state, to resume a two way exchange of media each side 
  must reset its local hold status. If UA1 is first to go off hold it 
  will then send an offer with "a=sendrecv". The UA2 will respond 

 
Sawada & Kyzivat       Expires October 25, 2008              [Page 18] 
   
Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  with its desired state of "a=sendonly" because that is a permitted 
  response. When UA2 desires to also resume, it will send an offer 
  with "a=sendrecv". In this case, because UA1 has the same desire it 
  will respond with "a=sendrecv". In the same case, when UA2 receives 
  the offer with "a=sendrecv", if it has decided it wants to reset 
  its local hold but has not yet signaled the intent, it may send 
  "a=sendrecv" in the answer. 

  If UA2 has been "placed on hold" by UA1 via receipt of "a=inactive", 
  and subsequently wants to initiate its own hold, also using 
  "a=inactive", it need not send a new offer, since the only valid 
  response is "a=inactive" and that is already in effect. However, 
  its local desired state will now be either "inactive" or 
  "a=sendonly". This affects what it will send in future offers and 
  answers. 

  If a UA has occasion to send another offer in the session, without 
  any desire to change the hold status (e.g. in response to a re-
  INVITE without an offer, or when sending a re-INVITE to refresh the 
  session timer) it should follow the General Principle for 
  Constructing Offers and Answers (section 5.1. ). If it previously 
  initiated a "hold" by sending "a=sendonly" or "a=inactive" then it 
  should offer that again. If it had not previously initiated "hold" 
  then it should offer "a=sendrecv", even if it had previously been 
  forced to answer something else. Without this behavior it is 
  possible to get "stuck on hold" in some cases, especially when a 
  third-party call controller is involved. 

5.4. Behavior on receiving SDP with c=0.0.0.0 

  RFC 3264 [4] specifies that An agent MUST be capable of receiving 
  SDP with a connection address of 0.0.0.0, in which case it means 
  that neither RTP nor RTCP should be sent to the peer. 

  If a UA generates an answer to the offer received with c=0.0.0.0, 
  the direction attribute of the accepted media stream in the answer 
  must be based on direction attribute of the offered stream and 
  rules specified in RFC 3264 to form the a-line in the answer. 
  c=0.0.0.0 has no special meaning for the direction attribute of the 
  accepted stream in the answer. 

6. Remaining Issues or Best Practices on Offer/Answer 

  This document clarifies the offer/answer usage in SIP and 
  summarizes the correct or recommended behaviors along with the 
  existing RFCs. To create any new normative behaviors beyond these 
  RFCs is not the intent of this document. 

 
Sawada & Kyzivat       Expires October 25, 2008              [Page 19] 
   
Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  However, through the scrutiny of the offer/answer model in SIP, 
  some issues are found to be unresolved within the current set of 
  RFCs. Those remaining issues are described in this section mainly 
  for further study. 

6.1. Rejecting PRACK Offer 

  As stated in section 2.2. and 3.2. , it is recommended that an 
  offer not be sent in a PRACK request unless UAC has strong reasons 
  to assume the receiver will accept it. Even so, there may be cases 
  when the UAS has to reject the offer for some reason. The current 
  RFCs do not provide a way to reject the offer and at the same time 
  to indicate that the PRACK adequately acknowledged the reliable 
  response. It is unclear whether a non-200 response can still 
  indicate an acknowledgement of the reliable response. 

  Several ideas were presented to resolve this issue, such as sending 
  2xx PRACK response without SDP to reject the offer, or sending SDP 
  with a decreased version value in the o-line. Some of the 
  candidates may also be adapted as a way to reject an unacceptable 
  offer in a response. Anyway, those proposals violate the current 
  rules and lose backward compatibility to some extent (e.g. section 
  5 of RFC 3262). It is beyond the scope of this document and remains 
  for further study. 

  The 488 response is another proposed solution; however the validity 
  and consequences of a 488 response to PRACK is an open issue. 
  Because the 488 response may be sent by a proxy, the UAC cannot 
  assume the reliable transaction has been adequately acknowledged. 
  If a 488 response is received, the UAC should ensure acknowledgment 
  of the reliable response by sending a new PRACK with the offer 
  removed or modified based upon the received 488 response. If the 
  488 response is sent by UAS (open issue), it cannot assume that the 
  UAC thinks that the reliable transaction has been adequately 
  acknowledged even though the UAS may treat otherwise (open issue). 
  If a 488 response is sent by UAS, the UAC should accommodate 
  receiving the altered PRACK with higher CSeq without expecting it 
  to trigger a 481 response (open issue). 

       NOTE: Deprecation of the usage of offer in PRACK may be 
       another solution. As the precondition mechanism specification 
       [3] explicitly shows a usage of sending offer in PRACK, its 
       deprecation could cause backward compatibility issues.

6.2. Commit/Rollback of Offer/Answer on Unsuccessful re-INVITE 
  Transaction 

  When a re-INVITE transaction fails, the dialog remains with the 
  session bound to it. The issue here is: what is the session status 
  if an offer/answer exchange has been completed (if a session 
  description has been sent in a reliable provisional response to the 
  re-INVITE request), or if subsequent offer/answer exchanges have 
  taken place (using UPDATE or PRACK transactions), before the re-
  INVITE transaction is terminated with a final error response 
  (Figure 6). One option is to take those offer/answer exchanges not 
  committed yet and to make the session status rollback to the one 
  before re-INVITE transaction was initiated. Another option is to 
  take those exchanges committed and to keep the session status as it 
  is even after re-INVITE fails. There is no clear consensus on which 
  one is the correct behavior. 

  There are some cases where it is useful to exchange 
  offer(s)/answer(s) even before re-INVITE completes. The case of 
  adding a new media (like adding video to audio only session) which 
  requires permission from the peer through some user interaction is 
  one example. Precondition procedures can be another case which may 
  require several offer/answer exchanges in one re-INVITE transaction.

  To make bad things worse, if a new offer from UAC and the final 
  response to re-INVITE are sent at nearly the same time, the UAS can 
  not know whether this new offer was sent before or after UAC 
  received the final failure response (Figure 7). Note that the ACK 
  request to the failure response is sent hop-by-hop basis, therefore 
  even after receiving the ACK request, UAS can not make sure that 
  UPDATE request was sent after the final response had been reached 
  to the other end. 

  Sending a new UPDATE request from UAC to synchronize the status 
  anytime after the re-INVITE fails may be a good option. This 
  solution, however, requires that the UPDATE method be supported by 
  both ends and needs care to avoid flapping when each end tries to 
  advertise their different views of the session status. 

  The proper handling of this issue is undefined by existing 
  standards.  Resolution is beyond the scope of this document, and 
  will require a new normative document.

6.3. Offer in a Reliable Response 

  In RFC 3261, it is stated that when an INVITE is sent without an 
  offer, the first reliable response MUST contain an offer. There was 
  discussion on whether this rule can be loosened up. There is no 
  clear explanation why this restriction is defined. However, this

Internet-Draft   SIP Usage of the Offer/Answer Model       April 2008 
   

  rule will be left as it is, unless the strong necessity to loosen 
  it up is raised in the future. 

6.4. Requesting Hold while already on Hold 

  RFC 3264, section 8.4, contains procedures for putting a unicast 
  media stream on hold. Of particular note, it states: 

    "If the stream to be placed on hold was previously a recvonly 
    media stream, it is placed on hold by marking it inactive." 

  Section 5.3. of the current document makes a recommendation for 
  this case which conflicts with that, and explains why. Some 
  concerns have been raised that such a recommendation is invalid 
  because RFC 3264 is normative on this subject. 

  This document takes the position that Section 8.4 of RFC 3264 is 
  non-normative, and so may be overridden. It is further recommended 
  that RFC 3264 be revised to avoid the confusion.  

7. Add New Offer/Answer Usage in SIP 

  This document recommends against the addition of new offer/answer 
  methods using SIP. However, it may be necessary to define new 
  offer/answer exchange methods as SIP extensions evolve. This 
  section recommends some things that should be taken into 
  considerations in that case. 

7.1. Explicit Usage 

  New method definitions should define offer/answer usage explicitly 
  without any ambiguity. 

7.2. Rejection of an Offer 

  New method definitions should define how to reject an offer where 
  possible. 

7.3. Backward Compatibility 

  New methods must keep backward compatibility. 

7.4. Exceptional Case Handling 

  New methods should take care of how to handle exceptional cases, 
  message crossing case and glare case.
