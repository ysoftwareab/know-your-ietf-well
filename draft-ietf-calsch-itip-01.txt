Abstract

   This document specifies how calendaring systems use iCalendar objects
   to interoperate with other calendar systems. It does so in a general
   way so as to allow multiple methods of communication between systems.
   Subsequent documents specify interoperable methods of communications
   between systems that use this protocol.

   The document outlines a model for calendar exchange that defines both
   static and dynamic event, to-do, journal and free/busy objects.
   Static objects are used to transmit information from one entity to
   another without the expectation of continuity or referential
   integrity with the original item. Dynamic objects are a superset of
   static objects and will gracefully degrade to their static
   counterparts for clients that only support static objects.

   Introduction

   This document specifies how calendaring systems use iCalendar objects
   to interoperate with other calendar systems. In particular, it
   specifies how to schedule events, to-dos, or daily journal entries.
   It further specifies how to search for available busy time
   information. It does so in a general way so as to allow multiple
   methods of communication between systems. Subsequent documents
   specify interoperable methods of communications between systems that
   use this protocol.

   This protocol is based on requests sent from an originator and
   conveyed to one or more recipients. A recipient of a request MAY
   reply, in order to update their status and MAY also return
   transaction/request status information. The protocol also supports
   the ability for the entry originator to modify or cancel the original
   entry. The elements of the protocol also include the notion of user
   roles.

1.1 Formatting Conventions

   In order to refer to elements of the calendaring and scheduling
   model, core object or interoperability protocol defined in [ICMS],
   [ICAL] and [ITIP] several formatting conventions have been utilized.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interopreted as described in [RFC 2119].

   Calendaring and scheduling roles defined by [ICMS] are referred to in
   quoted-strings of text with the first character of each word in upper
   case. For example, "Organizer" refers to a role of a "Calendar User"
   within the scheduling protocol defined by [ITIP] Calendar components
   defined by [ICAL] are referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of
   text. All calendar components start with the letter "V". For example,
   "VEVENT" refers to the event calendar component, "VTODO" refers to
   the to-do calendar component and "VJOURNAL" refers to the daily
   journal calendar component. Scheduling methods defined by [ITIP] are
   referred to with capitalized, quoted-strings of text. For example,
   "REQUEST" refers to the method for requesting a scheduling calendar
   component be created or modified, "REPLY" refers to the method a
   recipient of a request uses to update their status with the
   "Organizer" of the calendar component.

   Properties defined by [ICAL] are referred to with capitalized,
   quoted-strings of text, followed by the word "property". For example,
   "ATTENDEE" property refers to the iCalendar property used to convey
   the calendar address of a "Calendar User". Property parameters
   defined by this memo are referred to with lower case, quoted-strings
   of text, followed by the word "parameter". For example, "value"
   parameter refers to the iCalendar property parameter used to override
   the default data type for a property value. Enumerated values defined
   by this memo are referred to with capitalized text, either alone or
   followed by the word "value".

   In tables, the quoted-string text is specified without quotes in
   order to minimize the table length.

1.2 Related Documents

   Implementers will need to be familiar with several other memos that,
   along with this one, describe the Internet calendaring and scheduling
   standards. This document, [ITIP], specifies an interoperability
   protocol for scheduling between different implementations;

     [ICMS] - describes the abstract model and defines common terms and
     concepts;

     [ICAL] - specifies the objects, data types, properties and property
     parameters used in the protocols, along with the methods for
     representing and encoding them;

     [IRIP] - specifies an Internet real time protocol binding for
     [ITIP].

     [IMIP] specifies an Internet email binding for [ITIP].

   This memo does not attempt to repeat the specification of concepts or
   definitions from these other memos. Where possible, references are
   made to the memo that provides for the specification of these
   concepts or definitions.

1.3 Calendar Roles

   Roles are a behavior or set of activities performed by particular
   groups of users or agents at a given state of the calendar
   transaction. This specification describes 4 roles that determine a
   range of actions and responsibilities specific to each role.

+=====================================================================+
|  Role Name   |  Description                                         |
|=====================================================================|
| Owner        | The calendar entry owner is the only Calendar User   |
|              | allowed to directly modify an entry using the iTIP   |
|              | protocol. However, the Owner MAY delegate or         |
|              | assign an Organizer to manage the entry on their     |
|              | behalf. Usually, a calendar entry Owner is also the  |
|              | Organizer.                                           |
|              |                                                      |
| Organizer    | The Organizer controls manipulation of the calendar  |
|              | entry. In most cases, the Owner and the Organizer    |
|              | are the same Calendar User.                          |
|              |                                                      |
| Attendee     | An Attendee is a Calendar User associated with       |
|              | a calendar entry via a Request method issued by an   |
|              | Organizer or another Attendee. Attendees are not     |
|              | capable of directly manipulating calendar entries,   |
|              | but MUST act through the Organizer.                  |
|              |                                                      |
| Delegate     | A Delegate is a proxy that acts on behalf of another |
|              | Calendar User. ITIP addresses two forms of           |

|              | 1) An Owner MAY delegate or re-assign an Organizer   |
|              | to manage a calendar entry                           |
|              | 2) An Attendee MAY delegate a calendar entry request |
|              | to another Calendar User.                            |
+=====================================================================+


1.4 iTIP Transactions

   This protocol defines seven methods for exchanging [ICAL] objects for
   the purposes of group calendaring and scheduling between "Calendar
   Users". The methods are defined below and their usage and semantics
   are outlined in section 3 of this document.

+================+==================================================+
| Method         |  Description                                     |
|================+==================================================|
| PUBLISH        | Used to publish a calendar entry to one or more  |
|                | Calendar Users. There is no interactivity        |
|                | between the publisher and any other calendar     |
|                | user. An example might include a baseball team   |
|                | publishing its schedule to the public.           |
|                |                                                  |
| REQUEST        | Used to schedule a calendar entry with other     |
|                | Calendar Users. Requests are interactive in that |
|                | they MAY require the receiver to respond using   |
|                | the the Reply methods. Meeting Requests, Busy    |
|                | Time requests and the assignment of VTODOs to    |
|                | other Calendar Users are all examples.           |
|                | Requests are also used by the "Organizer" to     |
|                | update the status of a calendar entry.           |
| REPLY          | A Reply is used in response to a Request to      |
|                | convey "Attendee" status to the "Organizer".     |
|                | Replies are commonly used to respond to meeting  |
|                | and task requests.                               |
|                |                                                  |
| CANCEL         | The Cancel method is used to cancel an existing  |
|                | calendar entry such as a VEVENT or VTODO.        |
|                |                                                  |
| REFRESH        | The Refresh method is used by an "Attendee" to   |
|                | request the latest version of a calendar entry   |
|                |                                                  |
| COUNTER        | The Counter method is used by an "Attendee" to   |
|                | negotiate a change in the calendar entry.        |
|                | Examples include the request to change a         |
|                | proposed Event time or change the due date for a |
|                | VTODO.                                           |
| DECLINE-       |                                                  |
| COUNTER        | Used by the "Organizer" to decline the proposed  |
|                | counter-proprosal by an "Attendee"               |

2  Interoperability Models

   There are two distinct protocols relevant to interoperability: an
   "Application Protocol" and a "Transport Protocol". The Application
   Protocol defines the content of the iCalendar objects sent between
   sender and receiver to accomplish the scheduling transactions listed
   in section 1.4. The Transport Protocol defines how the iCalendar
   objects are sent between the sender and receiver. This document
   focuses on the Application Protocol.

   The connection between Sender and Receiver in the diagram below
   refers to the Application Protocol. In particular, the iCalendar
   objects passed from the Sender to the Receiver which conform to those
   presented in Section 3, Application Protocol Elements.

             +----------+                      +----------+
             |          |        iTIP          |          |
             |  Sender  |<-------------------->| Receiver |
             |          |                      |          |
             +----------+                      +----------+


   There are several variations of this diagram in which the Sender and
   Receiver take on various roles of "CUA"  or CS. These variants are
   detailed in the Model document [ICMS]

   The architecture of iTIP is depicted in the diagram below. An
   application written to this specification MAY work with bindings for
   the store-and-forward transport, the real time transport, or both.
   Also note that iTIP could be bound to other transports. If a
   capability is not available on a particular transport binding, iTIP
   provides a mechanism for indicating so.

2.1 Application Protocol

   The model for the application protocol is centered with the
   "Organizer" of the calendar entry. That is, the "Organizer" of a
   Calendar entry sends a request to one or more "Attendees". The
   "Attendees" then reply to the "Organizer". The "Organizer" maintains
   the status of the event.

   The "Owner" is usually the "Organizer" of the calendar entry.
   However, the "Owner" MAY delegate or assign an "Organizer" to manage
   the calendar entry on their behalf. In cases where the "Owner" has
   delegated to another "Organizer", the "Owner" must still be specified
   in associated "REQUEST" and "COUNTER" methods.

   The data sources for the application protocol are the "Calendar
   Users". Examples of these users are the "Organizer" and "Attendees"
   of an iCalendar event. The data objects are the iCalendar objects
   that are exchanged between "Calendar Users".

2.1.1     Calendar Entry State

   There are two distinct states relevant to calendar entries: the
   overall state of the entry and the state associated with an
   "Attendee" to that entry.

   The state of an entry is defined by the "STATUS" property and is
   controlled by the "Organizer." There is no default value for the
   "STATUS" property. The "Organizer" MAY either set the "STATUS"
   property to TENTATIVE or CONFIRMED values. The "Organizer" MAY also
   set the "STATUS" property to CANCELLED value by sending a "CANCEL"
   method to each "Attendee".

   The state of a particular "Attendee" relative to an entry is defined
   by the "STATUS" property parameter in the "ATTENDEE" property for
   that "Attendee". When an "Organizer" sends out an entry, the state
   associated with each "Attendee" is NEEDS-ACTION. Each "Attendee" MAY
   modify their "ATTENDEE" property "STATUS" parameter to an appropriate
   value and send it back to the "Organizer" in a "REPLY" message.

3 Application Protocol Elements

   Messages are "text/calendar" MIME entities that contain calendaring
   and scheduling information. The particular type of [ICAL] message is
   referred to as the "method type". Each method type is identified by a
   "METHOD" property specified as part of the "text/calendar" content
   type. The table below shows various combinations of calendar
   components and the method types that this memo supports.

          +=================================================+
          |         | VEVENT | VTODO | VJOURNAL | VFREEBUSY |
          |=================================================|

          |Counter  |  Yes   |  Yes  |  No      |   No      |
          +=================================================+


   Each method type is defined in terms of its associated properties.
   Some properties are required, some are optional and others are
   excluded. The property restrictions are expressed in this memo using
   the following formal notation:

3.1 Methods For "VEVENT" Calendar Component

   This section defines the property set restrictions for the method
   types that are applicable to the "VEVENT" calendar component. Each of
   the methods is defined using a grammar that clarifies the property
   constraints that define the particular method.

   The following summarizes the methods that are defined for the
   "VEVENT" calendar component.

3.1.1     PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component provides an
   unsolicited posting of an iCalendar object. Any "Calendar User" MAY
   add the published components to their calendar. It requires and
   accepts no responses to the "Organizer". Its expected usage is for
   encapsulating an arbitrary event or to-do as an iCalendar object. The
   "Organizer" MAY subsequently update (with another "PUBLISH" method)
   or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a previously published "VEVENT"
   calendar component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Event - Publish" COMPONENT "VEVENT" METHOD "PUBLISH

     MUST COMPONENT = CALPROPS (
          MUST PROPERTY = PRODID, VERSION{"2.0"}, METHOD{"PUBLISH"})

     )

3.1.2     REQUEST

   The "REQUEST" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component provides the
   following scheduling functions:

       Invite "Attendees" to an event;

       Reschedule an existing event;

       Update the details of an existing event, without rescheduling
        it;

       Update the status of "Attendees" of an existing event, without
        rescheduling it;

       Reconfirm an existing event, without rescheduling it;

       For an existing "VEVENT" calendar component, delegate the role
        of "Attendee" to another "Calendar User";

       For an existing "VEVENT" calendar component, delegate the role
        of "Organizer" to another "Calendar User".

   The originator of the "REQUEST" method is the "Organizer" of the
   event. Normally this is the "Owner" of the event. The recipient of
   the "REQUEST" method is the "Calendar User" invited to the event,
   called the "Attendee". The "Attendee" uses the "REPLY" method to
   convey their attendance status to the "Organizer" of a VEVENT
   "REQUEST".

   The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" properties are used to distinguish the
   various uses of the "REQUEST" method. If the "UID" property value in
   the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the
   "REQUEST" is for a new "VEVENT" calendar component. If the "UID"
   property value is found on the recipient's calendar, then the
   "REQUEST"' is for either a rescheduling, an update, or a reconfirm of
   the "VEVENT" calendar component.

   If the "Organizer" of the "REQUEST" method is not authorized to make
   an event request on the "Attendee's" calendar system, then an
   exception is returned in the "REQUEST-STATUS" property of a
   subsequent "REPLY" method, but no scheduling action is performed.

     )


3.1.2.1   REQUEST for Rescheduling an Event

   The "REQUEST" method MAY be used to reschedule an event.

   A rescheduled event involves a change to the existing event in terms
   of it's time or recurrence intervals and possibly the location or
   description. If the recipient "CUA" of a "REQUEST" method finds that
   the "UID" property value already exists on the calendar, but that the
   "SEQUENCE" property value in the "REQUEST" method is greater than the
   value for the existing event, then the "REQUEST" method describes a
   rescheduling of the event.

3.1.2.2   REQUEST for Update or Reconfirmation of an Event

   The "REQUEST" method MAY be used to update or reconfirm an event.

   An update to an existing event does not involve changes to the time
   or recurrence intervals, and might not involve a change to the
   location or description for the event. If the recipient "CUA" of a
   "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID" property value already exists


Silverberg/Mansour/Dawson/Hopson  14                   Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft                   iTIP                  October 24, 1997


   on the calendar and that the "SEQUENCE" property value in the
   "REQUEST" is the same as the value for the existing event, then the
   "REQUEST" method describes an update of the event details, but no
   rescheduling of the event.

   The update "REQUEST" method is the appropriate response to a
   "REFRESH" method sent from an "Attendee" to the "Organizer" of an
   event.

   Unsolicited "REQUEST" methods MAY also be sent by the "Organizer" of
   an event. The unsolicited "REQUEST" methods MAY be used to either
   update the details of the event, without rescheduling it, to update
   the "STATUS" property parameter of "Attendees", or to reconfirm the
   event.

3.1.2.3   REQUEST for Delegating an Event from an "Attendee" to another
      CU

   The "REQUEST" method MAY be used to delegate an event to another
   "Calendar User". The method is used to delegate the "Attendee's" role
   (i.e., "Organizer" or "Attendee") for an event. The "REQUEST" method
   for delegation is sent by one of the "Attendees" of an existing event
   request to some other "Calendar User". In order to avoid scheduling
   loops, the method MUST NOT be sent from an "Attendee" back to the
   "Organizer" of the event. An "Attendee" MAY NOT delegate to the
   "Organizer" of the event.

   For the purposes of this description, the "Attendee" delegating the
   event is referred to as the "delegator". The "Attendee" receiving the
   delegation request is referred to as the "delegatee".

   The "delegator" of an event MUST forward the existing "REQUEST"
   method for an event to the "delegatee". The event description MUST
   include the "delegator's" up-to-date event definition. The "REQUEST"
   method MUST also include an "ATTENDEE" property with the calendar
   address of the "delegatee". The "delegator" MUST also send a "REPLY"
   method back to the "Organizer" with the "delegator's" "Attendee"
   property "STATUS" parameter value set to DELEGATED. In addition, the
   "DELEGATED-TO" parameter SHOULD be included with the calendar address
   of the "delegatee". A response to the delegation "REQUEST" is sent
   from the "delegatee" to the "Organizer" and optionally, to the
   "delegator". The "REPLY" method from the "delegatee" SHOULD include
   their "ATTENDEE" property with the "DELEGATED-FROM" parameter value
   of the "delegator's"calendar address.

   The delegation "REQUEST" method MUST assign the values of the "RSVP"
   and "EXPECT" property parameters associated with the "delegator's"
   "ATTENDEE" property to that of the "delegatee's" "ATTENDEE" property.
   For example if the "delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property specifies
   "RSVP=TRUE;EXPECT=REQUEST", then the "delegatee's" "ATTENDEE"
   property MUST specify "RSVP=TRUE;EXPECT=REQUEST".

3.1.2.4   REQUEST for Delegating role of "Organizer" to another CU

   If the "Owner" of an existing "VEVENT" calendar component wishes to
   delegate the role of "Organizer" to another CU, they MAY issue



Silverberg/Mansour/Dawson/Hopson  15                   Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft                   iTIP                  October 24, 1997


   another "REQUEST" method that notifies all "Attendees" and the new
   "Organizer" of this change. The "Owner MUST modify several property
   parameters of the "ATTENDEE" property including the "ROLE", where the
   role of "Owner" and "Organizer" MUST be specified. Additionally, the
   "DELEGATED-TO" and "DELEGATED-FROM" parameters MUST specify the
   "Organizer" and "Owner" calendar addresses. The "Owner" MAY request
   reconfirmation by incrementing the "SEQUENCE" property and setting
   the "RSVP" property parameter to TRUE. This will cause a
   reconfirmation to be sent to the new organizer.

3.1.2.5   REQUEST for Changing the "Organizer" from one CU to another

   An "Owner" of an existing "VEVENT" calendar component MAY change the
   "Organizer" from one "CU" to another by sending a "REQUEST" method.
   The "ROLE" property parameter value of ORGANIZER MUST be assigned to
   the new "Organizer". If the old "Organizer" is still an "Attendee"
   then "ROLE" property parameter for that "CU" MUST be set to ATTENDEE.

3.1.2.6   REQUEST for Changing the "Owner"

   This memo does not support the notion of changing ownership of a
   "VEVENT" calendar component.

3.1.2.7   REQUEST Forwarded To An Uninvited Calendar User

   An "Attendee" invited to an event MAY invite another uninvited
   "Calendar User" to the event. The invited "Attendee" accomplishes
   this scheduling action by forwarding the original "REQUEST" method to
   the uninvited "Calendar User". The forwarded "REQUEST" method need
   not include a new "ATTENDEE" property for the uninvited "Attendee".
   Whether the uninvited "Calendar User" is added to the attendee list,
   and thus informed of changes to the "VEVENT" calendar component is an
   implementation issue.

3.1.2.8   REQUEST Updated Attendee Status

   An "Organizer" of an event MAY also request an updated status from
   one of the "Attendees". This is achieved by the "Organizer" sending a
   "REQUEST" method to the "Attendee" with the "ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE"
   property sequence. The "SEQUENCE" property for the event is not
   changed from its previous value. A recipient will determine that the
   only change in the "REQUEST" is that their "RSVP" property parameter
   indicates a request for an updated status. The recipient SHOULD
   respond with a "REPLY" method indicating their current status with
   respect to the "REQUEST".

   This capability MAY also be achieved by the "Organizer" sending the
   "REFRESH" method to the "Attendees".

3.1.3     REPLY

   The "REPLY" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used to
   respond (e.g., accept or decline) to a request or to reply to a
   delegation request. When used in to provide a delegation response,



Silverberg/Mansour/Dawson/Hopson  16                   Expires MAY 1998


Internet Draft                   iTIP                  October 24, 1997


   the "delegator" SHOULD include the calendar address of the
   "delegatee" on the "DELEGATED-TO" property parameter of the
   "delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property. The "delegatee" SHOULD include the
   calendar address of the "delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" property
   parameter of the "delegatee's" "ATTENDEE" property.

   The "REPLY" method MAY also be used to respond to an unsuccessful
   "REQUEST" method. Depending on the value of the "REQUEST-STATUS"
   property no scheduling action MAY have been performed.

   The "Organizer" of an event MAY receive the "REPLY" method from a
   "Calendar User" not in the original "REQUEST". For example, a "REPLY"
   method MAY be received from a "delegatee" to an event. In addition,
   the "REPLY" method MAY be received from an unknown "Calendar User",
   forwarded the "REQUEST" from an invited "Attendee". This uninvited
   "Attendee" MAY be accepted, or the "Organizer" MAY cancel the event
   for the uninvited "Attendee" by sending them a "CANCEL" method to the
   univited "Attendee".

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Event - Reply" COMPONENT "VEVENT" METHOD "REPLY"

     MUST COMPONENT = CALPROPS (
          MUST PROPERTY = PRODID, VERSION{"2.0"}, METHOD{"REPLY"})

3.1.4     CANCEL

   The "CANCEL" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used to send
   a cancellation notice of an existing event request to the
   "Attendees". The message is sent by the "Organizer" of an event to
   the "Attendees" of the event. For a recurring event, either the whole
   event or instances of an event MAY be cancelled. To cancel the
   complete range of recurring event, the "UID" property value for the
   event MUST be specified in the "CANCEL" method. In order to cancel an
   individual instance of the event, the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value

   for the event MUST be specified in the "CANCEL" method. In order to
   cancel a sequence of recurring events, either the"RECURRENCE-ID"
   property for the first event instance in the sequence MUST be
   specified with the "RANGE" property parameter value of THISANDPRIOR
   or THISANDFUTURE to indicate cancellation of the event instances
   before and after the first event instance, respectively. Lastly,
   individual recurrence instances MAY be cancelled by specifying
   multiple"RECURRENCE-ID" properties corresponding to the instances to
   be cancelled.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     )

3.1.5     REFRESH

   The "REFRESH" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used by
   "Attendees" of an existing event to request an updated description
   from the event "Organizer". The "REFRESH" method MUST specify the
   "UID" property corresponding to the event needing update. A
   recurrence instance of an event MAY be requested by specifying the
   "RECURRENCE-ID" property corresponding to the associated event. The
   "Organizer" MUST respond with the latest description and version of
   the event. This method is intended to facilitate machine processing
   of event update requests by an "Attendee".

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Event - Refresh" COMPONENT "VEVENT" METHOD "REFRESH"

     )

3.1.6     COUNTER

   The "COUNTER" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used by an
   "Attendee" of an existing event to submit to the "Organizer" a
   counter proposal to the event description. The "Attendee" MUST send
   the message to the "Organizer" of the event.

   The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a VEVENT
   calendar component describing the complete description of the
   alternate event.

   The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the
   "Attendee" a VEVENT "DECLINECOUNTER" method. The "Organizer" accepts
   the counter proposal by sending all of the "Attendees" to the event a
   VEVENT "REQUEST" method rescheduling the event. In the later case,
   the "Organizer" SHOULD reset the individual "RSVP" property parameter
   values to TRUE on each "ATTENDEE" property in order to force a
   response by the "Attendees".

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

3.1.7     DECLINECOUNTER

   The "DECLINECOUNTER" method in a "VEVENT" calendar component is used
   by the "Organizer" of an event to reject a counter proposal submitted
   by an "Attendee". The "Organizer" MUST send the "DECLINECOUNTER"
   message to the "Attendee" that sent the "COUNTER" method to the
   "Organizer".

   The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a VEVENT
   calendar component describing the complete description of the
   alternate event.

   The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the
   "Attendee" a "DECLINECOUNTER" method. The "Organizer" accepts the
   counter proposal by sending all of the "Attendees" to the event a
   "REQUEST" method; rescheduling the event. Since this is a rescheduled
   event, the "SEQUENCE" property value will be incremented. In the
   later case, the "Organizer" SHOULD reset the individual "RSVP"
   parameter values to TRUE on all of the "ATTENDEE" properties; in
   order to force a response by the "Attendees".

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Event - Cancel" COMPONENT "VEVENT" METHOD

3.2 Methods For VFREEBUSY Component

   This section defines the property set for the methods that are
   applicable to the "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. Each of the methods
   is defined using a grammar that specifies the property constraints
   that define the particular method.

   This memo only addresses the transfer of busy time information.
   Applications desiring free time information MUST infer this from
   available busy time information.

   The busy time information within the iCalendar object MAY be grouped
   into more than one "VFREEBUSY" calendar component. This capability
   allows busy time periods to be grouped according to some common
   periodicity, such as a calendar week, month, or year. In this case,
   each "VFREEBUSY" calendar component MUST include the "ATTENDEE",
   "DTSTART" and "DTEND" properties in order to specify the source of
   the busy time information and the date and time interval over which
   the busy time information covers.

   The "FREEBUSY" property value MAY include a list of values, separated
   by the COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). Alternately, multiple busy
   time periods MAY be specified with multiple instances of the
   "FREEBUSY" property. Both forms MUST be supported by implementations
   conforming to this document. Duplicate busy time periods SHOULD NOT
   be specified in an iCalendar object. However, two different busy time
   periods MAY overlap.

   "FREEBUSY" properties SHOULD be sorted such that their values are in
   ascending order, based on the start time, and then the end time, with
   the earliest periods first. For example, today's busy time
   information SHOULD appear after yesterday's busy time information.
   And the busy time for this half hour SHOULD appear after the busy
   time for earlier today.

   Since events MAY span a day boundary, free busy time period MAY also
   span a day boundary. Individual "A" requests busy time from
   individuals "B", "C" and "D". Individual "B" and "C" replies with
   busy time data to individual "A". Individual "D" does not support
   busy time requests and does not reply with any data. If the transport
   binding supports exception messages, then a "unsupported capability"
   message is returned by individual "D" to individual "A".

   The following summarizes the methods that are defined for the
   "VFREEBUSY" calendar component.

 |================|==================================================|


3.2.1     PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is used to
   publish busy time data. The method MAY be sent from one "Calendar
   User" to any other. The purpose of the method is to provide a message
   for sending unsolicited busy time data. That is, the busy time data
   is not being sent as a "REPLY" to the receipt of a "REQUEST" method.

   Busy time intervals are represented by individual instances of the
   "FREEBUSY" property. There is one occurrence of the property for each
   busy time interval. Duplicate busy time periods SHOULD NOT be
   returned. However, two different busy time periods MAY overlap.

   The "FREEBUSY" property value MAY include a list of values, separated
   by the COMA character (ASCII decimal 44).

   "FREEBUSY" properties SHOULD be sorted such that their values are in
   ascending order, from the most recent to past. For example, today's
   busy time information SHOULD appear after yesterday's busy time
   information. And the busy time for this half hour SHOULD appear after
   the busy time for earlier today.

   Since events MAY span a day boundary, free busy time period MAY also
   span a day boundary.

   The busy time periods MAY be grouped into more than one "VFREEBUSY"
   calendar component. This capability allows busy time periods to be
   grouped according to some common periodicity, such as a calendar
   week, month, or year. In this case, each "VFREEBUSY" calendar
   component MUST include the "ATTENDEE", "DTSTART" and "DTEND"
   properties in order to specify the originator and date and time
   interval for the busy time information.

   The "ATTENDEE" property MUST be specified in the busy time
   information. The value is the "Calendar User" address of the
   originator of the busy time information.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Busy - Busy Time Publish" COMPONENT "VFREEBUSY"

     NOT COMPONENT = VJOURNAL
     NOT COMPONENT = VALARM
     )

3.2.2     REQUEST

   The "REQUEST" method in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is used to
   ask a "Calendar User" for their busy time information. The request
   MAY be for a busy time information bounded by a specific date and
   time interval.

   This message only permits requests for busy time information. The
   message is sent from a "Calendar User" requesting the busy time
   information to one or more intended recipients.

   An "ATTENDEE" property MUST be included for the originator of the
   request and each of the intended recipients that the method is sent
   to. The originator is indicated with an "ATTENDEE" property parameter
   sequence of ";ROLE=ORGANIZER". The recipients are indicated with an
   "ATTENDEE" property parameter sequence of ";ROLE=ATTENDEE". The
   requests MAY be fanned out in separate messages to the recipients,
   with each "REQUEST" method only including the associated "ATTENDEE"
   properties for the recipients of the message.

   If the originator of the "REQUEST" method is not authorized to make a
   busy time request on the recipient's calendar system, then an
   exception message is returned in a "REPLY" method, but no busy time
   data need be returned.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     NOT COMPONENT = VJOURNAL
     NOT COMPONENT = VALARM
     )

3.2.3     REPLY

   The "REPLY" method in a "VFREEBUSY" calendar component is used to
   respond to an existing busy time request. The method is sent from a
   recipient of a busy time request back to the originator of the
   request. The originator of the request is specified by the "ATTENDEE"
   property parameter sequence of ";ROLE=ORGANIZER".

   The "REPLY" method MAY also be used to respond to an unsuccessful
   "REQUEST" method. Depending on the "REQUEST-STATUS" value, no busy
   time information MAY be returned.

   Busy time intervals are represented by individual instances of the
   "FREEBUSY" property. There is one occurrence of the property for each
   busy time interval. Duplicate busy time periods SHOULD NOT be
   returned. However, two different busy time periods MAY overlap.

   The "FREEBUSY" property value MAY include a list of values, separated
   by the COMA character (ASCII decimal 44).

   "FREEBUSY" properties SHOULD be sorted such that their values are in
   ascending order, from the most recent to past. For example, today's
   busy time information SHOULD appear after yesterday's busy time
   information. And the busy time for this half hour SHOULD appear after
   the busy time for earlier today.

   Since events MAY span a day boundary, free busy time period MAY also
   span a day boundary.

   The busy time periods MAY be grouped into more than one "VFREEBUSY"
   calendar component. This capability allows busy time periods to be
   grouped according to some common periodicity, such as a calendar
   week, month, or year. In this case, each "VFREEBUSY" calendar
   component MUST include the "ATTENDEE", "DTSTART" and "DTEND"
   properties in order to identify the source and date and time range
   for the busy time data.

3.3.1     PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VTODO" calendar component has no reply
   response associated with it. Instead, it is simply a posting of an
   iCalendar object that MAY be added to a calendar by a "Calendar
   User". It requires and accepts no responses to the "Organizer". It's
   expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary "VTODO" calendar
   component as an iCalendar object. The "Organizer" MAY subsequently
   update (with another "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a "CANCEL"
   method) a previously published "VTODO" calendar component .

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

3.3.2     REQUEST

   The "REQUEST" method in a "VTODO" calendar component provides the
   following scheduling functions:

       Assign a to-do to one or more "Calendar Users";

       Reschedule an existing to-do;

       Update the details of an existing to-do, without rescheduling
        it;

       Update the completion status of "Attendees" of an existing to-
        do, without rescheduling it;

       Reconfirm an existing to-do, without rescheduling it;

       Delegate/reassign an existing to-do to another "Calendar User".

   The assigned "Calendar Users" are identified in the "VTODO" calendar
   component by individual "ATTENDEE;ROLE=ATTENDEE" property value
   sequences.

   The originator of a "REQUEST" is the "Organizer" of the to-do. The
   recipient of a "REQUEST" is the "Calendar User" assigned the to-do,
   called the Attendee. The "Attendee" uses the "REPLY" method to convey
   their acceptance and completion status to the "Organizer" of the
   "REQUEST".

   The "UID" and "SEQUENCE" properties are used to distinguish the
   various uses of the "REQUEST" method. If the "UID" property value in
   the "REQUEST" is not found on the recipient's calendar, then the
   "REQUEST" is for a new to-do. If the "UID" property value is found on
   the recipient's calendar, then the "REQUEST" is for either a
   rescheduling, an update, or a reconfirm of the "VTODO" calendar
   object.

   If the "Organizer" of the "REQUEST" method is not authorized to make
   a to-do request on the "Attendee's" calendar system, then an
   exception is returned in the "REQUEST-STATUS" property of a
   subsequent "REPLY" method, but no scheduling action is performed.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "VTODO - Request" COMPONENT "VTODO" METHOD "REQUEST"

3.3.2.1   REQUEST for Rescheduling a VTODO

   The "REQUEST" method MAY be used to reschedule a "VTODO" calendar
   component .

   A rescheduled "VTODO" calendar component involves a change to the
   existing "VTODO" calendar component in terms of it's start or due
   time or recurrence intervals and possibly the description. If the
   recipient "CUA"  of a "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID" property
   value already exists on the calendar, but that the "SEQUENCE"
   property value in the "REQUEST" is greater than the value for the
   existing VTODO, then the "REQUEST" method describes a rescheduling of
   the "VTODO" calendar component.

3.3.2.2   REQUEST for Update or Reconfirmation of a VTODO

   The "REQUEST" method MAY be used to update or reconfirm a "VTODO"
   calendar component. Reconfirmation is merely an update of "Attendee"
   completion status or overall "VTODO" calendar component status.

   An update to an existing "VTODO" calendar component does not involve
   changes to the start or due time or recurrence intervals, nor
   generally to the description for the "VTODO" calendar component. If
   the recipient "CUA" of a "REQUEST" method finds that the "UID"
   property value already exists on the calendar and that the "SEQUENCE"
   property value in the "REQUEST" is the same as the value for the
   existing event, then the "REQUEST" method describes an update of the
   "VTODO" calendar component details, but no rescheduling of the
   "VTODO" calendar component.

   The update "REQUEST" is the appropriate response to a "REFRESH"
   method sent from an "Attendee" to the "Organizer" of a "VTODO"
   calendar component.

   Unsolicited "REQUEST" methods MAY also be sent by the "Organizer" of
   a "VTODO" calendar component. The unsolicited "REQUEST" methods MAY
   be used to either update the details of the VTODO, without
   rescheduling it or to update the completion status of "Attendees" or
   the "VTODO" calendar component itself (i.e., reconfirm the VTODO).

3.3.2.3   REQUEST for Delegating a VTODO

   The "REQUEST" method MAY be used to delegate or reassign ownership of
   a "VTODO" calendar component to another "Calendar User". The
   "REQUEST" method is used to delegate the "Attendee's" role (i.e. "
   "Organizer", or "Attendee") for a "VTODO" calendar component. The
   "REQUEST" method is sent by one of the "Attendees" of an existing
   "VTODO" calendar component request to some other individual. In order
   to avoid scheduling loops, the method MUST NOT be sent from an
   "Attendee" back to the "Organizer" of the "VTODO" calendar component.
   An "Attendee" of a "VTODO" calendar component MAY NOT delegate to the
   "Organizer" of the event.

   For the purposes of this description, the "Attendee" delegating the
   "VTODO" calendar component is referred to as the "delegator". The
   "Attendee" receiving the delegation request is referred to as the
   "delegatee".

   The "delegator" of a "VTODO" calendar component MUST forward the
   existing "REQUEST" method for a "VTODO" calendar component to the
   "delegatee". The "VTODO" calendar component description MUST include
   the "delegator's" up-to-date "VTODO" calendar component definition.
   The "REQUEST" method MUST also include an "ATTENDEE" property with
   the calendar address of the "delegatee". The "delegator" MUST also
   send a "REPLY" method back to the "Organizer" with the "delegator's"
   "Attendee" property "STATUS" parameter value set to DELEGATED. In
   addition, the "DELEGATED-TO" parameter SHOULD be included with the
   calendar address of the "delegatee". A response to the delegation
   "REQUEST" is sent from the "delegatee" to the "Organizer" and
   optionally, to the "delegator". The "REPLY" method from the
   "delegatee" SHOULD include the "ATTENDEE" property with their
   calendar address and the "DELEGATED-FROM" parameter with the value of
   the "delegator's"calendar address.

   The delegation "REQUEST" method MUST assign the values of the "RSVP"
   and "EXPECT" property parameters associated with the "delegator's"
   "Attendee" property to that of the "delegatee's" "Attendee" property.
   For example if the "delegator's" "Attendee" property specifies
   "RSVP=TRUE;EXPECT=REQUEST", then the "delegatee's" "Attendee"
   property MUST specify "RSVP=TRUE;EXPECT=REQUEST".

3.3.2.4   REQUEST Forwarded To An Uninvited Calendar User

   An "Attendee" assigned a "VTODO" calendar component MAY also assign
   the "VTODO" calendar component to another new "Calendar User", not
   previously associated with the "VTODO" calendar component. The
   current "Attendee" assigned the "VTODO" calendar component
   accomplishes this scheduling action by forwarding the original
   "REQUEST" method to the new "Calendar User".

   An "Organizer" of a "VTODO" calendar component MAY also request an
   updated completion status from one of the "Attendees". This is
   achieved by the "Organizer" sending a "REQUEST" method to the
   "Attendee" with the "ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE" property sequence. The
   "SEQUENCE" property for the "VTODO" calendar component is not changed
   from its previous value. A recipient will determine that the only
   change in the "REQUEST" is that their "RSVP" property parameter
   indicates a request for an updated status. The recipient SHOULD
   respond with a "REPLY" method indicating their current status with
   respect to the "REQUEST".

3.3.2.5   REQUEST Updated Attendee Status

   An "Organizer" of a to-do MAY also request an updated status from one
   of the "Attendees". This is achieved by the "Organizer" sending a
   "REQUEST" method to the "Attendee" with the "ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE"
   property sequence. The "SEQUENCE" property for the to-do is not
   changed from its previous value. A recipient will determine that the
   only change in the "REQUEST" is that their "RSVP" property parameter
   indicates a request for an updated status. The recipient SHOULD
   respond with a "REPLY" method indicating their current status with
   respect to the "REQUEST".

   This capability MAY also be achieved by the "Organizer" sending the
   "REFRESH" method to the "Attendees".

3.3.3     REPLY

   The "REPLY" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used to respond
   (e.g., accept or decline) to a request or to reply to a delegation
   request. It is also used by an "Attendee" to update their completion
   status. When used to provide a delegation response, the "delegator"
   SHOULD include the calendar address of the "delegatee" in the
   "DELEGATED-TO" parameter of the "delegator's" "ATTENDEE" property.
   The "delegatee" SHOULD include the calendar address of the
   "delegator" on the "DELEGATED-FROM" parameter of the "delegatee's"
   "ATTENDEE" property.

   The "REPLY" method MAY also be used to respond to an unsuccessful
   "VTODO" calendar component "REQUEST" method. Depending on the
   "REQUEST-STATUS" value, no scheduling action MAY have been performed.

   The "Organizer" of a "VTODO" calendar component MAY receive a "REPLY"
   method from a "Calendar User" not in the original "REQUEST". For
   example, a "REPLY" method MAY be received from a "delegatee" of a
   "VTODO" calendar component. In addition, the "REPLY" method MAY be
   received from an unknown "Calendar User"; forwarded the "REQUEST"
   from an original "Attendee" assigned the "VTODO" calendar component.
   This uninvited "Attendee" MAY be accepted, or the "Organizer" MAY
   cancel the "VTODO" calendar component for the uninvited "Attendee" by
   sending them a "CANCEL" method.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

3.3.4     CANCEL

   The "CANCEL" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used to send a
   cancellation notice of an existing "VTODO" calendar request request
   to the "Attendees". The message is sent by the "Organizer" of a
   "VTODO" calendar component to the "Attendees" of the "VTODO" calendar
   component. For a recurring "VTODO" calendar component, either the
   whole "VTODO" calendar component or instances of a "VTODO" calendar
   component MAY be cancelled. To cancel the complete range of a
   recurring "VTODO" calendar component, the "UID" property value for
   the "VTODO" calendar component MUST be specified in the "CANCEL"
   method. In order to cancel an individual instance of a recurring
   "VTODO" calendar component, the "RECURRENCE-ID" property value for
   the "VTODO" calendar component MUST be specified in the "CANCEL"
   method. In order to cancel a sequence of instances of a recurring
   "VTODO" calendar component, either the "RECURRENCE-ID" property for
   the first instance in the sequence MUST be specified with the "RANGE"
   property parameter value of THISANDPRIOR or THISANDFUTURE; to
   indicate cancellation of the "VTODO" calendar component instances
   before and after the first instance, respectively. Lastly, individual
   recurrence instances MAY be cancelled by specifying multiple
   "RECURRENCE-ID" properties corresponding to the instances to be
   cancelled.

3.3.5     REFRESH

   The "REFRESH" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used by
   "Attendees" of an existing "VTODO" calendar component to request an
   updated description from the "Organizer" of the "VTODO" calendar
   component. The "Organizer" of the "VTODO" calendar component MAY also
   use this method to request an updated status from the "Attendees".
   The "REFRESH" method MUST specify the "UID" property corresponding to
   the "VTODO" calendar component needing update.

   A refresh of a recurrence instance of a "VTODO" calendar component
   MAY be requested by specifying the "RECURRENCE-ID" property
   corresponding to the associated "VTODO" calendar component. The
   "Organizer" MUST respond with the latest description and rendition of
   the "VTODO" calendar component. This method is intended to facilitate
   machine processing of requests for updates to a "VTODO" calendar
   component.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the

3.3.6     COUNTER

   The "COUNTER" method in a "VTODO" calendar component is used by an
   "Attendee" of an existing "VTODO" calendar component to submit to the
   "Organizer" a counter proposal for the "VTODO" calendar component.
   The "Attendee" MUST send the message to the "Organizer" of the
   "VTODO" calendar component.

   The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a "VTODO"
   calendar component describing the complete description of the
   alternate "VTODO" calendar component.

   The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the
   "Attendee" a "DECLINECOUNTER" method. The "Organizer" accepts the
   counter proposal by sending all of the "Attendees" of the "VTODO"
   calendar component a "REQUEST" method rescheduling the "VTODO"
   calendar component. In the later case, the "Organizer" SHOULD reset
   the individual "RSVP" property parameter values to TRUE on each
   "ATTENDEE" property; in order to force a response by the "Attendees".

   proposal offered by one of the "Attendees". The "Organizer" MUST send
   the message to the "Attendee" that sent the "COUNTER" method to the
   "Organizer".

   The counter proposal is an iCalendar object consisting of a "VTODO"
   calendar component describing the complete description of the
   alternate "VTODO" calendar component.

   The "Organizer" rejects the counter proposal by sending the
   "Attendee" a "DECLINECOUNTER" method. The "Organizer" accepts the
   counter proposal by sending all of the "Attendees" of the "VTODO"
   calendar component a "REQUEST" method rescheduling the "VTODO"
   calendar component. Since this is a rescheduled "VTODO", the
   "SEQUENCE" property value will be incremented. In the later case, the
   "Organizer" SHOULD reset the individual "RSVP" property parameter
   values to TRUE on all of the "ATTENDEE" properties in order to force
   a response by the "Attendees".

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

3.4 Methods For VJOURNAL Component

   This section defines the property set for the methods that are
   applicable to the "VJOURNAL" calendar component. Each of the methods
   is defined using a grammar that clarifies the property constraints
   that define the particular method.

   The following summarizes the methods that are defined for the
   "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

 +================+==================================================+
 | Method         |  Description                                     |
 |================+==================================================|
 | PUBLISH        | Post a journal entry. Used primarily as a method |
 |                | of advertising the existence of a journal entry  |
 | CANCEL         | Cancel an existing journal entry request.        |
 | REFRESH        | A request sent to the journal "Organizer" for    |
 |                | the latest version of the journal entry to be    |
 |                | resent the requester.                            |
 +================+==================================================+


3.4.1     PUBLISH

   The "PUBLISH" method in a "VJOURNAL" calendar component has no reply
   response associated with it. Instead, it is simply a posting of an
   iCalendar object that MAY be added to a calendar by a "Calendar User"
   agent. It requires and accepts no responses to the "Organizer". The
   expected usage is for encapsulating an arbitrary journal entry as an
   iCalendar object. The "Organizer" MAY subsequently update (with
   another "PUBLISH" method) or cancel (with a "CANCEL" method) a
   previously published journal entry.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Journal - Publish" COMPONENT "VJOURNAL" METHOD
          "PUBLISH

     MUST COMPONENT = CALPROPS (
          MUST PROPERTY = PRODID, VERSION{"2.0"}, METHOD{"PUBLISH"})

     NOT COMPONENT = VEVENT
     NOT COMPONENT = VTODO
     NOT COMPONENT = VALARM
     NOT COMPONENT = VFREEBUSY
     )

3.4.2     CANCEL

   The "CANCEL" method in a "VJOURNAL" calendar component is used to
   send a cancellation notice of an existing journal entry request to
   the "Attendees". The message is sent by the "Organizer" of a journal
   entry to the "Attendees" of the journal entry. For a recurring
   journal entry, either the whole journal entry or instances of a
   journal entry MAY be cancelled. To cancel the complete range of a
   recurring journal entry, the "UID" property value for the journal
   entry MUST be specified in the "CANCEL" method. In order to cancel an
   individual instance of the journal entry, the "RECURRENCE-ID"
   property value for the journal entry MUST be specified in the
   "CANCEL" method. In order to cancel a sequence of instances in a
   recurring journal entry, the "RECURRENCE-ID" property for the first
   journal entry instance in the sequence MUST be specified with the
   "RANGE" property parameter value of THISANDPRIOR or THISANDFUTURE; to
   indicate cancellation of the journal entry instances before and after
   the first journal entry instance, respectively. Lastly, individual
   recurrence instances MAY be cancelled by specifying multiple
   "RECURRENCE-ID" properties corresponding to the instances to be
   cancelled.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Journal - Cancel" COMPONENT "VJOURNAL" METHOD
          "CANCEL"

     MUST COMPONENT = CALPROPS (
          MUST PROPERTY = PRODID, VERSION{"2.0"}, METHOD{"CANCEL"})
     MUST COMPONENT = VJOURNAL (
          MUST PROPERTY = DTSTAMP, SEQUENCE{IF NE 0}, UID{UID
               associated with original REQUEST}
          MAY PROPERTY = COMMENT{provides comment from "Organizer" to
               ATTENDEE}, EXDATE, EXRULE, RECURRENCE-ID, SEQUENCE{IF EQ
               0}, STATUS{CANCELLED}
          NOT PROPERTY = ATTACH, ATTENDEE, CATEGORIES, CLASS, CONTACT,
               CREATED, DESCRIPTION, DTSTART, LAST-MODIFIED, RDATE,
               RELATED-TO, REQUEST-STATUS, RRULE, SUMMARY, URL)

3.4.3     REFRESH

   The "REFRESH" method in a "VJOURNAL" calendar component is used by
   "Attendees" of an existing journal entry to request an updated
   description from the journal entry "Organizer". The "REFRESH" method
   MUST specify the "UID" property corresponding to the journal entry
   needing update. A recurrence instance of a journal entry MAY be
   requested by specifying the"RECURRENCE-ID" property corresponding to
   the associated journal entry. The "Organizer" MUST respond with the
   latest description and version of the journal entry. This method is
   intended to facilitate machine processing of the "REFRESH" response.

   This method type is an iCalendar object that conforms to the
   following property constraints:

     (DESCRIPTION "Journal - Refresh" COMPONENT "VJOURNAL" METHOD
          "REFRESH"

     MUST COMPONENT = CALPROPS (
          MUST PROPERTY = PRODID, VERSION{"2.0"}, METHOD{"REFRESH"})

          MUST PROPERTY = ATTENDEE{address of requestor}, DTSTAMP,
               SEQUENCE{IF NE 0}, UID{UID associated with original
               REQUEST}
          MAY PROPERTY = COMMENT{provides comment from ATTENDEE to
               "Organizer"}, RECURRENCE-ID, SEQUENCE{IF EQ 0}
          NOT PROPERTY = ATTACH, CATEGORIES, CLASS, CONTACT, CREATED,
               DESCRIPTION, DTSTART, EXDATE, EXRULE, LAST-MODIFIED,
               PRIORITY, RDATE, RELATED-TO, REQUEST-STATUS, RRULE,

3.6 Implementation Considerations


3.6.1     Working With Recurrence Instances

   iCalendar includes a recurrence grammar to represent recurring
   events. The benefit of such a grammar is the ability to represent a
   number of events in a single object. However, while this simplifies
   creation of a recurring event, meeting instances MAY still need to be
   referenced. For instance, an "Attendee" MAY decline the third
   instance of a recurring Friday event. Similarly, the "Organizer" MAY
   change the time or location to a single instance of the recurring
   event.

   Since implementations MAY elect to store recurring events as either a
   single event object or a collection of discreet, related event
   objects, the protocol is designed so that each recurring instance MAY
   be both referenced and versioned. Hence, implementations that choose
   to maintain per-instance properties (such as "ATTENDEE" property
   "STATUS" parameter) MAY do so. However, the protocol does not require

Internet Draft                   iTIP                  October 24, 1997


   per-instance recognition unless the instance itself MUST be
   renegotiated.

   The scenarios for recurrence instance referencing are listed below.
   For purposes of simplification a change to an event refers to a
   "trigger property."  That is, a property that has a substantive
   affect on the meeting itself such as start time, location, due date
   (for "VTODO" calendar component components) and possibly description.

       "Organizer" initiated actions:

       "Organizer" deletes or changes a single instance of a recurring
        event

       "Organizer" makes changes that affect all future instances

       "Organizer" makes changes that affect all previous instances

       "Organizer" deletes or modifies a previously changed instance

       Attendee initiated actions:

       Attendee changes status for a particular recurrence instance

       Attendee sends Event-Counter for a particular recurrence
        instance

   An instance of a recurring event is assigned a unique identification,
   "RECURRENCE-ID" property, when that instance MUST be renegotiated.
   Negotiation is necessary when the start time, end time, due date or
   location are modified. If the "Organizer" wishes to identify a
   specific recurrence instance it is done using the "RECURRENCE-ID"
   property. The property value is equal to the date/time of the
   instance. If the "Organizer" wishes to change the"DTSTART", the
   original "DTSTART" value is used for"RECURRENCE-ID" property and the
   new "DTSTART" and "DTEND" values reflect the change. If the
   "Organizer" wishes to add a new instance to the recurring event then
   a "REQUEST" is issued with an "RDATE" property equal to the new
   instance date. It is recommended that the "Organizer" include the
   "RECURRENCE-ID" property[SS1]. Since the creation of a new event
   instance requires negotiation, the sequence number is also
   incremented.

3.6.2     Attendee Property Considerations

   The "ATTENDEE" property for the "Organizer" is required on published
   events, to-dos, and journal entries for two reasons. First, a
   published only the "Organizer" is allowed to update an event, to-do,
   or journal entry component. The "Organizer" "ATTENDEE" property MUST
   be present in the event, to-do, or journal entry component so that
   the "CUA" has a basis for authorizing an update. Second, it is
   prudent to provide a point of contact for anyone who receives a
   published component in case of problems.

   There are valid RFC 822 addresses that represent groups. Sending
   email to such an address results in mail being sent to multiple
   recipients. Such an address MAY be used as the value of an "ATTENDEE"
   property. Thus, it is possible that the recipient of a "REQUEST" does
   not appear explicitly in the list list.

   User" in an attendee list be as follows:

     1.        Search for the "Calendar User" in the attendee list where
       "TYPE=INDIVIDUAL"

     2.        Failing (1) look for attendees where "TYPE=GROUP" or
       'TYPE=UNKNOWN". The "CUA" MUST then determine if the "CU" is a
       member of one of these groups. If so, the "REPLY" method sent to
       the "Organizer" MUST contain a new "ATTENDEE" property in which
       the "TYPE" property parameter is set to INDIVIDUAL and the
       "GROUP" property parameter is set to the name of the group.

     3.        Failing (2) the "CUA" MAY ignore or accept the request as the
       "Calendar User" wishes.

3.6.3     When To Refresh An Event

   An "VEVENT" or "VTODO" calendar component SHOULD be resent to all
   "Attendees" whenever the "SEQUENCE" property is incremented or any
   other substantive change is made.

3.6.4     Timezones

   If a recurring event has any instance where "DTSTART" and "DTEND"
   fall on different sides of a time zone shift, the "VTIMEZONE"
   components are required.

   The threat of duplicate time zone definitions exists. SHOULD an
   iCalendar object contain multiple conflicting time zone components,
   the one with the latest "DTSTART" property supersedes the others.

3.6.5     Alarms

   It is recommended that application software ask the user whether or
   not they want alarms included when they read the event.

3.6.6     SUMMARY Property

   The minimum support for the "SUMMARY" property in a recipient MUST be
   for a 255 byte value. Implementations MAY truncate longer length
   values.

3.6.7     X-Tokens

   To make iCalendar objects extensible, new property types MAY be
   inserted into components. These properties are called X-Tokens as
   they are prefixed with "X-". A client is not required to make sense
   of X-Tokens. Clients are not required to save X-Tokens or use them in
   event replies.

4  Examples


4.1 Published Event Examples

   In the calendaring and scheduling context, publication refers to the
   one way transfer of event information. Consumers of published events
   simply incorporate the event into a calendar. No reply is expected.
   Individual "A" publishes an event. Individual "B" reads the event and
   incorporates it into their calendar. Events MAY be published in
   several ways including: embedding the event as an object in a web
   page, e-mailing the event to a distribution list, and posting the
   event to a newsgroup.

   The table below illustrates the sequence of events between the
   publisher and the consumers of a published event.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action                          |  "Organizer"                    |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Publish an event                | "A" sends or posts a PUBLISH    |
|                                 | message                         |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| "B" reads a published event     |                                 |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Publish an updated event        | "A" sends or posts a PUBLISH    |
|                                 | message                         |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| "B" reads the updated event     |                                 |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Cancel a published event        | "A" sends or posts a CANCEL     |
|                                 | message                         |
+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| "B" reads the canceled event    |                                 |

4.1.1     A Minimal Published Event

   The iCalendar object below describes a single event that begins on
   July 1, 1997 at 20:00 UTC. This event contains the minimum set of
   properties for a "PUBLISH" for a "VEVENT" calendar component.

     END:VCALENDAR


4.1.2     Changing A Published Event

   The iCalendar object below describes an update to the event described
   in 4.1.1, the time has been changed, an end time has been added, and
   the sequence number has been adjusted.

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     METHOD:PUBLISH
     VERSION:2.0
     PRODID:-//ACME/DesktopCalendar//EN
     BEGIN:VEVENT
     ATTENDEE;ROLE=OWNER:a@acme.com

     DTSTART:19970701T210000Z

     SUMMARY:ST. PAUL SAINTS -VS- DULUTH-SUPERIOR DUKES
     END:VEVENT
     END:VCALENDAR


   The "UID" property is used by the client to identify the event. The
   "SEQUENCE" property indicates that this is the second change to the
   event. Events with sequence numbers 0 and 1 are superseded by this
   event.

   The "SEQUENCE" property provides a reliable way to distinguish
   different versions of the same event. Each time an event is
   published, its sequence number is incremented. If a client receives
   an event with a sequence number 5 and finds it has the same event
   with sequence number 2, the event SHOULD be updated. However, if the
   client received an event with sequence number 2 and finds it already
   has sequence number 5 of the same event, the event SHOULD NOT be
   updated.

4.1.3     Canceling A Published Event

   The iCalendar object below cancels the event described in 4.1.1. This
   cancels the event with "SEQUENCE" property of 0, 1, and 2.

   The "CLASS" property is specified, though it is not really needed
   here. Since this is a published event, a program that displays it
   need not apply any content filtering based on the "CLASS" attribute.
   If this event is copied into a user뭩 calendar, the "CLASS" would be
   included as part of the copy.  The handling of the "CLASS" tag at
   that point is implementation specific.

   The "RELATED-TO" field contains the "UID" property of a related
   calendar event. The handling of this property is application
   dependent.

   The "SEQUENCE" property 3 indicates that this event supersedes
   versions 0, 1, and 2.

4.1.5     Anniversaries or Events attached to entire days

   This example demonstrates the use of the "value" parameter to tie a
   VEVENT to day rather than a specific time.

4.2 Group Event Examples

   Group events are distinguished from published events in that they
   have "Attendees" and that there is interaction between the
   "Attendees" with respect to the event. Individual "A" requests a
   meeting between individuals "A", "B", "C" and "D". Individual "B"
   confirms attendance to the meeting. Individual "C" declines
   attendance. Individual "D" tentatively confirms their attendance.
   This is sometimes referred to as "penciling-in" the event on a
   calendar. The following table illustrates the sequence of messages
   that would be exchanged between these individuals. The table below
   illustrates the message flow.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

4.2.5     Delegate An Event

   When delegating an event request to another "Calendar User", the
   "delegator" MUST both update the "Organizer" with a "REPLY" and send
   a request to the "delegatee". There is currently no protocol
   limitation to delegation depth. It is possible for the original
   delegate to delegate the meeting to someone else, and so on. When a
   request is delegated from one "CUA" to another there are a number of
   responsibilities required of the "delegator". They MUST:

Internet Draft                   iTIP                  October 24, 1997


       Send an REPLY to the "Organizer" with their attendee/status
        property parameter set to "Delegated"

       Include the delegate as an additional attendee with the
        "Delegated-From" property parameter set to the delegator

       Include the original UID of the REQUEST

       The delegator MUST also send a copy of the original REQUEST to
        the delegate. The delegator modifies the request to include:

       The ATTENDEE/STATUS property parameter for the delegator
        (sender in this case) is set to "DELEGATED"

       ATTENDEE/DELEGATED-TO parameter is set to the address of the
        delegatee

       An ATTENDEE property is added for delegatee

   As a rule, it is not required that the "delegatee" include the
   "delegator" in their "REPLY" method. However, it is strongly advised
   since this will inform the "delegator" whether their proxy plans to
   attend the meeting. If the "delegatee" declines the meeting, the
   "delegator" MAY elect to try and delegate the "REQUEST" to another
   "CUA". The process is the same.

4.2.6     Delegate Accepts the Meeting

   To accept a delegated meeting, the delegate sends the following
   message to "A" and "C"

4.2.7     Delegate Declines the Meeting

   In this example the delegate declines the meeting request and sets
   the "ATTENDEE" property "STATUS" parameter to DECLINED. The
   "Organizer" SHOULD resend the "REQUEST" to "C" with the status of the
   delegate set to DECLINED. This lets the "delegator" know that the
   "delegate" has declined and provides an opportunity to the
   "delegator" to either accept or delegate the request to another
   "Calendar User".

4.2.8     Forwarding an Event Request

   The protocol does not prevent an "Attendee" from "forwarding" an
   "VEVENT" calendar component to other "Calendar Users". Forwarding
   differs from delegation in that the forwarded "Calendar User" (often
   referred to as a "Party Crasher") does not replace the forwarding
   "Calendar User". Implementations are not required to add the "Party
   Crasher" to the "Attendee" list and hence there is no guarantee that
   a "Party Crasher" will receive additional updates to the Event. The
   forwarding "Calendar User" SHOULD NOT add the "Party Crasher" to the
   attendee list.

4.2.9     Cancel A Group Event

   Individual "A" requests a meeting between individuals "A", "B" and
   "C". Individual "B" declines attendance to the meeting. Individual
   "A" decides to cancel the meeting. The following table illustrates
   the sequence of messages that would be exchanged between these
   individuals.

   Messages related to a previously canceled event ("SEQUENCE" property
   value is less than the "SEQUENCE" property value of the "CANCEL"
   message) or "VTODO" calendar component MUST be ignored.

   The "VTIMEZONE" components SHOULD appear in an iCalendar object
   containing recurring events. This is especially important if a
   recurring event has "Attendees" in different time zones. There MAY be
   multiple VTIMEZONE components in an iCalendar object, however, they
   MUST be used to define the same time zone. That is, there cannot be
   VTIMEZONE components describing both PST/PDT and EST/EDT at the
   component level in the same iCalendar object.

   The first two components of this iCalendar object are the time zone
   components. The "DTSTART" date coincides with the first instance of
   the RRULE property.

   The recurring meeting is defined in a particular time zone,
   presumably that of the originator. The client for each "Attendee" has
   the responsibility of determining the recurrence time in the
   "Attendee's" time zone.

   The repeating event starts on Tuesday, July 1, 1997 at 2:00pm. Since
   no time zone is specified in the "DTSTART" property, the time zone
   component of PDT applies to the start and end times. "Attendee"
   gb@mcom.fr is in France where the local time on this date is 7 hours
   later than PDT or 21:00. "Attendee" kimiko@mcom.jp is in Japan where
   local time is 9 hours ahead of than UTC or Wednesday, July 2 at
   07:00. The event repeats weekly on Tuesdays (in PST/PDT). The "RRULE"
   property results in 20 instances. The last instance falls on Tuesday,
   November 11, 1997 2:00pm PST. The "RDATE" property adds another
   instance: WED, 10-SEP-1997 21:00 GMT.

   There are two exceptions to this recurring appointment. The first one
   is:

4.5 Group To-do Examples

   Individual "A" creates a group task in which individuals "A", "B",
   "C" and "D" will participate. Individual "B" confirms acceptance of
   the task. Individual "C" declines the task. Individual "D"
   tentatively accepts the task. The following table illustrates the
   sequence of messages that would be exchanged between these
   individuals. Individual "A" then issues a "REFRESH" method to obtain
   the status of the to-do from each participant. The response indicates
   the individual "Attendee's" completion status. The table below
   illustrates the message flow.

4.5.7.2   Calculating due dates in recurring VTODOs

   The due date in a recurring "VTODO" calendar component is either a
   fixed interval specified in the "REQUEST" method or specified
   specifically using the "RECURRENCE-ID" property. The former is
   calculated by applying the difference between "DTSTART" and "DUE"
   properties and applying it to each of the start of each recurring
   instance. Hence, if the initial "VTODO" calendar component specifies
   a "DTSTART" property value of "19970701T190000Z" and a "DUE" property
   value of "19970801T190000Z" the interval of one day which could be
   applied to each recurring instance of the "VTODO" calendar component.

4.5.7.3   Replying to an instance of a recurring VTODO

   In this example "B" updates "A" on a single instance of the "VTODO"
   calendar component.

   "B" has the event with "UID" property"acme-12345@host1.com" but the
   "SEQUENCE" property value is "1" and the event does not have an
   instance at the specified recurrence time. This means that the
   "Owner" is either adding a new instance or that the new instance was
   added when "SEQUENCE" property value "2" of the event was generated.
   In either case, "B" needs a new copy of the event.

5.2 Latency Issues

   With a store-and-forward transport, it is possible for events to
   arrive out of sequence. That is, you MAY receive a "CANCEL" method
   prior to receiving the associated "REQUEST" for the calendar
   component. This section discusses a few of these scenarios.

5.2.1     Cancellation of an Unknown Calendar Component.

   When a "CANCEL" method is received before the original "REQUEST"
   method the calendar will be unable to correlate the "UID" property of
   the cancellation with an existing calendar component. It is suggested
   that messages that can not be correlated that also contain non-zero
   sequence numbers be held and not discarded. Implementations MAY age
   them out if no other messages arrive with the same "UID" property
   value and a lower sequence number.

5.2.2     Unexpected Reply from an Unknown Delegate

   When an "Attendee" delegates an item to another "Calendar User" they
   MUST send a "REPLY" method to the "Organizer" using the "ATTENDEE"
   properties to indicate the fact that the request was delegated and to
   whom the item was delegated. Hence it is possible for an "Organizer"
   to receive an "REPLY" from a "Calendar User" not listed as one of the
   original "Attendees". The resolution is left to the implementation
   but it is expected that the calendaring software will either accept
   the reply or hold it until the related "REPLY" method is received
   from the "delegator". If the version of the "REPLY" method is out of
   date the "Organizer" SHOULD treat the message as a "STATUS-REQUEST"
   and update the delegate with the correct version.

Internet Draft                   iTIP                  October 24, 1997


5.3 Sequence Number

   Under some conditions, a "CUA" MAY receive requests and replies with
   the same "SEQUENCE" property value. The "DTSTAMP" property is
   utilized as a tie-breaker when two items with the same "SEQUENCE"
   property value are evaluated. Furthermore, the "SEQUENCE" property is
   only incremented when one or more of the following properties
   changes:

       DTSTART

       DTEND

       RDATE

       RRULE

       EXDATE

       EXRULE

       DUE (for VTODO components)

       and possibly LOCATION

6  Security Considerations

   This memo outlines an abstract transport protocol which will be bound
   to a real-time transport, a store-and-forward transport, and perhaps
   other transports. The transport protocol will be responsible for
   providing facilities for authentication and encryption using standard
   Internet mechanisms that are mutually understood between the sender
   and receiver.

6.1 Security Threats


6.1.1     Spoofing the "Organizer"

   In this memo, the "Organizer" is the only person authorized to make
   changes to an existing "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL" calendar
   component and redistribute the updates to the "Attendees". An
   iCalendar object that maliciously changes or cancels an existing
   "VEVENT", "VTODO" or "VJOURNAL" calendar component MAY be constructed
   by someone other than the "Organizer" and sent to the "Attendees".

6.1.2     Spoofing the "Attendee"

   In this memo, an "Attendee" of a "VEVENT", "VTODO", "VJOURNAL"
   calendar component is the only person authorized to update any
   parameter associated with their "ATTENDEE" property and send it to
   the "Organizer". An iCalendar object that maliciously changes the
   "ATTENDEE" parameters MAY be constructed by someone other than the
   real "Attendee" and sent to the "Organizer".

6.1.3     Eavesdropping

   The iCalendar object is constructed with human-readable clear text.
   Any information contained in an iCalendar object MAY be read and/or
   changed by unauthorized persons while the object is in transit.

6.1.4     Flooding a Calendar

   Implementations MAY provide a means to automatically incorporate
   "REQUEST" methods into a calendar.  This presents the opportunity for
   a calendar to be flooded with requests, which effectively block all
   the calendar's free time.

6.1.5     Procedural Alarms

   The "REQUEST" methods for "VEVENT" and "VTODO" calendar components
   MAY contain "VALARM" calendar components. The "VALARM" calendar
   component MAY be of type PROCEDURE and MAY have an attachment
   containing some sort of executable program. Implementations that
   incorporate these types of alarms are subject to any virus or
   malicious attack that MAY occur as a result of executing the
   attachment.

6.2 Recommendations

   For an application where the information is sensitive or critical and
   the network is subject is subject to a high probability of attack,
   iTIP transactions SHOULD be secured. This MAY be accomplished using
   public key technology, specifically Security Multiparts for MIME
   [RFC1847] in the iTIP transport binding.  This helps mitigate the
   threats of spoofing, eavesdropping and malicious changes in transit.

6.2.1     Use of [RFC1847] to secure iTIP transactions

   iTIP transport bindings SHOULD provide a mechanism based on Security
   Multiparts for MIME [RFC1847] to enable authentication of the
   sender뭩 identity, and privacy and integrity of the data being
   transmitted. This allows the receiver of a signed iCalendar object to
   verify the identity of the sender. This sender MAY then be correlated
   to an "ATTENDEE" property in the iCalendar object. If the correlation
   is made and the sender is authorized to make the requested change or
   update then the operation MAY proceed. It also allows the message to
   be encrypted to prevent unauthorized reading of the message contents
   in transit. iTIP transport binding documents describe this process in
   detail.

6.2.2     Implementation Controls

   The threat of flooding a calendar SHOULD be mitigated by a calendar
   system that uses this protocol by providing controls that MAY be used
   to limit the acceptable sources for iTIP transactions, and perhaps
   the size of messages and volume of traffic, by source.

   The threat of malicious procedural alarms SHOULD be mitigated by a
   calendar system that uses this protocol by providing controls that
   MAY be used to disallow procedural alarms in iTIP transactions and/or
   remove all alarms from the object before delivery to the recipient.
