1. Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]


2. Introduction

   Most of the new IANA registries, and respective iana allocation
   processes for protocols defined in the PWE3 IETF working group can be
   found in this document. The IANA registries defined here, are in
   general subdivided into three main ranges: a range to be allocated by
   IETF consensus according to [RFC2434], a range to be allocated by the
   expert review process according to [RFC2434], and a range to be
   allocated in a first come first served basis reserved for vendor
   proprietary allocations. It should be noted that vendor proprietary
   types MUST NOT be registered for IETF standards or extensions of
   those, whether still in development or already completed.

Internet Draft   draft-ietf-pwe3-iana-allocation-15.txt    November 2005


3. IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create several registries as described in the
   following paragraphs. Each of these registries contains numeric
   values used to identify data types. In each of these registries the
   value of 0 is reserved, and MUST not be used.


3.1. Expert Review Directives

   Throughout this document allocation procedures for several registries
   call for an expert review process according to [RFC2434]. The expert
   should consider the following points:

     * Avoid Duplication of code point allocations.
     * A brief clear description of the code point allocation requested.
     * Whether the type allocation requested is appropriate for the
       particular requested value range in the registry.

   The Expert reviewing the request MUST provide an answer, approving,
   or disapproving the request within 10 business days from when the he
   or she received the expert review request.


3.2. MPLS Pseudowire Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "MPLS Pseudowire Type". These are
   15-bit values. PW Type values 1 through 30 are specified in this
   document, PW Type values 31 through 1024 are to be assigned by IANA,
   using the "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC2434]. PW Type values
   1025 through 4096, and 32767 are to be allocated using the IETF
   consensus policy defined in [RFC2434]. PW Type values 4097 through
   32766 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions and are to be
   assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined
   in [RFC2434]. A Pseudowire Type description is required for any
   assignment from this registry.  Additionally, for the vendor
   proprietary extensions range a citation of a person or company name
   is also required. A document reference should also be provided.

   Initial Pseudowire type value allocations are specified below:

3.3. Interface Parameters Sub-TLV type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Interface Parameter
   Sub-TLV types". These are 8 bit values. Sub-TLV types 1 through 12
   are specified in this document. Sub-TLV types 13 through 64 are to be
   assigned by IANA, using the "Expert Review" policy defined in
   [RFC2434]. Sub-TLV types 65 through 127, and 255 are to be allocated
   using the IETF consensus policy defined in [RFC2434]. Sub-TLV types
   values 128 through 254 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions
   and are to be assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served"
   policy defined in [RFC2434].

   Any assignments requested from this registry require a description up
   to 54 characters.

   For each allocation a length field MUST also be specified in one of
   the following formats:
     - Text as follows:"up to X", where X is a decimal integer
     - Up to 3 different decimal integers.

   The text "up to X" is meant to mean up to and including X.

   Additionally, for the vendor proprietary extensions range a citation
   of a person or company name is also required.  A document reference
   should also be provided.

   Initial Pseudowire Interface Parameter Sub-TLV type allocations are

   Note that the Length field is defined as the length of the Sub-TLV
   including the Sub-TLV type and length field itself.


3.4. Attachment Identifiers

3.4.1. Attachment Individual Identifier Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Attachment Individual Identifier
   (AII) Type". These are 8-bit values. AII Type value 1 is defined in
   this document.  AII Type values 2 through 64 are to be assigned by
   IANA using the "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC2434]. AII Type
   values 65 through 127, and 255 are to be allocated using the IETF
   consensus policy defined in [RFC2434]. AII types values 128 through
   254 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions and are to be
   assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined
   in [RFC2434].

   Any assignments requested from this registry require a description up
   to 54 characters.

   For each allocation a length field MUST also be specified as a
   decimal integer.

   Additionally, for the vendor proprietary extensions range a citation
   of a person or company name is also required.  A document reference
   should also be provided.

   Initial Attachment Individual Identifier (AII) Type allocations are
   specified below:

   AII Type     Length    Description                          Reference

   0x01         4      A 32 bit unsigned number local identifier. [SIG]


3.4.2. Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) Type

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Attachment Group Identifier (AGI)
   Type".  These are 8-bit values. AGI Type value 1 is defined in this
   document.  AGI Type values 2 through 64 are to be assigned by IANA
   using the "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC2434]. AGI Type
   values 65 through 127, and 255 are to be allocated using the IETF
   consensus policy defined in [RFC2434].  AGI types values 128 through
   254 are reserved for vendor proprietary extensions and are to be
   assigned by IANA, using the "First Come First Served" policy defined
   in [RFC2434].

   Any assignments requested from this registry require a description up
   to 54 characters.

   For each allocation a length field MUST also be specified as a
   decimal integer.

   Additionally, for the vendor proprietary extensions range a citation
   of a person or company name is also required.  A document reference
   should also be provided.

   Initial Attachment Group Identifier (AGI) Type allocations are
   specified below:

   AGI Type     Length    Description                        Reference
   0x01         8      Route distinguisher (RD)                [SIG]


3.5. Pseudo Wire Status

   IANA needs to set up a registry of "Pseudowire Status Codes". These
   are bit strings of length 32. Status bits 0 to 4 are defined in this
   document.  Status bits 5 to 31 are to be assigned by IANA using the
   "Expert Review" policy defined in [RFC2434].

   Any requests for allocation from this registry require a description
   up to 65 characters.

   Initial Pseudowire Status Codes value allocations are as follows:

    Bit MaskDescription
   0x00000000 - Pseudo Wire forwarding (clear all failures)      [CRTL]
   0x00000001 - Pseudo Wire Not Forwarding                       [CRTL]
   0x00000002 - Local Attachment Circuit (ingress) Receive Fault [CRTL]

4. Security Considerations

   This document specifies only fixed identifiers, and not the protocols
   used to carry the encapsulated packets across the network.  Each such
   protocol may have its own set of security issues, but those issues
   are not affected by the identifiers specified herein.
