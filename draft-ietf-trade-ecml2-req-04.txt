INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements                 July 2001


1. Introduction

   ECML Version 2.0 will describe the syntax of a class of data objects
   called Payment Processing Objects. This will involve the development
   of a hierarchically organized set of data elements and an XML syntax
   for payment transaction information for both electronic wallets and
   Business to Business (B2B) payment types such as credit card,
   electronic check, line of credit, ACH (Automated Clearing House,)
   Mobile Phone Payments, and PDA Payments.

   This document lists the design principles, scope, and requirements
   over three things: (1) the scope of work available to the WG, (2) the
   ECML version 2 specification, and (3) applications that implement the
   specification. It includes requirements as they relate to the payment
   element syntax, data model, format, implementation, and external
   requirements. Those things that are required are designated as
   "must", those things that are optional are designated by "may", those
   things that are optional but recommended are designated as "should".



1.1 Relationship to Other Standards

   The set of fields documented herein was started by the ECML Alliance
   [ECML] which developed the North American / HTML form field oriented
   Versions 1 and 1.1 of ECML [RFC 2706, 3106].  Control and development
   of future versions of the standard has been transferred to the IETF.

   The ECML Version 1 fields were initially derived from and are
   consistent with the W3C P3P base data schema [P3P BASE].  Version 2
   extends the fields provided to encompass [P3P ECOM] and selected
   additional fields from [ISO 8583], [JCM], or other sources.

   ECML Version 2.0 is not a replacement or alternative to TLS [RFC
   2246], SET [SET], EMV [EMV], XML [XML], or IOTP [RFC 2801]. These are
   important standards that provide functionality such as
   confidentiality, non-repudiatable transactions, automatable payment
   scheme selection, and smart card support.



2. Design Principles and Scope

   1. The specification must describe the fields necessary to process a
      payment between a consumer and merchant or between two businesses,
      describing the XML syntax and content in particular.

   2. Keep the addition of fields beyond those in ECML v1.1 [RFC 3106]
      to a minimum.

INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements                 July 2001


   3. Maintain all existing functionality from ECML v1.1.  In essence,
      ECML v2 should be a superset of ECML v1.1.

   4. Increase the flexibility of the standard to include other forms of
      payments.  These include ACH, Mobile Phone, PDA, Purchasing Card
      and electronic check. See [P3P ECOM, JCM], etc.

   5. Allow for use of a common and uniform DTD with back-end payment
      systems such as Enterprise Resource Provision (ERP), Card Line
      Item Detail (LID) Level II & Level III, etc.

   6. Allow for use of the standard with Business to Business (B2B)
      payment vehicles, such as B2B Wallets, Marketplaces, etc.

   7. Create a usage/implementation guide section of the specification
      to cover additional use cases for functionality included.

   8. ECML version 2 may include the concept of an offer.

   9. ECML version 2 should be developed as part of the broader Web
      design philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data, modularity
      /layering / extensibility, and assertions as statements about
      statements. [Berners-Lee, WebData, XML, XML Name] In this context,
      this standard should take advantage of existing provider (and
      infrastructure) primitives.



3. Requirements

   ECML v2 must cover the data types and other requirements enumerated
   in this section. It should provide for asserting and querying
   relavent element values.



3.1 Payment Processing Elements

      1. Cost
      2. Receipt
      3. Currency
      4. Card
      5. Payment
      6. Bank/Telco

INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements                 July 2001


3.2 Payment Processing Types

      1. All current Processing types for ECML 1.1 [RFC 3106].
      2. Automated Clearing hosue [ACH]
      3. Electronic check [eCheck]
      4. Mobile phone payments
      5. PDA payments



3.3 XML Data Model and Syntax

      1. A well-formed DTD and possibly schema need to be developed to
         include new fields in this standard.

      2. A W3C Note may be drafted to document changes from [W3C ECOM].



3.4 Implementation

      1. The ECML version 2 specification should meet the requirements
         of the following applications:
            a. Internet Open Trading Protocol v1.0 [IOTP]

            b. Check against representative ACH, electronic check, and Mobile
            Phone payment setup.

      2. Test all XML DTDs, schemas and XML examples inculded the
         specification to insure that they are well-formed XML.

      3. Compare completeness against (in accordance with standard's
         goals:)
            1. ECML v1.1 [RFC 3106]
            2. Using P3P for E-Commerce [P3P NOTE]
            3. Financial transaction card originated messages [ISO 8583]
            4. Java Commerce Messages [JCM]
            5. cXML
            6. ebXML
            7. BizTalk



3.5 Detailed Requests

   The following are specific comments received on claimed deficiencies
   in ECML v1.1 and should all be considered for possible inclusion in
   ECML v2.

      1. Increase Last Name field minimum required support to at least


J. Parsons, D. Shepherd, D. Eastlake                            [Page 5]


INTERNET-DRAFT            ECML v2 Requirements                 July 2001


         22 characters.

      2. Improved Internationalization support.

      3. Longer minimum supported telephone number and email fields.

      4. Provide a "translation field" which would specify a mapping
         between existing fields and ECML specified fields.  The
         addition of such a field in ECML v2 (which would normally be
         hidden when presented in HTML) would permit ECML support with
         no change to existing fields or code.  ECML code could fill in
         existing fields based on the ECML field they map to.



4. Security Considerations

   Many ECML fields contain sensitive private information.  ECML is
   dependent upon

   - the security of the transmission infrastructure used to send such
     private inforamtion and

   - the security of applications which store or release such sensitive
     information.

   ECML need not add any security mechansims to this infrastructure or
   these applications. The ECML v2 specification must include adequate
   warnings and suggested courses of action to protect this information.
