Abstract
   
   This memo presents a set of extensions for supporting explicit rate
   congestion control using RSVP. It should be perceived as an extension
   to the RSVP functional specifications [RFC2205]
   
   These extensions include the standard format of the ER_SPEC object,
   and a description of RSVP's handling of the ER_SPEC object.
   
   This document does not advocate a particular distributed explicit
   rate congestion control algorithm.

1. Introduction
   
   This memo defines a message format and protocol for signaling
   explicit rate congestion control information using RSVP. This
   extension is designed for use in Multiprotocol Label Switched (MPLS)
   network as a mechanism for enabling the calculating of explicit
   weighted fair rates for point-to-point Label Switched Paths (LSPs).


2. Terminology
   
   The terminology used in this document is covered in the RSVP
   Specification [RFC2205] or the MPLS Architecture [RFC3031].


3. Conventions Used In This Document
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


4. Overview of Explicit Rate Congestion Control
   
   MPLS LSPs created using the Controlled-Load service [RFC2211] are
   best effort. In best effort service, network connections are not
   prevented from offering traffic at an unconstrained rate. Networks
   will, in times of congestion, drop best effort traffic. Dropping
   packets arbitrarily leads to network inefficiencies (as packets are
   not dropped as early as possible), and unfairness for network LSPs.

   Explicit Rate congestion control is a mechanism whereby explicit
   rates are assigned to best effort LSPs. Explicit rates change
   dynamically as network conditions change.
   
   An Explicit Rate congestion control system consists of a mechanism
   for periodically signaling explicit rates, and a distributed explicit
   rate algorithm for assigning rates. Distributed explicit rate
   congestion control algorithms work at each node in a network path to
   cooperatively set explicit rates for network connections using an
   appropriate signaling mechanism. This memo proposes a signaling
   mechanism for assigning explicit rates for point-to-point LSPs in
   MPLS networks.


5. The EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC Parameter Definition
   
   The EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC is carried as a parameter in the SENDER_TSPEC
   and FLOWSPEC objects (in a manner similar to the TOKEN_BUCKET_TSPEC
   [RFC2215]) for services requesting explicit rate congestion control
   feedback. This parameter is used by data senders to describe traffic
   it expects to generate, and by explicit rate control services to
   describe the explicit capacity available to the sender. It is defined
   as a general rather than service-specific parameter because the same
   traffic description may be used by several QoS control services
   [RFC2210] in some situations.
   
   The EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC parameter is assigned parameter_number TBD.
   The format of the EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC parameter is shown below.

   1   |   TBD         |    0          |             3                 |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   2   |  Explicit Rate [e] (32-bit IEEE floating point number)        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   3   |  Minimum Rate  [m] (32-bit IEEE floating point number)        |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   4   |  Weight        [w] (32-bit integer)                           |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   
   
   
   The EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC takes the form of an explicit rate [e],
   minimum rate [m], and a weight [w]. The values for [e] and [m] must
   be non-negative, the value for [w] must be positive.
   
   The explicit rate [r] and minimum rate [m] are measured in bytes of
   IP datagrams per second. Values of [r] and [m] range from 0 bytes per
   second to 40 terabytes per second. In practice, only the first few

   digits of the [e] and [m] parameters are significant, so the use of
   floating point representations, accurate to at least 0.1% is
   encouraged.
   
   The range of values allowed for these parameters is intentionally
   large to allow for future network technologies. A particular network
   element is not expected to support the full range of values.
   
   The weight, [w], is a positive integer value without units. Its value
   indicates a relative weight for the connection.
   
   The XDR description of this parameter is:
   
   struct {
   
         float e;
   
         float m;
   
      unsigned w;
   
   } EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC;
   
   For the fields [e] and [m] only valid non-negative floating point
   numbers are allowed. Negative numbers (including "negative zero),
   infinities, and NAN's are not allowed.
      
      NOTE: An implementation which utilizes general-purpose hardware
      or software IEEE floating-point support may wish to verify that
      arriving parameter values meet these requirements before using
      the values in floating-point computations, in order to avoid
      unexpected exceptions or traps.


6. Use of the EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC Parameter
   
   The EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC is a parameter to the SENDER_TSPEC object in
   the RSVP PATH message and the FLOWSPEC object in the RSVP RESV
   message. It is intended to be used as a mechanism for driving a
   distributed explicit rate algorithm for point-to-point LSPs in MPLS
   networks.
   
   It is expected that, for LSPs requiring explicit rate service, the
   source Label Switched Router (LSR) will, at regular intervals,
   forward an RSVP PATH message containing a EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC. The
   source LSR will set the explicit rate field of the
   EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC to a peak rate for the LSP.
   
   RSVP enabled LSRs receiving PATH and RESV messages containing an
   EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC parameter MUST forward them immediately.

Internet-Draft        RSVP ER Congesion Control in MPLS       March 2006



   Destination LSRs receiving an RSVP PATH message containing an
   EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC object MUST create a corresponding RSVP RESV
   message with an identical EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC parameter and forward
   immediately.
   
   In the direction from source to destination (RSVP PATH), intermediate
   LSRs MAY update the explicit rate field of an EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC to
   a value less than the received value. In the direction from
   destination to source (RSVP RESV), intermediate LSRs MUST leave the
   EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC unchanged.


7. Security Considerations
   
   This memo describes the use of EXPLICIT_RATE_SPEC parameter to carry
   explicit rate congestion control information between RSVP nodes. To
   ensure message integrity, the RSVP integrity mechanism specified in
   [MD5] ca be used to provide a chain of trust when all RSVP nodes are
   policy capable
