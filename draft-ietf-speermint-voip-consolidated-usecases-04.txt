     Abstract 

        This document will capture VoIP use case for SIP Peering.  It is a 
        consolidation of Speermint use cases drafts. This document depicts 
        many common VoIP peering use cases. These use cases are categorized 
        into three types: Direct, Indirect and Assisted. They are not the 
        exhaust set of use cases but the most common use cases deployed in 
        production today. This document captures them to provide a reference.

     1. Introduction 

        This document attempts to capture VoIP use cases for Session 
        Initiation Protocol (SIP)[1] based peering.  These use cases will 
        assist in identifying requirements and future works for VoIP Peering 
        using SIP. 
         
        Only use cases related to VoIP are considered in this document.  
        Other real-time SIP communications use cases, like Instant Messaging 
        (IM) and presence are out of scope for this document.  In describing 
        use cases, the intent is descriptive, not prescriptive.   
         
        There are existing documents [2][3][4][5][6] that have captured use 
        case scenarios.  This draft draws from those documents.  The document 
        contains three categories of use cases; Direct, Indirect and 
        Assisted.  The use cases contained in this document attempts to be as 
        comprehensive as possible, but should not be considered the exclusive 
        set of user cases. 
         
     2. Terminology 

        Many terms in this document are referenced to the Speermint 
        terminology draft [15]. We also use few additional terms to describe 
        the VoIP use cases. We define them in this section.

        o Location Server (LS): A server called upon by originating SSP, 
           either Local or Remote, to obtain the Session Establish Data 
           (SED). Often, the input to the server is an E.164 number and the 
           SED is a SIP URI. The originating SSP's client may call the 
           Location Function using ENUM Query/Response, SIP Invite/Redirect, 
           or other method depending on originating SSP's infrastructure and 
           methods available for the data being interrogated, with the 
           response format being appropriate to the Query format. In the 
           case of an ENUM Query, the response should be a NAPTR record 
           containing the sip URI that can be resolved by the client. In the 
           case of a SIP Invite/Redirect, the response should be a SIP 
           Redirect (30X) message containing the URI. 

        o Session Manager (SM): A SM is the home registrar of the user 
           endpoint. SM is responsible to receive and send SIP messages from 
           the peer. If the user endpoint speaks non-SIP, SM will translate 
           the non-SIP protocol to SIP protocol and vice versa. 

        o Session Border Element (SBE) : A SBE performs signaling sanitation 
           and security tasks in the signaling plane of Session 
           establishment. Common threats may be DOS or intentionally 
           malformed packet/headers.  This device may perform NAT/PAT or 
           enable far-end NAT traversal. 

        o Data Border Element (DBE) : The DBE performs similar functions as 
           the SBE, but in the media or data plane.  

        o User Endpoint (UE): User Endpoint is the client that makes or 
           receives calls. UE can be sip based or non-sip based. For non-sip 
           based UE, SM acts as a signaling gateway and translates the non-
           sip signaling to sip signaling before sending to SBE.  

        In this document, we use “O” to indicate “Originating”, “T” to 
        indicate “Terminating”, “t” to indicate “Transit”, and “A” to 
        indicate “Assisted”. For example, O-SBE is the acronym of Originating 
        SBE.

        PLEASE NOTE: In figure one – the elements defined are optional in 
        many use cases. 

         

     3. Contexts of Use Cases 

        Use cases are sorted into 3 general groupings: Direct, Indirect and 
        Assisted. Though there may be some overlap among the use cases in 
        these categories, there are different requirements between the 
        scenarios and this document serves to help identify the requirements 
        for SIP Peering for VoIP.  The following definitions are taken from 
        the Speermint Terminology draft[15]. 

     3.1. Direct Peering 

        Direct peering describes those cases in which two service providers 
        interconnect without using an intervening layer 5 network. 
      
      
     Uzelac (et al.)          Expires Mar 30, 2008                  [Page 5] 
         






     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases  Mar 2008 
         

     3.2. Indirect Peering 

        Indirect, or transit, peering refers to the establishment of either a 
        signaling and media path or signaling path alone via one (or more) 
        referral or transit network(s). In this case it is generally required 
        that a trust relationship is established between the originating 
        service provider and the transit network on one side, and the transit 
        network and the termination network on the other side. 
         

     3.3. Assisted Peering 

        In this case, some entity (usually a 3rd party or federation) 
        provides peering assistance to either the originating or terminating 
        SIP Service Provider (SSP) by providing one or more functions 
        assisting in the routing of SIP requests and the establishment of SIP 
        dialogs and sessions between peers.  The assisting entity may provide 
        information relating to direct or indirect peering as necessary. 
         

     4. Functions in the Use Cases 

        Each use case will follow functions as defined in the Speermint 
        Terminology draft [15]. 

     4.1. Look-Up Function 

        The Look-Up Function (LUF) provides a mechanism for querying an 
        internal and/or external database, which maintains a list of SIP user 
        name and associated peering domains. 

     4.2. Location Function 

        The Location Function (LF) develops call routing data (CRD) by 
        discovering the Signaling Function (SF) and the SF’s reachable host 
        (IP Address and port). 

     4.3. Signaling Function 

        The Signaling Function (SF) performs routing of SIP messages, to 
        optionally perform termination and re-initiation of a sessions, and 
        to assist in the discovery/exchange of parameters to be used ny the 
        Media Function

     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases  Mar 2008 
         

     4.4. Media Function 

        The Media Function (MF) performs media related function suck as 
        media, DTMF, etc transcoding and media security implementation 
        between two (or more) SSPs. 

     5. Use Cases 

        Please note, there are intra-domain message flows within the use 
        cases to serve as supporting background information.  Only inter-
        domain communications is germane to Speermint. We divide the use 
        cases into two major categories: Static Peering and On-demand 
        Peering. Each peering category can sub-divide to Direct and Indirect. 
        Besides, O-SSP and T-SSP can decide to use A-SSP for the peering. 

     5.1. Static Peering Use Cases 

        Static Peering [15] describes two SSP form the peering relationship 
        with pre-association. 

     5.1.1. Static Direct Use Case 

        This is the simplest use case. Two SSP negotiate and agree to 
        establish a SIP peering relation. The peer connection is statically 
        configured and directly connected two SSP. Besides, they exchange 
        peer information such as DSCP policies, subscriber SIP-URI and proxy 
        location prior to establishing the connection. They only accept 
        traffic originating directly from the trusted peer.

        Figure 2 Direct Peering 
         

        The following is a high-level depiction of the use case. 

          1. O-UE initiates a call via SIP INVITE 

          2. O-SM queries for next-hop information from a routing database. 
             This is the Look-up Function as described in the terminology 
             draft. 

          3. Routing database entity replies with route to called party 

          4. Call sent to terminating domains session manager. 

          5. Session manager determines called party status and directs call 
             to called party. 

          6. RTP is established between O-UE and T-UE. 

         

     5.1.1.1. Assisted SSP for Static Direct Use Case 

        Given the O-SSP policy, the O-SSP may request assistance from A-SSP 
        to provide LF and LUF. For example, A-SSP provides ENUM service to O-
        SSP to translate the TEL-URI to S-URI. Since O-SSP and T-SSP have 
        direct Layer-5 connectivity, they do not require A-SSP for signaling. 
        If O-SSP and T-SSP have their own LF and LUF, they can establish the 
        peer relationship without any A-SSP involved.

     5.1.1.2. Administrative characteristics 

        The static direct use case is typically implemented in a scenario 
        where exists a strong degree of trust between the 2 administrative 
        domains. Both administrative domains normally sign a peer agreement 
        which state clearly the peering policies and terms.  

     5.1.1.3. Options and Nuances 

        In Figure 2, O-SM and T-SM connect directly. An operator may decide 
        to deploy a SBE between its SM and the peer network. Normally, the 
        operator will deploy the SBE in the edge of its administrative 
        domain. The signaling traffic will pass between two networks through 
        the SBE. The operator has many reasons to deploy a SBE. For example, 
        the SM may use RFC1918 addresses that are not routable in the peer 
        operator network. The SBE can perform NAT function. Also, the SBE 
        eases the operation cost for deploying old or removing new SM. 
        Consider the deployment architecture where multiple SMs connect to a 
        single SBE. An operator can add or remove a SM without coordinating 
        with the peer operator. The peer operator sees only the SBE. As long 
        as the SBE maintain intact, the peer operator does not need to be 
        notified.  

        When an operator deploys a SBE, the operator is required to advertise 
        the SBE to the peer LS so that the peer operator can locate the SBE 
        and route the traffic to the SBE accordingly. 

        SBE deployment is a decision within an administrative domain. Either 
        administrative domain or both administrative domains can decide to 
        deploy SBE. To the peer network, most important is to identify the 
        next-hop address. Whether next-hop is SM or SBE, the peer network 
        will not see any difference. 

     5.1.2. Static Indirect Use Case 

        Similar to the Static Direct Use Case, O-SSP and T-SSP has pre-
        arranged assignment for the peer relationship. The difference between 
        Static Direct Use Case and Static Indirect Use Case is the O-SSP and 
        T-SSP do not have direct Layer-5 connectivity. They require one or 
        multiple Transit Domains to assist routing the SIP messages.

          1. O-UE initiates a call. 

          2. The O-SM performs next-hop determination for the called party.

     5.1.2.1. Assisted SSP for Static Indirect Use Case 

        Similar to the Static Direct Use Case, O-SSP can use an A-SSP to 
        provide LUF and LF. In addition, O-SSP must use an A-SSP for SF  to 
        act as the transit domain to route SIP messages to T-SSP. Note that 
        O-SSP can use multiple A-SSP for LUF, LF and SF. There is no 
        requirement to have one A-SSP to provide all the functions 

     5.1.2.2. Administrative characteristics 

        The Static Indirect Use Case is normally implemented in cases where 
        no direct interconnection exists between originating and terminating 
        domains due to either business or physical constraints.   

        Orig Domain .--. Transit = Relationship O-T 

        In the O-T relationship, typical policies, features or functions that 
        deem this relationship necessary are NP, Ubiquity of termination 
        options, and masquerading of originating VoIP network gear. 

        Term Domain .--. Transit = Relationship T-T 

        In the T-T relationship, typical policies, features or functions 
        observed consist of codec “scrubbing”, anonimizing, and transcoding. 

     5.1.2.3. Options and Nuances 

        In Figure 3, the A-SSP serves only the O-SSP and T-SSP. It is 
        possible that A-SSP serves as the hub for multiple SSPs. Each SSP is 
        the spoke to the A-SSP which does not need to have direct connections 
        among other SSPs. To originate a call to a remote number, the SSP 
        will send the SIP request to the A-SSP. A-SSP is the default peer for 
        all the numbers that are unknown to the O-SSPs. A-SSP can route the 
        call to one of its served SSP or to PSTN if A-SSP can’t locate the 
        next-hop for that call in its own LS. The routing logic in the A-SSP 
        is hidden to the SSP. Figure 4 shows the high-level network setup.

        Figure 4 Hub-and-Spoke Assisted SSP 
         
        A-SSP facilitates direct session establishment between the O-SSP and 
        T-SSP.  There may be elements that provide SIP proxy functionality, 
        and are often implemented in practice by SBE(s) and DBE(s) which may 
        "filter" or "normalize" and provide network-hiding for incoming 
        messages en route to their final destination.  Fear and distrust 
        coupled with continued interoperability and security concerns have 
        revived the need for the neutral central element role enabled by this 
        peering model. 

        Popularity of this model can be attributed to the concentration of 
        functions provided by A-SSP.  As an external element, A-SSP can 
        provide the full set of services for SSPs, and through its own 
        relationships with the SSP eliminate the need of all SSPs for pair-
        wise service relationships.  A-SSP can potentially encompass a large 
        namespace of users that is accessible in one query to external SSP 
        members (or not -depending on policy).   

        In addition there is an interoperability function usually performed 
        by an A-SSP SBE, almost guaranteeing interoperability and protocol 
        interchangeability between member SSPs.  As part of the 
        interoperability there is also is media sub-function enabling the 
        federation to enforce a standard set of codecs or alternatively 
        provide transcoding functionality to make sure there is media 
        interoperability as well. Finally, A-SSP can implement the routing

        function enabling traffic shaping and throttling across the 
        federation. 

     5.2. On-demand Peering Use Cases 

        On-demand Peering [15] describes two SSP form the peering 
        relationship without pre-arranged agreement. 

     5.2.1. On-demand Direct Use Case 

        The basis of this use case is built on the fact that there is NOT a 
        pre-established relationship between the O-SSP and the T-SSP.  The O-
        SSP and T-SSP did not share any information prior to the dialog 
        initiation request. When the O-SM invokes the LUF and LF on the R-
        URI, the terminating user information must be publicly available. 
        Besides, when the O-SM routes the request to the T-SM, the T-SM must 
        accept the request without any pre-association with O-SSP. 

     5.2.1.1. Assisted SSP for On-demand Indirect Use Case 

        Given the O-SSP policy, the O-SM may invoke A-SSP for one or more 
        assistances. In On-demand peering, the A-SSP must publicly announce 
        what assisted functions it provides and accept any on-demand request. 

     5.2.1.2. Administrative characteristics 

        The On-demand Direct Use Case is typically implemented in a scenario 
        where the T-SSP allows any O-SSP to reach its serving subscribers. T-
        SSP administrative domain does not require any pre-arranged agreement 
        to accept the call. T-SSP makes its subscribers information available 
        in public. This model mimics the email model. Sender does not need an 
        agreement to send email to the receiver. 

     5.2.1.3. Options and Nuances 

        Similar to Static Direct Use Case. O-SSP and T-SSP can decide to 
        deploy SBE. T-SSP is open to the public, T-SSP should prepare to 
        suffer from the spam problem existing in email system. VoIP spamming 
        is considered more annoying than email spamming to the subscribers. 
        T-SSP must apply rules to filter spammed calls. 

     5.2.2. On-demand Indirect Use Case 

        The difference between Direct and Indirect Use Case is the O-SSP 
        invokes an A-SSP to forward requests to T-SSP blindly, regardless of 
        LUF or LF. This use case is also referring to a “transit” model of 
        SIP peering.  Similar to the On-demand Direct Use Case model, the A-
      
      
     Uzelac (et al.)          Expires Mar 30, 2008                 [Page 13] 
         






     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases  Mar 2008 
         

        SSP must publicly announce that it accepts request and is capable to 
        route the request to the T-SSP. 

     5.2.2.1. Assisted SSP for On-demand Indirect Use Case 

        Given the O-SSP policy, the O-SM may invoke a A-SSP similar to the 
        procedures described in the Direct On-demand Use Case. 

     5.2.2.2. Administrative Characteristics 

        The On-demand In-direct Use Case describes a scenario where T-SSP 
        accepts any call from O-SSP and O-SSP does not have direct Layer-5 
        connectivity to the T-SSP. O-SSP will rely on its A-SSP to forward 
        the SIP request to the T-SSP. This use case is useful for enterprises 
        where they rely on the trusted A-SSP to handle incoming and outgoing 
        requests. 

     5.2.2.3. Options and Nuances 

        T-SSP shares the same problems of which On-demand Indirect Use Case 
        suffers. T-SSP should apply filter rules for VoIP spam. 

     6. Federations 

          This section discusses the federation concept, explains which 
          technical parameters make up the foundation of a federation and 
          provides examples. 
           
          Contrary to the previous section, this section does not focus on 
          specific implementation details like the presence of SBCs or other 
          border elements. The aim here is to provide a broader view on what 
          kinds of arrangements are possible. 
           
          The concrete implementation details (e.g. "direct with one SBC" 
          versus "direct with two SBCs") can involve all the use cases thus 
          far described in the document. 
         

     6.1. Federation Considerations 

          Each federation has to specify how a few core operations which are 
          to be performed by its members. 
           
          These include: 
           
          1. Peer Discovery 

      
      
     Uzelac (et al.)          Expires Mar 30, 2008                 [Page 14] 
         






     Internet-Draft draft-ietf-speermint-voip-consolidated-usecases  Mar 2008 
         

          This specifies how a SSPs discovers that he can place a specify 
          call to a peering partner in this federation. 
           
          Possible solution are e.g.: a manually configured list of TN-
          prefixes and domain names, automatically obtained list of reachable 
          prefixes/domains by some sort if intra-federation route 
          announcements, trial queries to the federation's LS, trial lookups 
          in federation-internal databases (e.g. private DNS),public database 
          lookups (e.g. I-ENUM). 
         
          2. Location Server 

          What methods are used for TN to URI mapping? 
           
          Examples: Public User-ENUM, public Infrastructure ENUM, private 
          ENUM tree, SIP Redirect, DUNDi. 
           
          3. Next Hop Domain Resolution 

          If the LS did not return an URI of the form sip:user@IP-address, 
          then the originating SSP has to translate the domain part of the  
          URI to an IP-address (plus perhaps fall-backs) in order to contact 
          the next hop.  
           
          Examples: RFC3263 in the public DNS. RFC3263 in a federation 
          private DNS. RFC3263 in the public DNS with split-DNS, P2P SIP, 
          modified RFC3263 in the public DNS (e.g. a federation-specific 
          prefix to the domain name). 
         
          4. Call Setup 

          The federation may also define specifics on what SIP features need 
          to be used when contacting the next hop in order to a) reach the 
          next hop at all and b) to prove that the sender is a legitimate 
          peering partner. 
           
          Examples: hard-code transport (TCP/UDP/TLS), non-standard port 
          number, specific source IP address (e.g. in a private L3 network), 
          which TLS client certificate to use, other authentication scheme. 
            
          5. Filtering Incoming Calls 

          On the receiving side, the border element needs to determine 
          whether the INVITE it just received really came from a member   of 
          the federation. This is the flip side of 4.

          Example: verify TLS cert, check incoming interface/VLAN,check 
          source IP address against a configured list of valid ones. 
         
     6.2. Federation Examples 

          This section lists some examples of how federations can operate. 
           
     6.2.1. Trivial Federations 

          A private peering arrangement between two SSPs is a special case of 
          a federation. These two SSP have agreed to exchange calls amongst 
          themselves and they have set up whatever SBC/LS/SBE plus Layer 
          3infrastructure they need to route and complete the calls. 
           
          It is thus not needed to treat bi-lateral peerings as conceptually 
          different to federation-based peering. 
           
          On the other extreme, the set of all SSPs implementing an open SIP 
          service according to RFCs 3261/3263/3761 also fulfills the 
          definition of a federation.  In that case, the technical rules are 
          contained in these three RFCs, the LS is the public DNS. Whether 
          some of these SSPs use SBCs as border elements is not relevant. 
           
          The administrative model of this federation is the "email model": 
          There is no "member list", any SIP server operating on the Internet 
          which implements call routing according to these RFCs is implicitly 
          a member of that federation. No business relationship is needed 
          between "members", thus no money is likely to change hands for 
          terminating calls. There is no contractual protection against 
          nuisance calls, SPIT, or denial of service attacks. 
         
     6.2.2. Access List based 

          If running an open SIP proxy is not desired, then a group of SSPs 
          which want to allow calls from each other can collect the list of 
          IP addresses of all their border elements. 
           
          This list is redistributed to all members which use it to configure 
          firewalls in front of their ingress elements.  Thus calls from 
          other members of this federation are accepted while calls from 
          other hosts on the Internet are blocked. 
           
          Whether SSPs deploy SBCs as border elements is not relevant.  Call 
          routing can still be done via standard RFC rules. 
           
          Whenever a new member joins this club every other SSP needs to 
          adapt its filter rules.

     6.2.3. TLS based Federations 

          Another option to restrict incoming calls to federation members is 
          to use Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates as access 
          control. This works best if the federation runs a certificate 
          authority (CA) which signs the TLS keys of each member SSP.  Thus 
          the ingress element of a SSP needs to check only whether the client 
          certificate presented by the calling SIP proxy contains a proper 
          signature from that CA. 
           
          Adding support for Certificate Revocation Lists solves the issue of 
          blocking calls from former members of that federation.  The main 
          benefit of this model is that no changes need to be made at the 
          ingress element of all old members whenever a SSP joins that 
          federation. 
           
     6.2.4. Central SIP Proxy 

          One way to simplify the management of these firewall rules is to 
          route all SIP messages via a central proxy. 
           
          In that case, all federation members just need to open up their 
          ingress elements to requests from that central server. A new SSP 
          just triggers a change in the configuration of this box and not at 
          all other SSPs. 
           
          While centralized solutions may entail typical hub-and-spoke 
          architecture considerations, the added overall federation 
          scalability with respect to the number of interconnects required, 
          their associated policies and management make this approach quite 
          popular today. 
           
          This is an example of Assisted Peering. 
      

     6.2.4.1. Architecture, scalability and business scalability 

          The network architecture which in the case centralized model would 
          reflect a hub and spoke model - should be weighed against a 
          distributed model. While such a centralized model presents well-
          known network and server scalability challenges, a distributed 
          model requires higher interconnection complexity, reflected in 
          provisioning and the need for the maintenance of such 
          relationships.

     6.2.5. Private Layer 3 Network 

          Federations can also establish a separate layer 3 network for their 
          peering traffic. This could be implemented e.g. by creating a new 
          VLAN at an Internet exchange point to which all members of that 
          federation connect their SBEs. 
           
          Alternatively, a federation can establish a smaller version of the 
          Internet to which only members are allowed to connect.  The GRX 
          network of the mobile operators is an example of a dedicated layer 
          3 infrastructure. 
           
          Such a private layer 3 network can also be implemented using 
          virtual private network (VPN) technologies like IPsec. 
           
          In all these cases the SBE can assume that any SIP requests it 
          receives via an interfaces located in this L3 network comes from 
          legitimate peering partner. 
           
          The separation of the peering network from the Internet makes it 
          easier to protect the peering arrangement from attacks and to 
          ensure QoS. 
           
     6.2.6. Peer to Peer SIP 

          P2PSIP replaces the RFC3263 rules by a lookup in a distributed hash 
          table (DHT). A federation could use this technology to implement 
          call routing between the peers: the border elements of all members 
          participate in the DHT algorithm and distribute routing information 
          this way. 
           
          Only members of the federation thus can use information stored in 
          the DHT which could be the basis of both call routing within the 
          federation as well as access control between members. 
           
     6.2.7. DUNDi 

          Distributed Universal Number Discovery (DUNDi) 
          [http://www.dundi.com/dundi.txt] can also be used to build 
          federations: DUNDi itself acts as a distributed LS which can add 
          dynamically generated passwords to the URIs it returns. 
           
          This way, the T-SBE can verify that an incoming calls comes from a 
          member of this DUNDi cloud.

     7. Security Considerations 

          This document introduces no new security considerations.  However, 
          it is important to note that session interconnect, as described in 
          this document, has a wide variety of security issues that should be    
          considered in documents addressing both protocol and use case  
          analyzes. 
           
     8. IANA Considerations 

          This document creates no new requirements on IANA namespaces    
          [RFC2434].
