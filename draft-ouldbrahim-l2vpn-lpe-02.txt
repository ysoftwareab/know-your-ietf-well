        Service Providers offer Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also 
        known as Transparent LAN Service (TLS), as part of their Layer 2 
        VPN offering. VPLS simulates an Ethernet Virtual 802.1d bridge

        From an end-user's perspective, a VPLS ties geographically

        equipment into the provider Ethernet ports, and interconnecting 
        them to other provider customer facing ports across the Service 
        Provider metro or wide area network. Such providerÆs edge 
        devices store information related to customer VPLS domains and 
        are responsible for making forwarding decisions related to 
        customers VPLS traffic. A problem arises when there is need to 
        provide a network-based VPLS solution that scales to a large 
        number of VPLSs, each with potentially a large number of 
        customer ports while at the same time providing a solution that 
        is cost-effective and reliable for the Service ProvidersÆ access 
        infrastructure. This draft introduces the "Logical PE" 
        architecture to effectively address the scalability of VPLS 
        services.

     2. Introduction 
      
        Service Providers offer Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), also 
        known as Transparent LAN Service (TLS), as part of their Layer 2 
        VPN offering. VPLS simulates an Ethernet Virtual 802.1d bridge 
        for given set of customers across metro or wide area networks. 
        From an end-user's perspective, a VPLS ties geographically 
        separate customer sites together as if they share a common LAN 
        segment. A VPLS service is built by attaching customer LAN 
        equipment into the provider Ethernet ports, and interconnecting 
        them to other provider customer facing ports across the Service 
        Provider metro or wide area network. Such providerÆs edge 
        devices store information related to customer VPLS domains and 
        are responsible for making forwarding decisions related to 
        customers VPLS traffic. A problem arises when there is need to 
        provide a network-based VPLS solution that scales to a large 
        number of VPLSs, each with potentially a large number of

     2.1 What is VPLS Service? 
         
        Initially introduced in [RFC-2764], and adopted in [VPLS-REQ], 
        a Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) is a VPN service, which 
        emulates a LAN segment using IP based facilities. A VPLS can be 
        used to provide what is known as a Transparent LAN Service 
        (TLS) used to interconnect multiple customer edge devices (CEs) 
        (e.g., bridges, router, routing switch) across a shared 
        Ethernet and IP/MPLS Service Provider network infrastructure. 
        The primary benefits of a VPLS are complete protocol 
        transparency, which are important both for multi-protocol 
        transport and for regulatory reasons in the Service Provider 
        context.  
      
        From an end-user's perspective, a VPLS ties geographically 
        separate sites together as if they share a common LAN segment. 
        A VPLS network is built by attaching customer LAN equipment 
        into the provider Ethernet ports, and interconnecting them to 
        other provider customer facing ports across the service 
        provider network. The end user does not need to know exactly 
        how the packets are delivered only that they are delivered 
        unmodified to the proper sites. Multiple VPLS services can be 
        provided on a single service provider network. A provider edge 
        device (PE) can support multiple VPLS services. 
      
      
     2.2 VPLS/L2VPN Reference Model 
         
        The VPLS service reference model follows the models described 
        in [PPVPN-REQ] and [VPLS-REQ]. A service provider may offer 
        VPLS services where a customer edge device (CE), which can be a 
        layer 2 Ethernet switch, a server, a router, a routing switch 
        or an Ethernet bridge, is attached to a service provider edge 
        device (PE). PEs are connected to providerÆs internal devices 
        (P) which are considered VPLS unaware. P devices participate in 
        providing tunnels/LSP between PE devices across the providers 
        packet switched IP/MPLS core network infrastructure. This 
        reference model is similar to existing layer-3 and point-to-
        point reference models. 
         
      
     2.3 VPLS Functions 
         
        It is possible to describe the VPLS functions based on a 
        functional model as shown in Figure 1.

     2.3.1 VPLS Control Plane Functions 
         
     2.3.1.1 VPLS Membership Auto-discovery 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.      Expires August 2002                 [Page 5]

        Auto-discovery function (e.g., [BGP-AD]) is necessary for any 
        network-based VPNs in order to meet network scalability 
        requirements. For VPLS, auto-discovery allows a VPLS aware 
        device to find all other VPLS aware devices that contain the 
        same VPLS membership. It may happen that the auto-discovery 
        mechanism extends to also provide other VPLS information such 
        as encapsulation/multiplexing scheme to be used to forward 
        private frames across the tunnels (e.g., [L2VPN-KOMP]). BGP 
        based auto-discovery mechanism can also be used in the core to 
        inform each VPLS aware device about VPLS membership information 
        (e.g., described in [BGP-AD], and [L2VPN-KOMP]).            
      
      
     2.3.1.2 VPLS Transport Tunnel Signaling 
         
        VPLS traffic between VPLS aware devices can be tunneled across 
        Service Provider IP/MPLS packet switched core using tunneling 
        mechanism such as MPLS, Qtag, GRE, L2TP, and IPSec etc. 
         
        In the core network, point-to-point tunnels can be created 
        using either [L2VPN-KOMP], or [MARTINI-TRANSP] type 
        architectures (e.g., [L2VPN-ROSEN]). It is possible that the 
        transport tunnel signaling might be integrated with auto-
        discovery mechanism or decoupled with auto-discovery 
        mechanisms. When using MPLS as the tunneling mechanism, bi-
        directional LSPs need to be established between each VPLS 
        endpoint.  
      
      
     2.3.1.3 VPLS Topology & Loop Prevention 
         
        In order to preclude the need for traffic between two VPLS 
        aware devices to transit through another VPLS VPLS aware 
        device, which would then require the use of the Spanning Tree 
        protocol; fully meshed point-to-point VPLS topology between VBs 
        can be used. The PE has the functionality to receive frames 
        from the attached CEs and make a decision to what egress tunnel 
        the frame should be forwarded. MAC learning is achieved through 
        the data plane through broadcast/flooding on each per VPLS 
        circuit (within the VPLS domain). 
         
        Another topology that can be used is virtual bridge/switch 
        model that is similar to layer-3 VPN virtual router/VRF models 
        except that each VPLS edge device implements link layer 
        forwarding rather than network layer forwarding. Virtual 
        bridge/switches are connected through point-to-point private 
        tunnels. As such, most of the layer-3 VPN tunneling and 
        configuration mechanisms discussed in [PPVPN-FRAME] can also be 
        used for virtual switches, with the appropriate changes to 
        accommodate link layer, rather than network layer, packets and

        addressing information. Care must be taken to avoid formation 
        of forwarding loops. 
         
      
     2.3.1.4 Service Label Signaling 
      
        Signaling is required to distribute the Service Label in a VPLS 
        solution. Service Label is used at VPLS aware egress device to 
        multiplex multiple VPLS services over the VPLS transport 
        tunnels and at VPLS aware egress device to distinguish 
        individual emulated VPLS Ethernet frames within a single VPLS 
        transport tunnel and the source VPLS aware device. 
         
        Service Label signaling can be carried out using mechanism 
        specified in [MARTINI-TRANSP], [L2VPN-KOMP] etc. 
         
         
     2.3.2 VPLS Forwarding Plane Functions 
      
     2.3.2.1 VPLS MAC Learning 
         
        MAC learning deals with the case where an Ethernet frame, 
        received from customer let say CE1, arrives at the ingress  
        PE1 with a source MAC address A and a destination MAC address 
        B. B is not an entry in PE1 address look-up table. Mechanisms 
        like broadcast/multicast flooding can be used to inform every 
        other PE device in the same VPLS of the unknown destination 
        address frame, and eventually the packet is received by B. 
        Source MAC learning will be accomplished by storing the source 
        information with its path (i.e., PE/tunnel) at each PE member 
        of the VPLS. One mechanism is to bind the service tunnel (e.g., 
        VC Label in [MARTINI-TRANSP] with the source MAC address. 
        Therefore future lookup on a packet received by the PE having 
        the learned MAC destination address will produce a VC LSP that 
        can be used to forward the packet to the proper egress PE 
        device.  
         
         
     2.3.2.2 Customer VLAN Processing 
         
        A customer VLAN identification, using some scheme such as IEEE 
        802.1q tags, customers port configurations or other means, 
        allow for separate broadcast domain within the same customer 
        network. A VPLS service can be extended to recognize customer 
        VLAN identification in context of the VPLS that the VLAN is 
        part of. Each of these customer domains needs to appear as a 
        separate broadcast domain within the VPLS solution. However the 
        VPLS service should not constrain the customerÆs ability to 
        configure VLAN topologies, VLAN tags etc. 
         
         
     2.3.2.3 Customer Packet Replication/Flooding

        A VPLS needs to have a broadcast capability.  This is needed 
        both for broadcast and multicast frames, and for link layer 
        packet flooding, where a unicast frame is flooded because the 
        path to the destination link layer address may be unknown. 
      
         
     2.3.2.4 Virtual Bridging/Switching 
         
        The three functions listed under the Sections 2.3.2.1, 2.3.2.2 
        and 2.3.2.3, essentially allow the VPLS to offer Virtual 802.1d 
        Bridging/Switching capabilities. It is called Virtual since 
        bridging/switching occurs on across a core IP/MPLS network 
        infrastructure.  
      
      
     2.3.2.5 Customer Packet Encapsulation 
         
        To forward an Ethernet frame, a VPLS aware device must be able 
        to associate a destination MAC address with a VPLS emulated 
        circuit in the transport tunnel. To allow dynamic learning and 
        association of destination MAC addresses with VPLS emulated 
        circuits in transport tunnels across the core IP/MPLS network 
        infrastructure, Ethernet frames need to be encapsulated at the 
        VPLS aware ingress device. 
         
        For example, such encapsulation can be carried out as per 
        [MARTINI-ENCAPS] that defines a dual label stack. One label is 
        needed to transport the frame across the IP/MPLS core while the 
        other contains demultiplexing information about the enclosed 
        frame that is necessary in order to properly emulate the layer 
        2 services. 
         
         
     2.3.2.6 Service Label De-multiplexing 
         
        Service Label De-multiplexing is required to distinguish 
        individual emulated VPLS Ethernet frames within a single VPLS 
        transport tunnel. Such de-multiplexing is to be carried out at 
        the VPLS aware egress device. The service label de-multiplexing 
        can be based on VPLS transport tunneling protocol e.g., an MPLS 
        label (e.g. in [MARTINI-ENCAPS]) or a GRE key field. 
         
         
     2.3.2.7 VPLS Resiliency 
          
        VPLS resiliency is an important consideration to ensure service 
        availability in presence of failures. Indeed, VPLS, like any 
        other layer-2 scheme is subject to failures like link, trunk 
        and node failures. Besides the Service Provider core network 
        infrastructure resiliency, considerations of access network 
        resiliency are also important. Upon the occurrence of failure, 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.      Expires August 2002                 [Page 8] 
      
     draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-02.txt                           March 2002 
      
      
        it is desirable that the failure be detected immediately and 
        protection mechanisms allow fast restoration times to make VPLS 
        service almost transparent to these failures to the extent 
        possible, based on the level of resiliency. 
         
        Essential aspects of providing resiliency are: 
        - Link/Node failure detection û Mechanisms within the VPLS 
          service should allow for link or node failures that impact 
          the Service, and should be detected immediately. 
        - Resiliency policy û Depending upon the VPLS service 
          specification in associated SLA, the detected failure be 
          handled based on restoration policy. It may need to be 
          handled immediately, or handled only if no other critical 
          failure needs protection resources or completely ignored if 
          the VPLS service being offered allows acceptable downtimes. 
          This could also determine if the resiliency is revertive or 
          non-revertive. 
        - Restoration Mechanisms û The VPLS solutions could allow for 
          physical level protection, logical level protection or both. 
          For example, through dual homing of customer connections to 
          provider customer-facing devices, one connection can be 
          maintained as active while the other could be marked as a 
          backup and upon the failure detection across the primary 
          connection, the backup could become active. 
         
      
     2.3.2.8 VPLS QoS 
         
        Based on the customer VPLS SLA, traffic from customer can be 
        prioritized, policed and shaped for Quality of Service 
        requirements. The queuing and forwarding policies can preserve 
        the packet order and QoS parameters of customer VPLS traffic. 
        Combining the bandwidth flexibility of Ethernet with the 
        sophisticated traffic engineering tools of MPLS enables Service 
        Providers realistic opportunities to offer differentiated class 
        of services. 
         
        The class of services can be mapped from customer Ethernet 
        priority information e.g. 802.1p or it can be independent of 
        it. QoS functions can be listed as follows: 
         
        - Customer Traffic Prioritization û VPLS service could be best 
          effort or QoS guaranteed. Traffic from one customer might 
          need to be prioritized over others when sharing same network 
          resources. This requires capabilities within the VPLS 
          solution to classify and mark priority to QoS guaranteed 
          customer traffic. 
        - Policing û This ensures that a user of VPLS service uses VPLS 
          network resources within the limits of the agreed SLA. Any 
          excess VPLS traffic can be rejected or handled differently 
          based on provider policy.

     draft-ouldbrahim-l2vpn-lpe-02.txt                           March 2002 
      
      
        - Shaping û Under some cases the random nature of VPLS traffic 
          might lead to sub-optimal utilization of network resources. 
          Through queuing and forwarding mechanisms the traffic can be 
          shaped without altering the packet order. 
         
         
     2.3.3 VPLS Management Plane & OAM&P Functions 
         
     2.3.3.1 VPLS Configurations 
         
        It is desirable that a VPLS is designed to need minimal 
        configuration when adding or deleting customer-facing ports to, 
        or from, a given VPLS where several disjoint instances of VPLS 
        within same network infrastructure could exist. 
         
        To associate a PE level customer-facing port to the VPLS, a 
        common mechanism used is to associate a VPN membership scheme 
        to the VPLS. Thereby any port member of a given VPLS will be 
        assigned the same VPN membership ID. A common VPN membership 
        scheme is to use the VPN-IDs format [RFC-2685].  
         
        The topology of the VPLS could be manipulated by controlling 
        the configuration of peer devices at each VPLS edge device 
        combined with an auto-discovery mechanism. 
         
      
     2.3.3.2 Operations and Maintenance Functions 
         
        A VPLS solution can provide mechanisms to manage and monitor 
        different VPLS components. From a Service Level Agreement (SLA) 
        perspective, VPLS solution could allow monitoring of VPLS 
        service characteristics and offer mechanisms used by Service 
        Providers to report such monitored statistical data.  
         
        Trouble-shooting and verification of operational and 
        maintenance activities of VPLS service are essential 
        requirements for Service Providers. 
         
         
     3. VPLS Deployment and Scaling Issues 
         
        A Service Provider access/metro network might have small low-
        cost provider provisioned devices at the customer premises 
        connected to a device at the providerÆs central office. The 
        devices at the central office tend to have more functional 
        capabilities compared to the low-cost devices at customer 
        premises. The provider provisioned low-cost devices typically 
        interface with the customer edge devices. 
         
        VPLS Service deployment has operational, cost and scalability 
        considerations. While cost and operational overhead for a 
        service needs to be minimal, it should be highly scalable.  
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.      Expires August 2002                [Page 10]

        Architecting a scalable network-based VPLS solution faces 
        challenges related to the nature of the Ethernet technology 
        itself and the network-based VPN mechanisms used. Most of 
        existing VPLS solutions attempt to address the VPLS architecture 
        within a problem space similar to the layer-3 and point-to-point 
        layer-2 VPNs. Although the layer-3/2 VPN problem space is indeed 
        part of the VPLS problem space, VPLS contains some unique 
        properties. 
         
        Layer-2 VPN solutions extend the concept of traditional layer-2 
        circuits to accommodate VPN constructs like membership, auto-
        discovery, tunneling, and topology discovery. VPN Scalability is 
        addressed mostly through aggregation and auto-discovery 
        mechanisms. Aggregation offers the ability to multiplex multiple 
        VPNs over shared network pipes. Auto-discovery provides the 
        ability to dynamically discover the VPN members and hence 
        simplifies service provisioning within the network (e.g., single 
        ended provisioning). 
         
        An Ethernet VPLS solution meets the scaling requirement where 
        the PEs facing customer devices and attached to a core network 
        need to perform MAC learning for all VPLS instances. Besides 
        providing VPLS services, these PEs may also be used to provide 
        other VPN services e.g. layer-3 VPNs or point to point L2VPNs.  
      
        One way of achieving scaling, reliability and cost objectives is 
        to distribute VPLS and VPN functional elements like MAC 
        learning, auto-discovery, aggregation etc among multiple 
        provider devices. This concept is manifested by "Logical PE" 
        architecture that distributes the functional elements between 
        providerÆs customer-facing edge devices, called "PE-Edges", and 
        providerÆs core-attached edge devices, called "PE-Cores". 
        Another objective of the Logical PE approach besides scaling is 
        to be able to fit nicely with all existing VPN technologies 
        supported in the service provider networks e.g. [VPN-VR], [VPN-
        RFC2547bis], [L2VPN-KOMP], [L2VPN-ROSEN] and [OVPN], thus 
        preventing Service Providers from vendor lock-ins. 
      
         
     4. Logical PE (LPE) Architecture 
         
        As discussed in Section 3, Logical PE architecture fits nicely 
        with Service ProviderÆs typical access network. This section 
        describes the LPE architecture with its related building blocks 
        and functions. 
         
         
     4.1 LPE Definition 
      
        The LPE addresses VPLS scalability and reliability by 
        distributing VPLS functional elements among providerÆs 
        customer-facing edge devices, called ôPE-Edgesö and providerÆs 
      
     Ould-Brahim, et al.      Expires August 2002                [Page 11]

        core-attached edge devices, called ôPE-Coresö, as shown in 
        Figure 2. 
         
        The concept of separate PE-Edge and PE-Core edge devices does 
        not prevent the distributed VPLS functional elements from being 
        implemented within the same physical device.  PE-Edge devices 
        are not mandatory for building Service ProviderÆs VPLS access 
        network. However, the value addition to the VPLS services for a 
        Service Provider are reasons enough for large scale VPLS 
        service to be preferably implemented across low-cost Ethernet-
        based ôPE-Edgeö devices and high capacity core-attached ôPE-
        Coreö edge devices, as explained later in Section 4.2

                  Figure 2: Logical PE with PE-Edges and PE-Cores 
      
      
        PE-Edges and PE-Cores can be interconnected by switched 
        Ethernet transport network(s) or directly connected links 
        within a LPE. Note that the PE-Core device might also need to 
        support PE-Edge functions when some customer sites might be 
        directly connected to them, for example as shown in Figure 2 
        where CE-3 is directly connected to a PE-Core.  
      
        The customer-facing Ethernet ports on PE-Edge and PE-core, when 
        connected directly to customer site, are called LPE endpoints. 
        These LPE endpoints can be logical when LPE supports customer 
        VLAN processing and represent the customer demarcation point 
        for VPLS service. 
      
        PE-Edges will interoperate with other PE-Edges in the same LPE 
        or different LPEs. PE-Edges connected to the same Switched 
        Ethernet Transport can inter-operate without involvement of a

        PE-Core. A network consists of only PE-Edges can deliver a 
        subset of VPLS services. The PE-Cores provide intermediary 
        functions to enable PE-Edges to interoperate with PEs outside 
        their local Switched Ethernet Transport domain. PE-Cores can 
        also offer VPLS services to CEs directly connected to PE-Core 
        and can also communicate with conventional PE devices that 
        implement VPLS functions on a single device. PE-Cores are 
        connected in a fully mesh topology of transport tunnels across 
        the core network. 
         
        PE-Edges are only aware of PE-Cores and other PE-Edges in the
        same-switched Ethernet transport domain; therefore there is no 
        direct full mesh signaling between PE-Edges across the core 
        network. Any inter-site connectivity between PE-Edges across 
        different switched Ethernet transport domains traverses the PE-
        Cores.  
         
         
     4.2 LPE Functional Elements  
      
        Following sections describe a list of PE functions that can 
        allow the distribution of functions described in Section 2.3 in 
        forming a LPE:           
      
      
     4.2.1 LPE VPLS Configurations  
         
        An LPE-based VPLS service can be created either at the PE-Edge 
        or the PE-Core or both. It is also possible to use a service 
        provider network management system to provide these 
        configurations. A VPLS solution is a port-based VPN type 
        architecture. Therefore, configuring LPE endpoints, physical or 
        logical customer-facing ports defined in Section 4.1, and 
        associating these LPE endpoints to VPLS membership scheme 
        accomplishes the VPLS membership.   
         
        It may happen that a different membership scheme is used for 
        intra-LPE than the membership scheme used for inter-LPE. In 
        this case a mapping function is needed at LPE level to maintain 
        unique VPLS membership across the service provider network. 
      
         
     4.2.2 LPE VPLS Auto-discovery 
         
        A lightweight protocol similar to [LPE-AD] is recommended 
        between PE-Edge and PE-Core to exchange VPLS related 
        information e.g. membership, tunneling, encapsulation schemes 
        etc. for the purpose of auto-discovery of LPE endpoints 
        belonging to the same VPLS. Example of functions provided by an 
        [LPE-AD] include:

        o Notification of LPE endpoint Addition, Deletion, and 
        Modification within any VPLS.  
        o Service Label/Tunnel information exchange within any LPE.  
        o Addition/Deletion/Modification of PE-Edge devices. 
         
      
         
     4.2.3 LPE VPLS Topology and Loop Prevention  
         
        LPE is quite flexible and various network configurations can be 
        implemented, some of them being: 
         
        - PE-Edges and PE-Cores implemented within a single device 
        - PE-Edge connected directly to PE-core devices through 
          physical links 
        - PE-Edge connected to PE-Core through virtual point-to-point 
          link (e.g. FR, ATM).  
        - Multiple Broadcast/Switched Ethernet Transport domains 
         
         
        When implemented within a single PE device, LPE behaves similar 
        to conventional VPLS solutions that exhibit scaling and 
        reliability constraints. 
         
        PE-Edges can be directly connected to PE-Cores via Ethernet 
        trunks. When the same PE-Edge is connected to same PE-Core via 
        more than one Ethernet trunk, it introduces reliability, as 
        discussed in Section 4.2.6, and potential for load sharing. 
         
        PE-Edges and PE-cores can also be connected via multiple 
        broadcast or Switched Ethernet Transport domains e.g. Resilient 
        Packet Rings (RPR). In such cases, Ethernet header can be used 
        as a form of transport header between PE-Edge and PE-Core 
        devices. This connectivity offers specific advantages e.g. 
        provide direct PE-Edge-to-PE-Edge connectivity on the same 
        Switched Ethernet Transport domain without requiring PE-Core.  
         
        Provider VPLS network can participate in customer STP to avoid 
        loops in the customer network for multi-homed customers or 
        customers with backdoor connectivity. This is an OPTIONAL 
        function.  
         
         
     4.2.4 LPE VPLS MAC Learning  
         
        The logical PE can be built with a PE-Core with or without 
        source MAC learning capabilities. A PE-Core needs to perform 
        source MAC learning in situations where VPLS customer sites are 
        attached to the PE-Core. However, when no customer sites are 
        attached to a PE-Core, the LPE will perform MAC learning 
        function only at the PE-Edge level.

     4.2.5 LPE Customer Packet Encapsulation 
      
        Within the LPE, the Ethernet frame encapsulation scheme can be 
        different than the Ethernet frame encapsulation scheme across 
        the IP/MPLS core network infrastructure. In such a case, the PE-
        Core carries out the translation/mapping between LPE 
        encapsulation scheme to the core encapsulation scheme.   
         
         
     4.2.6 LPE Service Label De-multiplexing 
         
        De-multiplexing header can used to identify the VPLS service 
        within a transport tunnel. Mechanisms analogous to the "VC 
        label" stated in [MARTINI-ENCAPS] can be used. 
         
        Typically a VPLS is associated with a VPN-ID, which uniquely 
        identifies the VPLS across the service provider network. An 
        example of VPN-ID format can be found in [RFC-2685]. This draft 
        doesn't preclude the use of other schemes for VPLS membership as 
        those used in layer-3 and optical VPNs (e.g., route-target 
        schemes). 
         
         
     4.2.7 LPE VPLS Resiliency 
         
        To be able to offer resiliency along the access of the VPLS 
        service network, it is preferable to implement the service 
        using clusters of service elements. This helps to prevent 
        single failures from disrupting large-scale services. LPE-based 
        access network are more tightly coupled than PE-based access 
        networks due to additional signaling required when formulating 
        the LPE. 
          
        Within the logical PE, failures can appear at the PE-Edge, PE-
        Core, the PE-Edge/PE-Core interconnecting link or switched 
        Ethernet network. Dual PE-Cores can be used to protect the LPE 
        failure and VPLS failures. When using more than one PE-Core, 
        one will need mechanisms to blend those PE-Cores into LPE.  
         
        When PE-Edges are directly connected to PE-Cores via multiple 
        Ethernet trunks, where the PE-Core connected via multiple 
        trunks can be used for load sharing and for recovery from link 
        and device failures.  
         
         
     4.2.8 LPE VPLS QoS 
         
        Intra-LPE or inter PE-Core connectivity can be traffic 
        engineered. RSVP-TE/CR-LDP can be used at the core and/or 
        switched Ethernet transport. Customer traffic can be policed 
        and shaped at the access port on the PE-Edge. The customer

        traffic is classified on the PE-Edge, and is mapped onto the 
        endpoints VC-Labels. Most generally priority configured per 
        access port (at the PE-Edge level) maps the customer 802.1p 
        traffic to the network priority tunneling. This mapping is 
        based on customer VPLS SLA. 
      
        Function includes ingress classification, metering, policing, 
        and egress shaping of customer traffic at the provider 
        boundary. 
      
      
     5. LPE VPLS Reference Model  
         
        VPLS customers typically connect to providerÆs VPLS aware 
        devices, which could be fully functional PE devices just like 
        any other layer 2 scheme, or low-cost edge Ethernet devices. 
        These edge devices could be themselves attached to either 
        switched Ethernet networks or through uplinks to other provider 
        edge devices, which are attached to a packet switched core 
        IP/MPLS network infrastructure. In the example illustrated in 
        Figure 3, from a conceptual view, PEs facing customer equipment 
        (and not attached to the core network) combined with PE 
        attached to the core network represent a "logical PE" construct 
        where many VPLSs along with other layer-2 and layer-3 VPN 
        services can be offered.

        To highlight the case described in Figure 3, we label each PE 
        within the network as a PE-Edge or PE-Core depending if the PE 
        is attached to the core network or not (and depending if there 
        is a functional relationship between the PE-Edge and the PE-
        Core). PEs who do not participate in these schemes are not 
        labeled. Using Figure 3, PE1, PE7, PE5, PE6 can be labeled PE-
        Edges while PE2, PE3, PE4, and PE8 are labeled PE-Cores. 
         
        Within the LPE reference model, a CE can be attached to one or 
        more than one PE-Edges. However, connecting to more than one 
        PE-Edge may require the PE-Edges to participate in customer 
        spanning tree protocol. 
         
        PE-Edges can be connected through the Switched Ethernet 
        transport network or direct links to one (or more) PE-Core(s). 
         
        There can be multiple switched Ethernet transport domains within 
        a Logical PE. A Switched Ethernet transport domain is equivalent 
        to a broadcast domain. All the devices within the switched 
        Ethernet transport domain will receive an Ethernet broadcast 
        message sent onto the switched Ethernet transport domain. Within 
        a carrierÆs metro Ethernet network it can contain multiple 
        Switched Ethernet Transport domains. For example, a particular 
        802.1q VLAN in a carrierÆs metro Ethernet network is a switched 
        Ethernet transport domain. Most likely PE-Cores are highly 
        scalable routers/Ethernet switches (with IP/MPLS based 
        capabilities). PE-Cores like any other PEs can provide VPLS, 
        layer-2, and layer-3 VPN services - PE-Cores are connected to 
        each other over core network (e.g. MPLS) through P devices as 
        usual VPN architectures [PPVPN-REQ]. 
      
        Logical PE concept can be used in situations requiring high 
        scalability in terms of number of VPLSs and port density while 
        aiming towards reusing low-cost PE devices. LPE can also be 
        used in situations where the provider PEs don't have equal 
        weight with respect to resource availability and full VPN 
        functionality supported.  
      
        Logical PE also allows a provider to gracefully introduce MPLS 
        functionality into their existing 802.1q or stacked Q-tag 
        Ethernet network. One migration path is that the existing 
        customer facing devices will evolve into PE-Edges devices. These 
        PE-Edge devices need not be MPLS aware and can remain simple 
        from the control plane side. PE-Edge-to-PE-Edge communication 
        can continue to be carried over the existing switched Ethernet 
        transport network. PE-Core can then be added into the switched 
        Ethernet transport network to provide connectivity to the 
        IP/MPLS core. The grouping of PE-Core, PE-Edge, and switched 
        Ethernet transport devices can give the appearance of a PE from 
        other PEs across the IP/MPLS core.

     6. LPE Functional Distribution Example 
         
        Distribution of Logical PE functions is primarily determined 
        upon the VPLS architecture model used. This section discusses 
        one such possible distribution of these LPE functions.   
         
        In most cases, the PE-Edges provide such functions as managing 
        the SLA including bandwidth policing, traffic classification 
        and QoS, as well as customer Ethernet frame encapsulation, and 
        MAC and VLAN learning. While, in most cases, the PE-Core 
        maintains membership information and performs VPN membership 
        determination and advertisement to all the PE-Cores members of 
        the same VPLS. 
           
        By using a signaling and/or an auto-discovery mechanism, the 
        PE-Core distributes the VPN and/or LPE endpoint related 
        information to all PEs/LPEs across the core. Such distribution 
        can be constrained to only the PEs/LPEs that have VPLS 
        membership in common. 
         
         
     6.1 PE-Edge Functions  
         
        Typically a PE-Edge, being a bridge, a routing switch, or a 
        router, will perform regular Ethernet based functions. These 
        functions are: 
         
        o MAC learning  
        o Packet Replication/Flooding 
        o Loop Prevention [e.g. participation in customer SPT](OPTIONAL) 
        o Transport tunnel within LPE 
        o Service label de-multiplexing within LPE 
        o Auto-discovery within LPE [e.g. [LPE-AD]] 
        o Customer traffic prioritizing, policing, and shaping  
        o Customer VLAN processing 
        o Packet Encapsulation 
        o VPLS configuration (depending on the configuration model)  
      
         
     6.2 PE-Core Functions 
      
        A PE-Core being attached to an IP/MPLS network and providing 
        other VPN service than just VPLS should provide the following 
        functions: 
         
        o Packet Replication/Flooding 
        o Transport tunnel within LPE  
        o Service label de-multiplexing within LPE 
        o Auto-discovery within LPE [e.g. [LPE-AD]] 
        o VPLS Configuration (depending on the configuration model) 
        o VPLS Auto-discovery between PEs

        o Transport tunnel signaling   
        o Service Label signaling between PEs 
        o Service Label de-multiplexing between PEs 
        o VPN Membership mapping from within LPE domain to core domain 
        (OPTIONAL) 
      
      
     7. Security Considerations 
      
        VPLS security needs to be considered within the LPE and inter-
        LPEs.  
         
        Within the LPE, Customer traffic needs to be separated. 
        Ethernet Qtag, MPLS/IP based tunneling can be used for customer 
        VPLS traffic separation. The level of data path security is 
        same as ATM or FR networks. This document does not preclude the 
        use of encryption mechanisms within the LPE (although not 
        recommended, particularly if Ethernet switched transport is 
        used). 
      
        Inter-LPE security is provided within the layer-2 VPN 
        architecture. A range of security parameters can be used, from 
        using link layer type security to full encryption and 
        authentication. An inter-domain solution usually requires some 
        security mechanism across provider boundaries. For full inter-
        provider security (only when needed), IPSec tunneling mechanism 
        is recommended.
