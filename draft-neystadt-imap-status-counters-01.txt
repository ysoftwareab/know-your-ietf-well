 1. Abstract 
     
    The STATUS-COUNTERS extends IMAP4rev1Ës STATUS command. This 
    extension adds the following functionality: 
     
    Enable MUA to get mailbox counters per groups of messages, grouped 
    according to the value of Message-Context header field. For 
    example, the MUA can find out that the Inbox contains 5 unseen fax 
    messages.

 3. Introduction and Overview 
     
    [IMAP4] defines the STATUS command that allows a Mail User Agent 
    (MUA) to query status of a mailbox on the server. [UM-ISSUES] 
    outlines a number of additional requirements that are beyond 
    abilities of the standard STATUS command. Some extracts from these 
    requirements are listed below.  
     
    [UM-ISSUES] 2.2.1 Mailbox Summary (Per-context counters in mailbox 
    STATUS command): 
     
    The common TUI (Telephony User Interface) prompt "you have two new 
    voice messages, six unheard messages, and one new fax message" 
    requires more information than is made available by IMAP STATUS 
    command. The STATUS command provides only a count of new and total 
    messages and doesn't allow to extract standardized attributes from 
    message headers. Without an extension to the STATUS command, in 
    order to get any aggregate information about message types, a 
    client has to open the mailbox with SELECT/EXAMINE and then either 
    perform FETCH or one or more SEARCHes. Both scenarios are 
    computationally expensive on the server and may generate 
    unnecessary traffic. 
     
    The STATUS-COUNTERS IMAP extension proposed in this document 
    extends the STATUS command to return number of messages having an 
    arbitrary IMAP flag set as well as belonging to a particular 
    message-context class. A single extended STATUS command will be

                 IMAP4 rev1 - STATUS-COUNTERS Extension       June 2002 
  
  
    able to extract enough data to count messages in various 
    categories. 
     
    A server supporting this extension MAY extract all the information 
    required to fulfil a particular client request on every request, 
    however for an adequate performance it is RECOMMENDED that the 
    server implements one of the following: 
     
    - an agent performing a message injection into the message store 
    (MDA or IMAP server in the injection is done via IMAP APPEND) 
    should parse the message and create indexes for the necessary 
    information; 
    - IMAP server should parse and cache the necessary information 
    after the first request.  
     
    STATUS-COUNTERS relies on a special support of $Important keyword 
    defined in [IMAP-KEYWORDS] by the IMAP server. In particular, the 
    server MUST automatically set $Important flag on injection of an 
    "important" message as described in [IMAP-KEYWORDS]. 
     
  
 4. Conventions Used in this Document 
     
    In examples, "C:" and "S:" indicate lines sent by the client and 
    server respectively. 
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", and "MAY" 
    in this document are to be interpreted as defined in "Key words for 
    use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels" [KEYWORDS]. 
     
    Space character may be represented in examples as "<SPACE>". 
     
     
 5. Features 
  
 5.1 CAPABILITY 
     
    The STATUS-COUNTERS extension is implemented by any IMAP4 server 
    returning "STATUS-COUNTERS" as one of the supported capabilities to 
    the CAPABILITY command.  If the server does not advertise the 
    STATUS-COUNTERS capability, the client MUST NOT use the STATUS-
    COUNTERS extension and continue to operate with multiple old STATUS 
    commands and FETCHes or SEARCHes as specified in the base IMAP 
    specification (see section 7.2 for some examples). 
     
 5.2 STATUS command 
     
    The existing [IMAP4] STATUS command is extended.  
     

  
  
 Neystadt               Expires - December 2002               [Page 3] 
                 IMAP4 rev1 - STATUS-COUNTERS Extension       June 2002 
  
  
    A new meta-data item named COUNTERS is added to the existing STATUS 
    data items.  
     
       COUNTERS       (list of counter names (or "attributes")) 
     
    This will provide client with different numeric summaries of 
    messages grouped according to the value of Message-Context header 
    field. The empty list specifies that only the total number of 
    messages in a group should be returned. 
     
    If COUNTERS status data item was specified in the STATUS command, 
    the untagged STATUS response code must contain COUNTERS data item. 
     
    Response to COUNTERS request can be slow, since some server 
    implementations may need to go over whole mailbox and process all 
    message headers in order to calculate counters. 
     
    Example: 
     
       C:    A CAPABILITY 
       S:    * CAPABILITY ... IMAP4rev1 STATUS-COUNTERS ...  
       S:    A OK CAPABILITY 
          ... 
       C:    B STATUS Inbox (UIDNEXT UIDVALIDITY 
                COUNTERS (\Seen $Important "Unseen-Important" \Recent))  
       S:    * STATUS Inbox (UIDNEXT 850 UIDVALIDITY 1234 
                COUNTERS (All (100 \Seen 30 $Important 20<SPACE> 
                         "Unseen-Important" 10 \Recent 5)<SPACE> 
                      "Voice-Message" (10 \Seen 3 $Important 2<SPACE> 
                            "Unseen-Important" 1 \Recent 5)<SPACE> 
                      "Fax-Message" (10 \Seen 3 $Important 2<SPACE> 
                            "Unseen-Important" 1 \Recent 5))) 
       S:    B OK STATUS completed. 
     
     
 5.3 COUNTERS response 
     
    Contents:   parenthesized list messages groups (by Message-Context) 
                each one including parenthesized list of counters 
     
    COUNTERS response list is of the following form: 
     
       (Group1 (Total Attrib1 Value Attrib2 Value) Group2 (...) ...) 
     
    Message-Context class of a message is determined by inspecting the 
    Message-Context header field of the message and extracting its 
    value. Group name is either a Message-Context class as defined in 
    [Message-Context] (e.g. "Voice-Message" or "Fax-Message") or a 
    special tag ALL. ALL is used to indicate aggregated counters of all

                 IMAP4 rev1 - STATUS-COUNTERS Extension       June 2002 
  
  
    messages, ignoring Message-Context attribute. Also note, that 
    according to [Message-Context] all messages without Message-Context 
    header MUST be treated as if they have a Message-Context header 
    with the value of "none". Comparison on Message-Context values MUST 
    be case insensitive as per [Message-Context]. 
     
    If messages of a particular Message-Context class are not present 
    in the mailbox, the information for this class is not included in 
    COUNTERS response list (for example, the IMAP example in the 
    previous sections suggests that there are no SMS messages in the 
    mailbox).  
     
    Valid group attributes are COUNTERS STATUS data items. Here are the 
    details of the counters: 
     
    Any IMAP Flag        Number of messages with given IMAP flag set 
                         per given Message-Context class (or All). For 
                         example, $Important or \Deleted.  
     
    "Unseen-Important"   Number of messages per given Message-Context 
                         class (or All) that have the $Important 
                         keyword set and don't have the \Seen flag set. 
     
    This extension allows IMAP server to implement additional 
    attributes and provide it per message-context (i.e. "X-My-Special-
    Counter") 
     
    See previous section for the example of COUNTERS response. 
     
     
 6. Implementation Guidelines 
     
 6.1 Server Issues 
     
    Since in order to calculate message counters, the MIME headers of 
    the messages are inspected, this calculation can consume 
    significant amount of processing time. It is recommended for server 
    implementations to generate the counters during the injection of 
    the message (in MDA) or persistently cache them after they are 
    calculated for the first time. 
     
    It is expected that MUAs, in order to display to the user the 
    important or unseen messages, will query all subscribed mailboxes 
    for several counters during every login. Thus it is recommended 
    that the counters are cached permanently in the mailbox and their 
    retrieval should be fast.

                 IMAP4 rev1 - STATUS-COUNTERS Extension       June 2002 
  
  
     
    Contraversaly to [IMAP-KEYWORDS], server supporting STATUS-COUNTERS 
    MUST be able to auto-set $Important falg on every injected 
    Ÿimportant÷ message. 
     
    In order to satisfy the last MUST requirement a mail server MAY do 
    one of the following: 
     
    1. Set the $Important flag in [every] delivery agent using 
       implementation specific delivery API. If the delivery agent is 
       an IMAP client, it should specify the $Important keyword in 
       APPEND command. 
     
    2. Set the $Important flag using Sieve script, if the mail server 
       supports Sieve and the Sieve extension for setting IMAP flags. 
       When message is added to mailbox using APPEND, IMAP server 
       should parse it and turn on the flag. 
  
    3. Implement the logic for setting $Important flag when message is 
       accessed first time by a MUA and persist this flag. 
     
 6.2 Client Issues 
     
    If an IMAP server implementation does not support this command, its 
    logic can be achieved by one of the following algorithms: 
     
    A. For a given mailbox do: 
     
       1. a SELECT mailbox 
       2. b FETCH 1:* (BODY[HEADER (Message-Context)] FLAGS) 
       3. Calculate the counters from FETCH responses. 
     
    or 
      
    B. For a given mailbox do: 
     
       1. a SELECT mailbox 
       2. b SEARCH HEADER "Message-Context" "Voice-Message" 
              Construct message set <b> from the result; if <b> is 
              empty, skip till step 5.  
       3. c SEARCH <b> UNSEEN. 
              Construct message set <c> from the result (<c> is the 
              list of all unseen voice messages); if <c> is empty, skip 
              till step 5. 
       4. d SEARCH <c> KEYWORD $Important. 
              Result is the list of all important unseen voice 
              messages; 
       5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each message class the client is 
          interested in

                 IMAP4 rev1 - STATUS-COUNTERS Extension       June 2002 
  
  
       6. Calculate the counters from SEARCH responses. 
     
    Scenario A may generate a lot of traffic for large mailboxes. 
    Scenario B is more computationally expensive for the server than 
    scenario A, but generates less traffic. 
     
    Note that for scenario B, there is no way for MUA to learn about 
    available Message-Contexts, as it is expected it will have to have 
    this knowledge as part of its user-interface. 
     
    It is expected that MUAs will need to request STATUS-COUNTERS for 
    all mailboxes it is interested in in order to generate a list to 
    display. MUA should not request STATUS-COUNTERS for all mailboxes 
    on the server, since the number of accessible mailboxes can be 
    extremely large. Instead MUAs should request STATUS-COUNTERS only 
    for mailboxes that would fit on a single screen or for all 
    mailboxes the user is subscribed to (the latter may be obtained 
    with LSUB). 
     
     
 7. Formal Syntax 
     
    The following syntax specification uses the Augmented Backus-Naur 
    Form (ABNF) notation as specified in [ABNF]. 
     
    Non-terminals referenced but not defined below are as defined by 
    [IMAP4]. 
     
    Except as noted otherwise, all alphabetic characters are case-
    insensitive. The use of upper or lower case characters to define 
    token strings is for editorial clarity only.  Implementations MUST 
    accept these strings in a case-insensitive fashion. 
     
      status        = "STATUS" SP mailbox SP "(" status-att-ext  
                         *(SP status-att-ext) ")" 
                         ;; redefine STATUS command syntax defined in 
                         ;;[IMAP4] 
       
      status-att-ext  = status-att / status-req-cnt 
                        ;; status-att is defined in [IMAP4] 
       
      status-req-cnt  = "COUNTERS" SP "(" [counter-type  
                        *(SP counter-type)] ")" 
       
      mailbox-data    =/ "STATUS" SP mailbox SP "(" 
                         [status-rsp-info *(SP status-rsp-info)] ")" / 
       
      status-rsp-info = status-rsp-std / status-rsp-cnt

      status-rsp-cnt  = "COUNTERS" SP "(" sts-rsp-cnt-grp  
                        *(SP sts-rsp-cnt-grp) ")" 
       
      sts-rsp-cnt-grp = msg-ctx-cls-all SP "(" total-value  
                        *(SP counter-value) ")"

                        ;; counter type with the associated value for 
                        ;; the corresponding Message-Context class

                        ;; [Message-Context] 
     
     
 8. Security Considerations  
     
    There is a potential inconsistency that may be introduced by server 
    between actual messages in the mailboxes and information reported 
    by STATUS-COUNTERS. This can happen if the server reports 
    inaccurate information. User Agents must not blindly rely on the 
    correspondence between STATUS-COUNTERS and messages themselves. 
     
    It can be resource consuming for some server implementations to 
    handle STATUS-COUNTERS command with a mailbox with many messages. 
    This can potentially facilitate a "Deny of Service" attack. It is 
    recommended for servers to implement artificial delay between two 
    subsequent STATUS-COUNTERS commands with a very short delay between 
    them.

 11. Change Log 
     
    00 Initial Revision. 
    01 - Added support for generic IMAP flag counting. 
        - Removed Importance, since it now relies on $Important flag 
        from [IMAP-KEYWORDS]. 
        - Implemented various comments received from the imap list 
        regarding implementation options. 
        - Added ABNF. 
        - Major wording improvements.

 12. Open Issues for Discussion 
     
    - Currently there is no way to request counters of per only 
    specific message context. If MUA requests new "COUNTERS" data item 
    it will get them all. This can be wasteful on large amount of 
    folders. On other hand this would complicate the command 
    furthermore. If somebody thinks this must be added, please say so. 
     
    - Should EXAMINE and SELECT include COUNTERS untagged response as 
    well? (Probably not) 
     
    - Is it useful to request just counters without grouping my message
