Abstract 
    
   This document describes the representation of a session 
   authorization policy element for supporting policy-based per-session 
   authorization and admission control.  The goal of session 
   authorization is to allow the exchange of information between 
   network elements in order to authorize the use of resources for a 
   service and to co-ordinate actions between the signaling and 
   transport planes.  This document describes how a process on a system 
   authorizes the reservation of resources by a host and then provides 
   that host with a session authorization policy element which can be 
   inserted into a resource reservation protocol (e.g. the RSVP PATH 
   message) to facilitate proper and secure reservation of those 
   resources within the network. We describe the encoding of session
   authorization information as a policy element conforming to the 
   format of a Policy Data object (RFC-2750) and provide details 
   relating to operations, processing rules and error scenarios.

2. Introduction 
    
   RSVP [RFC-2205] is one example of a resource reservation protocol 
   that is used by a host to request specific services from the network 
   for particular application data streams or flows.  RSVP requests 
   will generally result in resources being reserved in each router 
   along the data path.  RSVP allows users to obtain preferential 
   access to network resources, under the control of an admission 
   control mechanism.  Such admission control is often based on user or 
   application identity [RFC-3182], however, it is also valuable to 
   provide the ability for per-session admission control. 
    
   In order to allow for per-session admission control, it is necessary 
   to provide a mechanism for ensuring use of resources by a host has 
   been properly authorized before allowing the reservation of those 
   resources.  In order to meet this requirement, there must be 
   information in the resource reservation message which may be used to 
   verify the validity of the reservation request.  This can be done by 
   providing the host with a session authorization policy element which 
   is inserted into the resource reservation message and verified by 
   the network. 
    
   This document describes the session authorization policy element 
   (AUTH_SESSION) used to convey information about the resources 
   authorized for use by a session.  The host must obtain an 
   AUTH_SESSION element from an authorizing entity via a session 
   signaling protocol such as SIP [RFC-3261].  The host then inserts 
   the AUTH_SESSION element into the resource reservation message to 
   allow verification of the network resource request; in the case of 
   RSVP, this element MUST be encapsulated in the Policy Data object 
   [RFC-2750] of an RSVP PATH message. Network elements verify the 
   request and then process the resource reservation message based on 
   admission policy. 
    
   [S-AUTH] describes a framework in which a session authorization 
   policy element may be utilized to contain information relevant to 
   the network's decision to grant a reservation request.

3. Policy Element for Session Authorization  
    
3.1 Policy Data Object Format 
    
   The Session Authorization policy element conforms to the format of a 
   POLICY DATA object which contains policy information and is carried 
   by policy based admission protocols such as RSVP. A detailed 
   description of the POLICY_DATA object can be found in "RSVP 
   Extensions for Policy Control" [RFC-2750]. 
    
3.2 Session Authorization Policy Element 
    
   In this section we describe a policy element (PE) called session 
   authorization (AUTH_SESSION).  The AUTH_SESSION policy element 
   contains a list of fields which describe the session, along with 
   other attributes. 
    
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
          | Length                    | P-Type = AUTH_SESSION     | 
          +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+ 
          // Session Authorization Attribute List                // 
          +-------------------------------------------------------+ 
       
   Length: 16 bits  
      The length of the policy element (including the Length and 
      P-Type) is in number of octets (MUST be in multiples of 4) and 
      indicates the end of the session authorization information block. 
    
   P-Type: 16 bits (Session Authorization Type) 
      AUTH_SESSION = TBD-by-IANA 
      The Policy element type (P-type) of this element.  The 
      Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry 
      for policy element types for identity as described in 
      [RFC-2750].   
    
   Session Authorization Attribute List: variable length 
      The session authorization attribute list is a collection of 
      objects which describes the session and provides other 
      information necessary to verify the resource reservation request. 
      An initial set of valid objects is described in Section 3.3. 
    
3.3 Session Authorization Attributes 
    
   A session authorization attribute may contain a variety of 
   information and has both an attribute type and subtype.  The 
   attribute itself MUST be a multiple of 4 octets in length, and any 
   attributes that are not a multiple of 4 octets long MUST be padded 
   to a 4-octet boundary. All padding bytes MUST have a value of zero. 
    
    
    
 
Hamer, et al.                                                   [Page 4] 

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002 
                                     
 
    
      +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
      | Length          | S-Type |SubType | 
      +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
      | Value ... 
      +--------+--------+--------+--------+ 
    
    
   Length: 16 bits
        The length field is two octets and indicates the actual length 
        of the attribute (including Length, S-Type and SubType fields)  
        in number of octets.  The length does NOT include any bytes  
        padding to the value field to make the attribute a multiple of  
        4 octets long.  
    
   S-Type: 8 bits 
        Session authorization attribute type (S-Type) field is one 
        octet.  IANA acts as a registry for S-Types as described 
        in section 7, IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry 
        contains the following S-Types: 
    
        1  AUTH_ENT_ID          The unique identifier of the entity 
                                which authorized the session. 
                                        
        2  SESSION_ID           Unique identifier for this session. 
    
        3  SOURCE_ADDR          Address specification for the 
                                session originator. 
    
        4  DEST_ADDR            Address specification for the 
                                session end-point. 
    
        5  START_TIME           The starting time for the session. 
    
        6  END_TIME             The end time for the session. 
    
        7  RESOURCES            The resources which the user is 
                                authorized to request. 
    
        8  AUTHENTICATION_DATA  Authentication data of the session 
                                authorization policy element. 
    
   SubType: 8 bits    
        Session authorization attribute sub-type is one octet in 
        length.  The value of the SubType depends on the S-Type. 
    
   Value: variable length 
        The attribute specific information.

3.3.1 Authorizing Entity Identifier 
    
   AUTH_ENT_ID is used to identify the entity which authorized the 
   initial service request and generated the session authorization 
   policy element.  The AUTH_ENT_ID may be represented in various 
   formats, and the SubType is used to define the format for the ID. 
   The format for AUTH_ENT_ID is as follows: 
    
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | Length        |S-Type |SubType| 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | OctetString ... 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
    
   Length  
      Length of the attribute, which MUST be > 4. 
    
   S-Type 
      AUTH_ENT_ID 
    
   SubType 
      The following sub-types for AUTH_ENT_ID are defined.  IANA 
      acts as a registry for AUTH_ENT_ID sub-types as described 
      in section 7, IANA Considerations.  Initially, the registry 
      contains the following sub-types of AUTH_ENT_ID: 
    
      1  IPV4_ADDRESS        IPv4 address represented in 32 bits 
    
      2  IPV6_ADDRESS        IPv6 address represented in 128 bits 
    
      3  FQDN                Fully Qualified Domain Name as defined 
                             in RFC-1034 as an ASCII string. 
    
      4  ASCII_DN            X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as an ASCII string. 
    
      5  UNICODE_DN          X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as a UTF-8 string. 
            
      6  URI                 Universal Resource Identifier, as  
                             defined in RFC-2396. 
    
      7  KRB_PRINCIPAL       Fully Qualified Kerberos Principal name 
                             represented by the ASCII string of a 
                             principal followed by the @ realm name as 
                             defined in RFC-1510 (e.g. 
                             principalX@realmY). 
    
      8  X509_V3_CERT        A chain of authorizing entity's X.509 V3  
                             digital certificates as defined in RFC-   
                             3280.

      9  PGP_CERT            The PGP digital certificate of the 
                             authorizing entity as defined in RFC-2440. 
    
    
   OctetString 
      Contains the authorizing entity identifier. 
    
3.3.2 Session Identifier 
    
   SESSION_ID is a unique identifier used by the authorizing entity to 
   identify the request.  It may be used for a number of purposes, 
   including replay detection, or to correlate this request to a policy 
   decision entry made by the authorizing entity. For example, the 
   SESSION_ID can be based on simple sequence number or on a standard 
   NTP timestamp.  
    
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | Length        |S-Type |SubType| 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | OctetString ... 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
    
   Length 
      Length of the attribute, which MUST be > 4. 
          
       
   S-Type 
      SESSION_ID 
    
   SubType 
      No subtypes for SESSION ID are currently defined; this field MUST 
   be set to zero. The authorizing entity is the only network entity 
   that needs to interpret the contents of the SESSION ID therefore the 
   contents and format are implementation dependent. 
    
   OctetString 
      Contains the session identifier. 
    
3.3.3 Source Address 
    
   SOURCE_ADDR is used to identify the source address specification of 
   the authorized session. This S-Type may be useful in some scenarios 
   to make sure the resource request has been authorized for that 
   particular source address and/or port. 
    
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | Length        |S-Type |SubType| 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+ 
      | OctetString ... 
      +-------+-------+-------+-------+

   Length 
      Length of the attribute, which MUST be > 4. 
    
   S-Type 
      SOURCE_ADDR 
    
   SubType 
      The following sub types for SOURCE_ADDR are defined. IANA 
      acts as a registry for SOURCE_ADDR sub-types as 
      described in section 7, IANA Considerations. Initially, the 
      registry contains the following sub types for SOURCE_ADDR: 
    
      1  IPV4_ADDRESS        IPv4 address represented in 32 bits 
    
      2  IPV6_ADDRESS        IPv6 address represented in 128 bits 
    
      3  FQDN                Fully Qualified Domain Name as defined 
                             in RFC-1034 as an ASCII string. 
    
      4  ASCII_DN            X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as an ASCII string. 
    
      5  UNICODE_DN          X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as a UTF-8 string. 
    
      6  UDP_PORT_LIST       list of UDP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry. 
            
      7  TCP_PORT_LIST       list of TCP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry. 
    
   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the source address information. 
    
   In scenarios where a source address is required (see Section 5), at 
   least one of the subtypes 1 through 5 (inclusive) MUST be included 
   in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element. Multiple SOURCE 
   ADDR attributes MAY be included if multiple addresses have been 
   authorized. The source address field of the resource reservation 
   datagram (e.g. RSVP PATH) MUST match one of the SOURCE ADDR 
   attributes contained in this Session Authorization Data Policy 
   Element when resolved to an IP address. 
    
   At most, one instance of subtype 6 MAY be included in every Session 
   Authorization Data Policy Element. At most, one instance of subtype 
   7 MAY be included in every Session Authorization Data Policy 
   Element. Inclusion of a subtype 6 attribute does not prevent 
   inclusion of a subtype 7 attribute (i.e. both UDP and TCP ports may 
   be authorized).

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002 
                                     
 
   If no PORT attributes are specified, then all ports are considered 
   valid; otherwise, only the specified ports are authorized for use. 
 
   Every source address and port list must be included in a separate 
   SOURCE_ADDR attribute. 
    
3.3.4 Destination Address 
    
   DEST_ADDR is used to identify the destination address of the 
   authorized session. This S-Type may be useful in some scenarios to 
   make sure the resource request has been authorized for that 
   particular destination address and/or port.

      DEST_ADDR 
    
   SubType 
      The following sub types for DEST_ADDR are defined. IANA  
      acts as a registry for DEST_ADDR sub-types as described in 
      section 7, IANA Considerations. Initially, the registry 
      contains the following sub types for DEST_ADDR: 
    
      1  IPV4_ADDRESS        IPv4 address represented in 32 bits 
    
      2  IPV6_ADDRESS        IPv6 address represented in 128 bits 
    
      3  FQDN                Fully Qualified Domain Name as defined 
                             in RFC-1034 as an ASCII string. 
    
      4  ASCII_DN            X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as an ASCII string. 
    
      5  UNICODE_DN          X.500 Distinguished name as defined  
                             in RFC-2253 as a UTF-8 string. 
    
      6  UDP_PORT_LIST       list of UDP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry.  
            
      7  TCP_PORT_LIST       list of TCP port specifications, 
                             represented as 16 bits per list entry.

   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the destination address specification. 
    
   In scenarios where a destination address is required (see Section 
   5), at least one of the subtypes 1 through 5 (inclusive) MUST be 
   included in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element. 
   Multiple DEST ADDR attributes MAY be included if multiple addresses 
   have been authorized. The destination address field of the resource 
   reservation datagram (e.g. RSVP PATH) MUST match one of the DEST 
   ADDR attributes contained in this Session Authorization Data Policy 
   Element when resolved to an IP address. 
    
   At most, one instance of subtype 6 MAY be included in every Session 
   Authorization Data Policy Element. At most, one instance of subtype 
   7 MAY be included in every Session Authorization Data Policy 
   Element. Inclusion of a subtype 6 attribute does not prevent 
   inclusion of a subtype 7 attribute (i.e. both UDP and TCP ports may 
   be authorized). 
    
   If no PORT attributes are specified, then all ports are considered 
   valid; otherwise, only the specified ports are authorized for use. 
 
   Every destination address and port list must be included in a 
   separate DEST_ADDR attribute. 
    
    
3.3.5 Start time 
    
   START_TIME is used to identify the start time of the authorized 
   Session and can be used to prevent replay attacks. If the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element is presented in a resource request, the 
   network SHOULD reject the request if it is not received within a few 
   seconds of the start time specified.

   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the start time. 
    
3.3.6 End time 
    
   END_TIME is used to identify the end time of the authorized 
   session and can be used to limit the amount of time that resources 
   are authorized for use (e.g. in prepaid session scenarios).

   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the end time.  
    
3.3.7 Resources Authorized 
    
   RESOURCES is used to define the characteristics of the authorized 
   session. This S-Type may be useful in some scenarios to specify the 
   specific resources authorized to ensure the request fits the 
   authorized specifications.

   SubType 
      The following sub-types for RESOURCES are defined. IANA  
      acts as a registry for RESOURCES sub-types as described in 
      section 7, IANA Considerations. Initially, the registry 
      contains the following sub types for RESOURCES: 
    
      1  BANDWIDTH     Maximum bandwidth (kbps) authorized. 
    
      2  FLOW_SPEC     Flow spec specification as defined in 
                       RFC-2205. 
    
      3  SDP           SDP Media Descriptor as defined in  
                       RFC-2327. 
    
      4  DSCP          Differentiated services codepoint as  
                       defined in RFC-2474.             
    
   OctetString 
      The OctetString contains the resources specification. 
    
   In scenarios where a resource specification is required (see Section 
   5), at least one of the subtypes 1 through 4 (inclusive) MUST be 
   included in every Session Authorization Data Policy Element. 
   Multiple RESOURCE attributes MAY be included if multiple types of 
   resources have been authorized (e.g. DSCP and BANDWIDTH). 
    
    
3.3.8 Authentication data 
    
   The AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute contains the authentication data 
   of the AUTH_SESSION policy element and signs all the data in the 
   policy element up to the AUTHENTICATION_DATA.  If the 
   AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute has been included in the AUTH_SESSION 
   policy element, it MUST be the last attribute in the list. The 
   algorithm used to compute the authentication data depends on the 
   AUTH_ENT_ID SubType field. See Section 4 entitled Integrity of the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element.   
    
   A summary of AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute format is described 
   below.

4. Integrity of the AUTH_SESSION policy element 
    
   This section describes how to ensure the integrity of the policy 
   element is preserved. 
    
4.1 Shared symmetric keys 
    
      In shared symmetric key environments, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of 
   subtypes: IPV4_ADDR, IPV6_ADDR, FQDN, ASCII_DN, UNICODE_DN or URI.  
   An example AUTH_SESSION policy element is shown below. 
    
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | P-type = AUTH_SESSION       |

      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      |AUTH DATA.    |     zero     | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (Authentication data) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
    
4.1.1 Operational Setting using shared symmetric keys 
    
   This assumes both the Authorizing Entity and the Network router/PDP 
   are provisioned with shared symmetric keys and with policies 
   detailing which algorithm to be used for computing the 
   authentication data along with the expected length of the 
   authentication data for that particular algorithm.  
    
   Key maintenance is outside the scope of this document, but 
   AUTH_SESSION implementations MUST at least provide the ability to 
   manually configure keys and their parameters locally. The key used 
   to produce the authentication data is identified by the AUTH_ENT_ID 

 
Hamer, et al.                                                  [Page 13] 

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002
                                     
 
   field. Each key must also be configured with lifetime parameters for 
   the time period within which it is valid as well as an associated 
   cryptographic algorithm parameter specifying the algorithm to be 
   used with the key. At a minimum, all AUTH_SESSION implementations 
   MUST support the HMAC-MD5-128 [RFC-2104][FRC-1321] cryptographic 
   algorithm for computing the authentication data. New algorithms may 
   be added by the IETF standards process. 
    
   It is good practice to regularly change keys. Keys MUST be 
   configurable such that their lifetimes overlap allowing smooth 
   transitions between keys. At the midpoint of the lifetime overlap 
   between two keys, senders should transition from using the current 
   key to the next/longer-lived key. Meanwhile, receivers simply accept 
   any identified key received within its configured lifetime and 
   reject those that are not. 
 
    
4.2 Kerberos 
    
   In a Kerberos environment, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of the subtype 
   KRB_PRINCIPAL. Kerberos [RFC 1510] authentication uses a trusted 
   third party (the Kerberos Distribution Center - KDC) to provide for 
   authentication of the AUTH_SESSION to a network server.  It is 
   assumed that a KDC is present and both host and verifier of 
   authentication information (authorizing entity and router/PDP) 
   implement Kerberos authentication. 
    
   An example of the Kerberos AUTH_DATA policy element is shown below. 
    
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | P-type = AUTH_SESSION       | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      |SESSION_ID    |     zero     | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (The session identifier) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | Length                      | AUTH_ENT_ID  | KERB_P.      | 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
      | OctetString (The principal@realm name) ... 
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
    
4.2.1. Operational Setting using Kerberos 
    
      An authorizing entity is configured to construct the AUTH_SESSION 
   policy element that designates use of the Kerberos authentication 
   method (KRB_PRINCIPAL) as defined in RFC-1510.  Upon reception of 
   the resource reservation request, the router/PDP contacts the local 
   KDC, with a KRB_AS_REQ message, to request credentials for the 
   authorizing entity (principal@realm). The local KDC responds with 
   these credentials in a KRB_AS_REP message, 
   encrypted in the client's key.  The credentials consist of 1) a 
 
Hamer, et al.                                                  [Page 14] 

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002 
                                     
 
   "ticket" for the server and 2) a temporary encryption key (often 
   called a "session key"). The router/PDP uses the ticket to access 
   the authorizing entity with a KRB_AP_REQ message. The session key 
   (now shared by the router/PDP and the authorizing entity) is used to 
   authenticate the router/PDP, and is used to authenticate the 
   authorizing entity. The session key is an encryption key and is also 
   used to encrypt further communication between the two parties. The 
   authorizing entity responds by sending a concatenated message of a 
   KRB_AP_REP and a KRB_SAFE. The KRB_AP_REP is used to authenticate 
   the authorizing entity. The KRB_SAFE message contains the 
   authentication data in the safe-body field. The authentication data 
   must be either a 16 byte MD5 hash or 20 byte SHA-1 hash of all data 
   in the AUTH_SESSION policy element up to the AUTHENTICATION_DATA 
   (note that when using Kerberos the AUTH SESSION PE should not 
   include AUTHENTICATION DATA as this is sent in the KRB_SAFE 
   message). The router/PDP independently computes the hash, and 
   compares it with the received hash in the user-data field of the 
   KRB-SAFE-BODY [RFC-1510].  
    
   At a minimum, all AUTH_SESSION implementations using Kerberos MUST 
   support the Kerberos des-cbc-md5 encryption type [RFC-1510](for 
   encrypted data in tickets and Kerberos messages) and the Kerberos 
   rsa-md5-des checksum type [RFC-1510] (for the KRB_SAFE checksum) 
   checksum. New algorithms may be added by the IETF standards process. 
   Triple-DES encryption is supported in many Kerberos implementations 
   (although not specified in [RFC-1510]), and should be used over 
   single DES. 
    
   For cases where the authorizing entity is in a different realm (i.e. 
   administrative domain, organizational boundary), the router/PDP 
   needs to fetch a cross-realm Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from its 
   local KDC. This TGT can be used to fetch authorizing entity tickets 
   from the KDC in the remote realm. Note that for performance 
   considerations, tickets are typically cached for extended periods.

4.3 Public Key 
    
      In a public key environment, the AUTH_ENT_ID MUST be of the 
   subtypes: X509_V3_CERT or PGP_CERT. The authentication data is used 
   for authenticating the authorizing entity.  An example of the public 
   key AUTH_SESSION policy element is shown below.

      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+ 
    
4.3.1. Operational Setting for public key based authentication 
    
      Public key based authentication assumes the following: 
    
         -  Authorizing entities have a pair of keys (private key and 
            public key). 
    
         -  Private key is secured with the authorizing entity. 
    
         -  Public keys are stored in digital certificates and a    
            trusted party, certificate authority (CA) issues these  
            digital certificates. 
    
         -  The verifier (PDP or router) has the ability to verify the 
            digital certificate. 
    
    
   Authorizing entity uses its private key to generate 
   AUTHENTICATION_DATA. Authenticators (router, PDP) use the 
   authorizing entity∆s public key (stored in the digital certificate) 
   to verify and authenticate the policy element. 
    
4.3.1.1 X.509 V3 digital certificates 
    
   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type X509_V3_CERT, AUTHENTICATION_DATA 
   MUST be generated following these steps: 
    

 
Hamer, et al.                                                  [Page 16] 

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002 
                                     
 
   - A Signed-data is constructed as defined in section 5 of CMS [RFC-
   3369]. A digest is computed on the content (as specified in section 
   6.1) with a signer-specific message-digest algorithm. The digest 
   output is digitally signed following section 8 of RFC-2437, using 
   the signer's private key.  
     
   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type X509_V3_CERT, verification MUST be 
   done following these steps: 
    
   - Parse the X.509 V3 certificate to extract the distinguished name 
   of the issuer of the certificate. 
   - Certification Path Validation is performed as defined in section 6 
   of RFC-3280. 
   - Parse through the Certificate Revocation list to verify that the 
   received certificate is not listed. 
   - Once  the X.509 V3 certificate is validated, the public key of the 
   authorizing entity can be extracted from the certificate. 
   - Extract the digest algorithm and the length of the digested data 
   by parsing the CMS signed-data. 
   - The recipient independently computes the message digest.  This 
   message digest and the signer's public key are used to verify the 
   signature value. 
    
   This verification ensures integrity, non-repudiation and data 
   origin. 
    
    
4.3.1.2 PGP digital certificates 
    
   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type PGP_CERT, AUTHENTICATION_DATA MUST 
   be generated following these steps: 
    
   - AUTHENTICATION_DATA contains a Signature Packet as defined in 
   section 5.2.3 of RFC-2440. In summary: 
     - Compute the hash of all data in the AUTH_SESSION policy element 
      up to the AUTHENTICATION_DATA. 
     - The hash output is digitally signed following section 8 of RFC-
     2437, using the signer's private key.  
      
   When the AUTH_ENT_ID is of type PGP_CERT, verification MUST be done 
   following these steps: 
    
   - Parse the PGP certificate to extract the distinguished name of the 
   issuer of the certificate. 
   - Validate the certificate. 
   - Parse through the Certificate Revocation list to verify that the 
   received certificate is not listed. 
   - Once the PGP certificate is validated, the public key of the 
   authorizing entity can be extracted from the certificate. 
   - Extract the hash algorithm and the length of the hashed data by 
   parsing the PGP signature packet.

   - The recipient independently computes the message digest.  This 
   message digest and the signer's public key are used to verify the 
   signature value. 
    
   This verification ensures integrity, non-repudiation and data 
   origin. 
    
    
5. Framework 
    
   [S-AUTH] describes a framework in which the AUTH_SESSION 
   policy element may be utilized to transport information required for  
   authorizing resource reservation for media flows. [S-AUTH] 
   introduces 4 different models:  
   1- the coupled model  
   2- the associated model with one policy server  
   3- the associated model with two policy servers  
   4- the non-associated model. 
     
   The fields that are required in an AUTH SESSION policy element 
   dependent on which of the models is used. 
    
5.1 The coupled model 
    
   In the Coupled Model, the only information that MUST be included in 
   the policy element is the SESSION ID; it is used by the Authorizing 
   Entity to correlate the resource reservation request with the media 
   authorized during session set up. Since the End Host is assumed to 
   be untrusted, the Policy Server SHOULD take measures to ensure that 
   the integrity of the SESSION ID is preserved in transit; the exact 
   mechanisms to be used and the format of the SESSION ID are 
   implementation dependent. 
    
 
 
5.2 The associated model with one policy server 
    
   In this model, the contents of the AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST 
   include: 
    
   -  A session identifier - SESSION_ID. This is information that the 
      authorizing entity can use to correlate the resource reservation 
      request with the media authorized during session set up. 
     
   -  The identity of the authorizing entity - AUTH_ENT_ID. This 
      information is used by the Edge Router to determine which 
      authorizing entity (Policy Server) should be used to solicit 
      resource policy decisions. 
    
   In some environments, an Edge Router may have no means for 
   determining if the identity refers to a legitimate Policy Server

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002
                                     
 
   within its domain. In order to protect against redirection of 
   authorization requests to a bogus authorizing entity, the 
   AUTH_SESSION MUST also include: 
    
   -  AUTHENTICATION_DATA. This authentication data is calculated over   
      all other fields of the AUTH_SESSION policy element. 
     
    
5.3 The associated model with two policy servers 
    
   The content of the AUTH_SESSION Policy Element is identical to the 
   associated model with one policy server. 
    
5.4 The non-associated model 
    
   In this model, the AUTH_SESSION MUST contain sufficient information 
   to allow the Policy Server to make resource policy decisions 
   autonomously from the authorizing entity. The policy element is 
   created using information about the session by the authorizing 
   entity. The information in the AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST 
   include: 
    
   -  Calling party IP address or Identity (e.g. FQDN) - SOURCE_ADDR S-
      TYPE 
   -  Called party IP address or Identity (e.g. FQDN) - DEST_ADDR S-
      TYPE 
   -  The characteristics of (each of) the media stream(s) authorized 
      for this session - RESOURCES S-TYPE 
   -  The authorization lifetime - START_TIME S-TYPE 
   -  The identity of the authorizing entity to allow for validation of 
      the token in shared symmetric key and Kerberos schemes - 
      AUTH_ENT_ID S-TYPE 
   -  The credentials of the authorizing entity in a public-key scheme 
      - AUTH_ENT_ID S-TYPE 
   -  Authentication data used to prevent tampering with the 
      AUTH_SESSION policy element - AUTHENTICATION_DATA 
    
   Furthermore, the AUTH_SESSION policy element MAY contain: 
    
   - The lifetime of (each of) the media stream(s) - END_TIME S-TYPE 
   - Calling party port number - SOURCE_ADDR S-TYPE 
   - Called party port number - DEST_ADDR S-TYPE 
    
   All AUTH_SESSION fields MUST match with the resource request. If a 
   field does not match, the request SHOULD be denied.

6. Message Processing Rules 
    
6.1 Generation of the AUTH_SESSION by the authorizing entity 
    
   1. Generate the AUTH_SESSION policy element with the appropriate 
   contents as specified in section 5. 
    
   2. If authentication is needed, the entire AUTH_SESSION policy 
   element is constructed, excluding the length, type and subtype 
   fields of the AUTH_SESSION field. Note that the message MUST include 
   either a START_TIME or a SESSION_ID (See Section 9), to prevent 
   replay attacks. The output of the authentication algorithm, plus 
   appropriate header information, is appended to the AUTH_SESSION 
   policy element.  
    
6.2 Message Generation (RSVP Host) 
    
   An RSVP message is created as specified in [RFC-2205] with the 
   following modifications. 
    
   1. RSVP message MUST contain at most one AUTH_SESSION policy 
   element. 
    
   2. The AUTH SESSION policy element received from the authorizing 
   entity (Section 3.2) MUST be copied without modification into the 
   POLICY DATA object. 
          
   3. POLICY_DATA object (containing the AUTH_SESSION policy element) 
   is inserted in the RSVP message in the appropriate place.  
    
6.3 Message Reception (RSVP-aware Router) 
    
   RSVP message is processed as specified in [RFC-2205] with following 
   modifications. 
    
   1. If router is policy aware then it SHOULD send the RSVP 
   message to the PDP and wait for response. If the router is 
   policy unaware then it ignores the policy data objects and 
   continues processing the RSVP message. 
    
   2. Reject the message if the response from the PDP is negative. 
    
   3. Continue processing the RSVP message. 
    
6.4 Authorization (Router/PDP) 
    
   1. Retrieve the AUTH_SESSION policy element. Check the PE type 
   field and return an error if the identity type is not supported. 
    
   2. Verify the message integrity. 
    
 
Hamer, et al.                                                  [Page 20] 

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002 
                                     
 
   - Shared symmetric key authentication: The Network   
     router/PDP uses the AUTH_ENT_ID field to consult a table keyed by  
     that field. The table should identify the cryptographic  
     authentication algorithm to be used along with the expected length  
     of the authentication data and the shared  
     symmetric key for the authorizing entity. Verify that the   
     indicated length of the authentication data is consistent with  
     the configured table entry and validate the authentication   
     data. 
    
   - Public Key: Validate the certificate chain against the 
     trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and validate the 
     message signature using the public key. 
    
   - Kerberos Ticket: If the AUTH_ENT_ID is of subtype KRB_PRINCIPAL,  
     Request a ticket for the authorizing entity (principal@realm) 
     from the local KDC. Use the ticket to access the authorizing  
     entity and obtain authentication data for the message. 
    
   3. Verify the requested resources do not exceed the authorized QoS. 
    
    
7. Error Signaling 
    
   If a PDP fails to verify the AUTH_SESSION policy element then it 
   MUST return a policy control failure (Error Code = 02) to the PEP. 
   The error values are described in [RFC-2205] and [RFC-2750]. Also 
   the PDP SHOULD supply a policy data object containing an AUTH_DATA 
   Policy Element with A-Type=POLICY_ERROR_CODE containing more 
   details on the Policy Control failure [RFC-3182]. If RSVP is being    
   used, the PEP MUST include this Policy Data object in the outgoing  
   RSVP Error message. 
    
8. IANA Considerations 
    
   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], Standard 
   RSVP Policy Elements (P-type values) are assigned by IETF Consensus 
   action as described in [RFC-2750]. 
    
   P-Type AUTH_SESSION is assigned the value TBD-by-IANA. 
    
   Following the policies outlined in [IANA-CONSIDERATIONS], session 
   authorization attribute types (S-Type)in the range 0-127 are

9. Security Considerations 
    
   The purpose of this draft is to describe a mechanism for session 
   authorization to prevent theft of service.  
    
   Replay attacks MUST be prevented. In the non-associated model, the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element MUST include a START_TIME field and the 
   Policy Servers MUST support NTP to ensure proper clock 
   synchronization. The start time is used to verify that the request 
   is not being replayed at a later time. In all other models, the 
   SESSION_ID is used by the Policy Server to ensure that the resource 
   request successfully correlates with records of an authorized 
   session. If a AUTH_SESSION is replayed, it MUST be detected by the 
   policy server (using internal algorithms) and the request MUST be 
   rejected. 
    
   To ensure that the integrity of the policy element is preserved in  
   untrusted environments, the AUTHENTICATION_DATA attribute MUST be 
   included.  
    
   In order to keep the AUTH_SESSION policy element size to a strict 
   minimum, in environments where shared symmetric keys are possible, 
   they should be used. This is especially true in wireless 
   environments where the AUTH_SESSION policy element is sent over-the-
   air. The shared symmetric keys authentication option MUST be 
   supported by all AUTH_SESSION implementations. 
    
   If shared symmetric keys are not a valid option, the Kerberos 
   authentication mechanism is reasonably well secured and efficient in 
 
Hamer, et al.                                                  [Page 23] 

Internet Draft       Session Authorization Policy Element   October 2002 
                                     
 
   terms of AUTH_SESSION size. The AUTH_SESSION only needs to contain 
   the principal@realm name of the authorizing entity. This is much 
   more efficient than the PKI authentication option. 
          
   PKI authentication option provides a high level of security and good 
   scalability, however it requires the presence of credentials in the 
   AUTH_SESSION policy element which impacts its size.
