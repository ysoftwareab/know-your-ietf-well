                     Wide BGP Communities Attribute
                 draft-ietf-idr-wide-bgp-communities-03

Abstract

   Route tagging plays an important role in external BGP [RFC4271]
   relations, in communicating various routing policies between peers.
   It is also a very common best practice among operators to propagate
   various additional information about routes intra-domain.  The most
   common tool used today to attach various information about routes is
   through the use of BGP communities [RFC1997].

   Such information is important to allow BGP speakers to perform some
   mutually agreed actions without the need to maintain a separate
   offline database for each tuple of prefix and associated set of
   action entries.

   This document defines a new encoding which will enhance and simplify
   what can be accomplished today with the use of BGP communities.  The
   most important addition this specification makes over currently
   defined BGP communities is the ability to specify, carry as well as
   use for execution an operator's defined set of parameters.  It also
   provides an extensible platform for any new community encoding needs
   in the future.

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   RFC 1997 [RFC1997] defines the BGP Community Attribute.  This
   attribute is used as a tool to carry additional information in BGP
   routes which may help to automate peering administration.  The BGP
   Communities Attribute consists of one or more sets of four octet
   values, where each specifies a different community.  Except for two
   reserved ranges, the encoding of community values mandates that the
   first two octets are to contain the Autonomous System number, with
   the next two octets containing some locally defined value.

   With the introduction of 4-octet Autonomous System numbers by RFC
   4893 [RFC4893] it became obvious that BGP Communities as specified in
   RFC 1997 will not be able to accommodate new AS encoding.  In fact



Raszuk, et al.            Expires March 6, 2017                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


   RFC 4893 explicitly recommends use of four octets AS specific
   [RFC5668] extended communities [RFC4360] as a way to encode new 4
   octet AS numbers.

   While the encoding of 4 octet AS numbers is being addressed by
   [I-D.ietf-idr-as4octet-extcomm-generic-subtype], neither the base BGP
   communities (standard or extended) nor as4octet-extcomm-generic
   document define a sufficient level of encoding freedom which could be
   of practical use.  The authors believe that defining a new BGP Path
   Attribute, with the ability to contain locally defined parameters
   will enhance the current level of network policies, as well as
   simplify BGP policy management.  The proposed simple encoding will
   also facilitate the delivery of new network services without a need
   to define a new BGP extension each time.

   When defining any new type of tool there is always a unique
   opportunity to specify a subset of well recognized behaviors.  Lists
   of the current most commonly used BGP communities, as well as
   provision for a new registry for future definitions will be contained
   in a separate document.

2.  Protocol Summary

   Each Wide BGP Community consists of two main parts - Common Container
   Header and Community Container type.  Implementation of any type is
   optional.  Implementation is considered to comply with this document
   if at least one community type is supported.

2.1.  Common Container Header

   Common Container Header is defined in Section 3.1 and contains
   following encoding:

   o  Container Types: Types 1,2,3 and 4 are defined in this document.

   o  Flags: to control common behavior including the transitivness of
      the community container.

   o  Length

   o  Context AS This is the AS number by which community should be
      interpreted.

2.2.  Community Containers

   This memo defines four Community Containers with the following
   encoding

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


2.2.1.  Type 1 Wide Community Container

   The Type 1 Wide Community Container is defined in Section 4.

   o  Community Value: This section defines the action that an operator
      wishes a router to take.

   o  Source AS: This is the AS originating the community.

   o  Target(s): This is an optional list that encodes where the
      community's action should be taken.

   o  Exclude Target(s): This is an optional list that encodes where the
      community's actions should not be taken.

   o  Parameters: This is an optional list that encodes additional
      information that the community's action needs to execute properly.

   o  Community Atoms.  These are values and lists of values that are
      common across community actions.  They are defined in Section 8.

2.2.2.  Type 2 Wide Community Container

   The Type 2 Wide BGP Community 4:4 is defined in Section 5 and
   contains the following encoding:

   o  Community Value: Fixed length -> 4 octet : 4 octet community

2.2.3.  Type 3 Wide Community Container

   The Type 3 Wide BGP Community Nx4 is defined in Section 6 and
   contains the following encoding:

   o  Community Value: Variable length -> Nx4 octet community

2.2.4.  Type 4 Wide Community Container

   The Type 4 Wide BGP Community 16+Nx4 is defined in Section 7 and
   contains the following encoding:

   o  Community Value: Variable length -> Fixed 16 octet field followed
      by N x 4 octet community

3.  Wide BGP Community Attribute

   This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute, the Wide BGP
   Community.  The attribute type code is (TBA by IANA).

   The Wide BGP Community Attribute is an optional, transitive BGP
   attribute, and may be present only once in the BGP UPDATE message.

   The attribute contains a number of typed containers.  Any given
   container type may appear multiple times, unless that container
   type's definition specifies otherwise.

3.1.  Wide BGP Community Attribute Common Container Header

   Containers always start with the following common header:

      0                   1                   2                   3

     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   This document defines Types 1,2,3 and 4.  See the Section 14 for
   information on additional type registration policies.

   +------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+
   | Bit  | Value | Meaning                                            |

   |  0   |   0   | Transitive across AS boundary                      |
   |      |   1   | Not Transitive across AS boundary                  |
   |  1   |   0   | Transitive across confederation boundaries         |
   |      |   1   | Not transitive across confederation boundaries     |

   | 3..7 |   -   | RESERVED - MUST be zero when sent and ignored upon |

   +------+-------+----------------------------------------------------+

   Flags are defined globally, to apply to all wide community container
                                  types.

                              Table 1: Flags

   Bit 0 (aka T bit) Transitivity bit: Value 0: The communities in the
   container are transitive across all ASes.  Value 1: The communities
   in the container are transitive across AS boundaries, but not across
   an administration boundary.  An administration in this sense is an
   arbitrary set of connected ASes, possibly owned by a single
   administration.  How such an administration boundary is determined is
   out of scope of this document.

   Bit 1 (aka C bit) Confederation bit: Is used to manage the
   propagation scope of a given Wide BGP Community across confederation
   boundaries.  When not set (value of 0) indicates that communities in
   a given container are transitive across confederation boundary.  When
   set (value 1) communities are not transitive across confederation
   sub-AS boundary.

   Bit 2 (aka R bit) Registered bit: When set (value 1) indicates that
   the given container carries a Wide BGP Community which is registered
   with IANA.  When not set (value 0) it indicates that community value
   which follows is locally assigned with a local only meaning and local
   behaviour.

   The Length field represents the total length of a given container in
   octets.

   Context Autonomous System Number: 4 octets

   This identifies the AS that is to interpret the community container.
   For example, an ISP may publish a set of community specifications.  A
   customer of the ISP will use those specifications to formulate the
   communities.  The ISP will read the communities and perform the
   instructions encoded as per the specifications.  The Context ASN is
   the ASN of the ISP.  The ISP is usually directly connected to the
   customer, but if not, then the intervening network has the
   opportunity to pass the routes to the Context ASN if it chooses to do
   so.

   The Wide BGP Community Type 1 container is of variable size (but

                    Figure 4: Wide BGP Community Type 1

4.1.  Community Value

   Community Value: 4 octets

      The Wide BGP Community value indicates what set of actions a
      router is requested to take upon reception of a route containing
      this community.  The semantics of this value depend on whether
      this is a private/local community or registered.

4.2.  Source AS Number

   Source Autonomous System Number: 4 octets

      The Autonomous System number which indicates the originator of
      this Wide BGP Community.

      When the Autonomous System is a two octet number the first two
      octets of this 4 octet value MUST be filled with zeros.

4.3.  Wide Community Target(s) TLV

   The Wide Community Target(s) TLV (Sub-Type 1) contains a list of a
   Wide Community atoms.

   Wide Community Targets define the matching criteria for the
   community.  A given wide community may have a number of targets that
   it applies to.  The semantics of these targets will vary on a per

   community basis.  Depending on the definition of the community,
   targets may be optional.

   The value field of the Wide Community Target(s) TLV is a series of
   Wide Community Atom TLVs.  The semantics of any given atom TLV MUST
   be part of the definition of a given Wide Community.

   Typically, Wide Community Targets consist of a series of atoms that
   have "match any" semantics.  Thus, if any given target matches per
   the semantics of that atom for the community, the community is
   considered to match and the action defined by the community should be
   executed.

   When no Target(s) TLV is specified, it is considered "match all".

   If the semantics of a given atom is undefined for the community in
   question, it MUST be ignored.

   When no targets are required by the definition of a given Wide
   Community, the Wide Community Target(s) TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in
   the community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide
   Community Target(s) TLV with an empty value field.

4.4.  Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV

   The Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV (Sub-Type 2) contains a list
   of a Wide Community atoms.

   Wide Community Exclude Targets define criteria by which the community
   is considered to NOT match.  Depending on the semantics of the Wide
   Community, Exclude Target(s) may be optional.

   The semantic of the Wide Community Exclude Target(s) is to match all
   specified Target(s) with the exception of those listed in this TLV.

   The value field of the Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV is a
   series of Wide Community Atom TLVs.  The semantics of any given atom
   TLV MUST be part of the definition of a given Wide Community.

   If the semantics of a given atom is undefined for the community in
   question, it MUST be ignored.

   If the Wide Community Target(s) TLV and the Wide Community Exclude
   Target(s) TLV have conflicting semantics, priority MUST be given to
   the Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV.

   When no exclude targets are required by the definition of a given
   Wide Community, the Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV SHOULD NOT

   be encoded in the community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to
   accept a Wide Community Exclude Target(s) TLV with an empty value
   field.

4.5.  Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV

   The Wide Community Parameter(s) TLV (Sub-Type 3) contains a list of a
   Wide Community atoms.

   A given wide community may have parameters which are used as inputs
   for executing actions defined for that community.  These parameters,
   and any constraints implied by the parameters, MUST be defined by the
   wide community definition.  Parameters consist of an ordered set of
   atom sub-TLVs.  The semantics of any specific positional instance of
   an atom MUST be defined by the wide community.

   If it is the case that a parameter for a given community is of an
   unexpected type or length, the community MUST be ignored.

   If it is the case that there are too many or two few parameters for a
   given community, the community MUST be ignored.

   When no parameters are required by the definition of a given Wide
   Community, the Wide Community Paramters TLV SHOULD NOT be encoded in
   the community.  Implementations MUST be prepared to accept a Wide
   Community Parameter TLV with an empty value field.

4.6.  Usage

   The detailed interpretation of the targets or parameters SHALL be
   provided when describing given community type in a separate document
   or when locally defined by an operator.

5.  Container Type 2: BGP Wide Community 4:4

   The Wide BGP Community Type 2 container is of fixed size (length 8
   octets) and is encoded as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

5.1.  Community Value

   The BGP Community Container type 2 is a fixed eight octet value (4+4)

   A 4:4 Community Container begins with the Common Container Header
   followed by a number of communities.  Each community is 8 octets
   long.  The length field in the header is the length of the header
   itself plus 8 times the number of communities after the header.

   The Transitivity across AS boundary (T bit) or across confederation
   boundary (C bit) should be subject to local policy setting with
   default being set to 0 on both bits indicating full transitivness.
   The R flag should be set indicating IANA registration.

   The same community value SHOULD NOT appear multiple times within the
   same update message.  If it does, then a receiving BGP speaker MAY
   discard the duplicates.

   If a community container has Transitivity 0, transitive across all
   ASes, then a BGP speaker SHOULD be configured to strip all received
   transitive communities that have an unexpected Context ASN.

   The textual representation of a 4:4 Community is A:B:C, where A is
   the Context ASN, B is the first 4 octets and C is the final 4 octets
   of the community.  Each ranges from 0 to 4294967295.  Each is a
   decimal non-negative integer without leading zeros.  Each number must
   appear, even if it is 0.  For example, "0:1:2" cannot be written as
   ":1:2".

   Even though the Context ASN appears once in the container header,
   when each community is processed by the routing policy language, each
   community has the Context ASN individually prepended to it.

6.  Container Type 3: BGP Wide Community Nx4

   The Wide BGP Community Type 3 container is of variable size (min
   length 4 octets) and is encoded as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

6.1.  Community Value

   Value: N times 4 octets

   The BGP Community Container type 3 (aka as Nx4) contains a variable
   length value.

   The Community Container begins with the Common Container Header
   followed by a number of 4 octet values.  The length field in the
   header is the length of the header itself plus total length of 4
   octet values.

   The Transitivity across AS boundary (T bit) or across confederation
   boundary (C bit) should be subject to local policy setting with
   default being set to 1 on both bits indicating no transitivness
   across administration boundary and confederation boundaries.  The R
   flag should be set indicating IANA registration.

7.  Container Type 4: BGP Wide Community 16+Nx4

   The Wide BGP Community Type 4 container is of variable size (min
   length 16 octets) and is encoded as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3

   The Community Container begins with the Common Container Header
   followed by a single 16 octet field then optionally followed by
   number of 4 octet values.  The length field in the header is the
   length of the header itself plus total length of 4 octet values.

   The Transitivity across AS boundary (T bit) or across confederation
   boundary (C bit) should be subject to local policy setting with
   default being set to 1 on both bits indicating no transitivness
   across administration boundary and confederation boundaries.  The R
   flag should be set indicating IANA registration.

8.  Wide Community Atoms

   Some types of Wide BGP Communities (for example Type 1) will act on
   and hence need to encode some distinct atoms of data.  Use of atoms
   is solely subject to definition of the specific BGP Container type.
   Atoms are encoded as TLVs, where each TLV has the following format:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Type      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |            Length             |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |                         Value (variable)                      |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Type field contains a value of 1-254.  The values 0 and 255 are
   reserved for future use.  The TLV types are to be assigned and
   maintained by IANA registry.

   The Length represents the total length of a given TLV's value field
   in octets.

   The Value field contains the TLV value.

   Supported format of the TLVs can be:

     Type  1: Autonomous System number list
     Type  2: IPv4 prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix) list
     Type  3: IPv6 prefix (1 octet prefix length + prefix) list
     Type  4: Integer list
     Type  5: IEEE Floating Point Number list
     Type  6: Neighbor Class list
     Type  7: User-defined Class list
     Type  8: UTF-8 String

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


   The semantics of a given atom will depend upon the context in which
   it is used, as defined by the containing wide community.

   In the following sections defining the different atoms, validation
   rules for the Length of the atom will be presented.  If the Length of
   the atom does not match the rules for that atom, it SHALL be
   considered malformed.  (See Section 11.)

8.1.  The Autonomous System number list atom

   This atom represents a list of Autonomous System numbers, each 4
   octets in size.  The minimum Length of this atom is 4 octets.  The
   Length MUST be a multiple of 4.

   For consistent treatment, all AS numbers MUST be encoded as 4 octet
   values.  When encoding two octet ASes, the first two octets of this
   four octet value MUST be filled with zeros.

   Two special values are reserved for the Autonomous System atoms:

     0x00000000 - to indicate "No Autonomous Systems".
     0xFFFFFFFF - to indicate "All Autonomous Systems".

8.2.  The IPv4 and IPv6 prefix list atoms

   This atom represents a list of IPv4 or IPv6 prefix.  IPv4 and IPv6
   prefix atom values are encoded in the same format used by BGP NLRI in
   Section 4.3 of [RFC4271].

   +---------------------------+
   |  Prefix Length (1 octet)  |
   +---------------------------+
   |  Prefix (variable)        |
   +---------------------------+

   The Prefix Length for IPv4 prefixes must be in the range of 0..32.

   The Prefix Length for IPv6 prefixes must be in the range of 0..128.

   The Length field must be able to accommodate the list of prefixes
   according to the encoding rules.  If the Length cannot fully
   accommodate the required number of octets to encode the Prefix Length
   and the Prefix, the atom is considered malformed.

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


8.3.  The Integer list atom

   This atom represents a list of Integers.  Integers are a fixed Length
   of 4 octets and are stored in network byte order.

   The minimum Length of the Integer list atom is 4 octets.  The Length
   MUST be a multiple of 4.

8.4.  The IEEE Floating Point Number list atom

   This atom represents a list of floating point numbers.  Floating
   point numbers are a fixed Length of 4 octets and are stored in
   [IEEE.754.1985] format.

   This atom represents a list of floating point numbers.

   The minimum Length of the Floating Point Number list atom is 4
   octets.  The Length MUST be a multiple of 4.

8.5.  The Neighbor Class list atom

   The Neighbor Class list atom represents a classification of a BGP
   peering session, each 4 octets in size.  This class currently can
   contain three values:

     1 - Peer:     This class is typically applied to sessions where a
                   transit-free relationship exists between two
                   providers.
     2 - Customer: This class is typically applied to sessions where
                   the remote end of the session is operated by a
                   customer.
     3 - Upstream: This class is typically applied to sessions where the
                   remote end of the session is operated by a network
                   from which you receive transit routes.

   The Neighbor Class list atom represents a classification of a BGP
   peering session.

   The minimum Length of the Neighbor Class list atom is 4 octets.  The
   Length MUST be a multiple of 4.

8.6.  The User-defined Class list atom

   Similar to the Neighbor Class atom, the User-defined Class list atom
   represents a classification of a network property.  The exact
   property definition is up to the semantics of the defining Autonomous
   System.  The semantics governing a given User-defined Class list are
   defined by the Context AS Number.



Raszuk, et al.            Expires March 6, 2017                [Page 15]

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


   Examples of User-defined Class properties include geography (East,
   West), continent (North America, Asia, Europe), etc.  Similar to the
   [RFC1997] BGP Communities, it is necessary that the Context AS
   provide a registry of the value and the semantics of a given
   community.

   The minimum Length of the User-defined Class list atom is 4 octets.
   The Length of this atom MUST be a multiple of 4.

8.7.  The UTF-8 String atom

   The UTF-8 String atom represents an arbitrary Unicode string in UTF-8
   [RFC3629] format.  The Length is required to be of sufficient size to
   carry the UTF-8 string in the Value field.

   Implementations MUST be prepared for truncated/improperly formed
   UTF-8 strings.  When detecting such a string, the implementation
   should remove trailing octets of a multi-octet sequence in order to
   have a well-formed string.

   Implementations MUST be prepared to receive empty (zero-Length) UTF-8
   String atoms as they may be used as Parameters.

9.  Well Known Standard BGP Communities

   According to RFC 1997, as well as IANA's Well-Known BGP Communities
   registry, the following BGP communities are defined to have global
   significance:

        0xFFFF0000   planned-shut         [draft-francois-bgp-gshut]
        0xFFFFFF01   NO_EXPORT            [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF02   NO_ADVERTISE         [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF03   NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED  [RFC1997]
        0xFFFFFF04   NOPEER               [RFC3765]

   This document recommends for simplicity as well as for avoidance of
   backward compatibility issues the continued use of BGP Standard
   Community Attribute type 8 as defined in RFC 1997 to distribute non
   Autonomous System specific Well-Known BGP Communities.

   For the same reason, this document does not intended to obsolete the
   currently defined and deployed BGP Extended Communities.

10.  Operational Considerations

   Having two different ways to propagate locally assigned BGP
   communities, one via the use of Standard BGP Communities and the
   other one via the use of Wide BGP Communities, may seem to



Raszuk, et al.            Expires March 6, 2017                [Page 16]

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


   potentially cause problems when considering propagation of
   conflicting actions.  However, even at present, an operator may
   append Standard BGP Communities with conflicting information.  It is
   therefore recommended that any implementation, in supporting both
   standard and Wide BGP communities, allow for their easy inbound and
   outbound processing.  The actual execution of all communities should
   be treated as a union and, if supported by an implementation, their
   execution permissions are to be a local configuration matter.

11.  Error Handling

   If a length field overshoots the attribute as determined by the
   attribute length, then the attribute is malformed.  If the length of
   any BGP Community Container would indicate a fractional number of
   communities, i.e. it is not divisible by 8 after subtracting the
   length of the header, then the attribute is malformed.  In each case,
   the update message should be treated as withdrawn.  Further
   procedures are described in [RFC7606]

   If any atom in a Wide Community container's Exclude Targets TLV is
   unrecognized, no actions should be taken for that Wide Community.
   While the Targets TLV is meant to be inclusive, the Exclude Targets
   TLV is meant to be proscriptive of applying the action.

   If any Wide Community container or atoms contained therein are
   determined to be malformed, the Wide Community Path attribute must be
   considered malformed.  BGP implementations should use "treat-as-
   withdraw" semantics as defined in [I-D.ietf-idr-error-handling].

12.  Example

12.1.  Example Type 1 Wide Community Definition

   An operator of an AS 64496, wishes to locally define a Wide Community
   with the semantics of permitting AS_PATH prepending with targets that
   include AS numbers of peer ASes and peers who have been marked with a
   set of enumerated city locations.

   AS 64496 has established a registered set of values to use for its
   User-defined Class:

      100 - Amsterdam
      101 - New York
      102 - San Francisco
      103 - Tokyo
      104 - Moscow

   Target semantics:

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


      The Autonomous System Number list atom refers to the target peer
      AS Numbers.

      The User-defined Class for AS 64496 has been defined elsewhere and
      the values 100..104 may be used for this locally defined Wide
      Community.

      The Targets TLV MUST contain at least one entry.

      The Exclude Targets TLV MAY contain entries of the above supported
      atoms.

      The semantics of all other atoms are undefined for this community.

   Parameter semantics:

      The parameter TLV shall consist of exactly one Integer atom value
      that is constrained to have a value of 2..8.

12.2.  Example Type 1 Wide BGP Community Encoding

     AS_PATH prepend 4 TIMES TO AS 2424, AS 8888, to peers marked as
     Amsterdam (100) or to peers marked Moscow (104), but not to peers
     in New York (101).

     Use Hop Count 0 to request the receiving router to not propagate
     this wide community.

     Locally community value (flag bit 0 = 0).
     Do not decrement Hop Count field across confederation boundaries
     (0)

     Local community 1 for sample AS 64496.

13.  Security considerations

   Transitive communities could unintentionally spread far from their
   origin.  If a router receives many routes from multiple sources on
   the Internet with different communities, it could cause significant
   memory usage.  To prevent excessive memory usage, routers should be
   configured to strip unexpected communities from received routes.

   All the security considerations for BGP Communities as well as for
   BGP RFCs apply here.

   Given the flexibility and power offered by Wide BGP communities, it
   is important to consider the additional possibilities allowed by
   their definition.  In particular, for locally defined Wide BGP
   Communities, it may be wise to restrict the range of parameters.  For
   registred Wide BGP Communities, the security considerations of the
   document defining them MUST address issues specific to those newly
   defined Wide Communities.

   Security considerations specific to Wide BGP Communities will be
   discussed in a later revision of this draft.

14.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new BGP Path Attribute called Wide BGP
   Community Attribute.  For this new type IANA is to allocate a new
   value in the corresponding registry:

   Registry Name: BGP Path Attributes

   This document makes the following assignments for the optional,
   transitive Wide BGP Communities Attribute:

     Name                                     Type Value
     ----                                     ----------
     Wide BGP Community Attribute                 TBA

   This document requests IANA to define and maintain a new registry
   named: "Wide BGP Communities Attribute Container Types".

   The pool of: 0x0000-0xFFFF has been defined for its allocations.  The
   allocation policy is on a first come, first served basis.

   64512-65534 are reserved for experimental use.  All other values are
   available on a first-come, first served basis.

15.  Change History

   Changes from -03 via -04 to -05:

      Update the Introduction.

      Substantial re-work of atom types removing proposed Group
      container and moving atoms to be lists.

      Added the Exclude Targets TLV to the Wide Community container.

      Added a section on error handling.

      Updated the example.

   Changes from -02 to -03:

      Removed C and R named bit fields originally from -00.

      Rename Target AS field to Context AS.

      Make Integer Atom a fixed 4 octets in length.

      Add Neighbor Class Atom

      Rename TTL to Hop Count

   Changes from -01 to -02:

      The Type field has been expanded to 2 octets.

      The Length field has been moved to the common header.

      Changed format to use TLVs.

Internet-Draft            wide-bgp-communities            September 2016


      Added atom TLV to define well defined syntactic items.

      Added TLVs to distinguish targets from parameters.

      Various editorial changes to language.

16.  Outstanding Issues

   The following are known issues that have yet to be resolved in this
   draft:

   o  The interaction of the Container TTL field with VPN peers.

   o  The name Wide Communities is overloaded in this document.  The
      scope of this feature has evolved since the initial -00 of the
      draft.  The general feature of a containerized BGP Community
      extension and the Type 1 container, the Wide community, currently
      share names.  "There are only two hard things in Computer Science:
      cache invalidation and naming things."
