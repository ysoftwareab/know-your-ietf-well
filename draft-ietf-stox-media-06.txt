1.  Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol [RFC3261] is a widely-deployed
   technology for the management of media sessions (such as voice and
   video calls) over the Internet.  SIP itself provides a signaling
   channel via TCP [RFC0793] or UDP [RFC0768], over which two or more
   parties can exchange messages for the purpose of negotiating a media
   session that uses a dedicated media channel such as the Real-time
   Transport Protocol (RTP) [RFC3550].  The Extensible Messaging and
   Presence Protocol (XMPP) [RFC6120] also provides a signaling channel,
   typically via TCP (although bindings for HTTP [XEP-0124] and
   WebSocket [RFC7395] also exist).

   Given the significant differences between XMPP and SIP, traditionally
   it was difficult to combine the two technologies in a single user
   agent (although nowadays such implementations are not uncommon, as



Saint-Andre, et al.     Expires January 06, 2016                [Page 2]

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


   described in [RFC7081]).  Thus in 2005 some developers wishing to add
   media session capabilities to XMPP clients defined a set of XMPP-
   specific session negotiation protocol extensions called Jingle (see
   especially [XEP-0166], [XEP-0167], and [XEP-0176]).

   Jingle was designed to easily map to SIP for communication through
   gateways or other transformation mechanisms.  Nevertheless, given the
   significantly different technology assumptions underlying XMPP and
   SIP, Jingle is different from SIP in several important respects:

   o  Base SIP messages and headers use a plaintext format similar in
      some ways to the Hypertext Transport Protocol [RFC7230], whereas
      Jingle messages are pure XML.  Mappings between SIP headers and
      Jingle message syntax are provided below.

   o  SIP payloads for session semantics use the Session Description
      Protocol [RFC4566], whereas the equivalent Jingle payloads use XML
      child elements of the Jingle <content/> element.  However, the
      Jingle specifications defining such child elements specify
      mappings to SDP for all Jingle syntax, making the mapping
      relatively straightforward.

   o  SIP messages have historically often been transported over UDP,
      whereas the signaling channel for Jingle is XMPP over TCP.
      Mapping between the transport layers typically happens within a
      gateway using techniques below the application level, and
      therefore is not addressed in this specification.

   Consistent with existing specifications for mapping between SIP and
   XMPP (see [RFC7247]), this document describes a bidirectional
   protocol mapping for use by gateways that enable the exchange of
   media signaling messages between systems that implement SIP and
   systems that implement the XMPP Jingle extensions.

   It is important to note that SIP and Jingle sessions could be
   gatewayed in a very simple way if all media were always routed and
   potentially even transcoded through the same gateway used for
   signaling.  By contrast, this specification defines a mapping that
   allows gateways to only intervene at the signaling level, thus
   letting user agents exchange media in an end-to-end or peer-to-peer
   manner without intervention by a specialized gateway (naturally, a
   media relay that supports TURN [RFC5766] might be used).  Such
   signaling-only gateways focus on handling session establishment and
   control within the context of what users would perceive as "calls".
   This document is hence primarily dealing with calling scenarios as
   opposed to generic media sessions or specialized sessions for
   functionality such as file transfer (see [RFC5547] and [XEP-0234]).

2.  Intended Audience

   The documents in this series are intended for use by software
   developers who have an existing system based on one of these
   technologies (e.g., SIP), and would like to enable communication from
   that existing system to systems based on the other technology (e.g.,
   XMPP).  We assume that readers are familiar with the core
   specifications for both SIP [RFC3261] and XMPP [RFC6120], with the
   base document for this series [RFC7247], and with the following
   media-related specifications:

   o  RTP Profile for Audio and Video Conferences with Minimal Control
      [RFC3551]

   o  The Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711]

   o  SDP: Session Description Protocol [RFC4566]

   o  Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE): A Protocol for
      Network Address Translator (NAT) Traversal for Offer/Answer
      Protocols [RFC5245]

   o  Jingle [XEP-0166]

   o  Jingle RTP Sessions [XEP-0167]

   o  Jingle ICE-UDP Transport Method [XEP-0176]

   o  Jingle Raw UDP Transport Method [XEP-0177]

3.  Terminology

   A number of technical terms used here are defined in [RFC3261],
   [RFC6120], [XEP-0166], and [XEP-0167].  The term "JID" is short for
   "Jabber Identifier".

   In flow diagrams, SIP traffic is shown using arrows such as "***>"
   whereas XMPP traffic is shown using arrows such as "...>".

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].

4.  Compatibility with Offer/Answer Model and Interactive Connectivity
    Establishment





Saint-Andre, et al.     Expires January 06, 2016                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


   Even if Jingle semantics have many similarities with those used in
   SIP, there are some use cases that cannot be handled in exactly the
   same way due to the Offer/Answer model used in SIP in conjunction
   with SDP.

   More specifically, mapping SIP and SDP Offer/Answer to XMPP is often
   complicated due to the difference in how each handles backward
   compatibility.  Jingle, as most other XMPP extensions, relies heavily
   on the XMPP extension for service discovery [XEP-0030], which implies
   that XMPP entities are able to verify the capabilities of their
   intended peer before attempting to establish a session with it.

   SDP Offer/Answer, on the other hand, uses a "least common
   denominator" approach where every SDP offer needs to be
   comprehensible by legacy endpoints.  Newer, unsupported aspects in
   this offer can therefore only appear as optional, or their use needs
   to be limited to subsequent Offer/Answer exchanges once their support
   has been confirmed.

   In particular, many older SIP endpoints do not support Interactive
   Connectivity Establishmen (ICE) [RFC5245].  A signaling gateway from
   Jingle to SIP has two primary alternatives for dealing with such
   endpoints on the SIP side:

   o  Require the use of ICE and otherwise fail the call by including
      the "Require: ice" SIP option tag [RFC5768] in the SIP INVITE that
      it sends on behalf of the Jingle initiator.

   o  Send an initial SIP INVITE for an ICE connection and, if the SIP
      endpoint indicates that it cannot handle ICE, send a re-INVITE for
      a non-ICE connection to the SIP endpoint and a Jingle transport-
      replace for a Raw UDP connection to the Jingle endpoint.  (This
      will introduce a potentialy large delay and might not result in a
      much higher percentage of calls succeeding unless the signaling
      gateway also offers a TURN [RFC5766] service for NAT traversal.)
      See Section 6 for further discussion.

   Use of "trickle ICE" is one significant example where this issue
   occurs.  From the beginning, Jingle supported the trickling of
   candidates (via Jingle messages of type 'transport-info'), and only
   years later was this behavior generalized
   [I-D.ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice] and then ported to SIP
   [I-D.ivov-mmusic-trickle-ice-sip].  Therefore SIP endpoints need to
   always behave like so-called "vanilla ICE" agents when sending their
   first offer and make sure they gather all candidates before sending a
   SIP INVITE.  This is necessary because otherwise ICE agents with no
   support for trickling of candidates can prematurely declare failure.
   Jingle endpoints, on the other hand, can verify support for trickling



Saint-Andre, et al.     Expires January 06, 2016                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


   of candidates prior to engaging in a session and adapt their behavior
   accordingly (and, as noted, trickling of candidates is standard
   operating procedure in Jingle).

   In order to work around this disparity in relation to communication
   of transport candidates, the Jingle RTP transport method [XEP-0176]
   defines a mode for supporting traditional Offer/Answer interactions
   through the "urn:ietf:rfc:3264" feature tag.  When an XMPP entity
   such as a client (or, significantly, a gateway to a SIP system)
   advertises support for this feature, the entity indicates that it
   needs to receive multiple transport candidates in the initial offer,
   instead of receiving them trickled over time.  Although
   implementations conforming to this specification MUST support the
   Offer/Answer model with Jingle, such endpoints SHOULD NOT actually
   declare support for the "urn:ietf:rfc:3264" service discovery feature
   since this would mean that they too would be reachable only through
   Offer/Answer semantics and not also through trickle-ICE semantics.

   The difference in handling of transport candidates also has an impact
   on ICE restarts (see Section 9.1.1.1 of [RFC5245]).  Because Jingle
   endpoints can send candidates at any time, when communicating
   directly with other Jingle endpoints they would not initiate an ICE
   restart simply in order to send a candidate that, for example,
   changes the media target.  However, as part of support for the Offer/
   Answer model a Jingle endpoint would instead need to initiate an ICE
   restart when communicating with a SIP endpoint or gateway that does
   not support trickle ICE.  Similarly, a Jingle endpoint needs to
   support the 'generation' attribute (used to signal an ICE restart)
   when communicating with a SIP endpoint or gateway that does not
   support trickle ICE.  See also the syntax discussion under
   Section 5.4.

5.  Syntax Mappings

5.1.  Generic Jingle Syntax

   Jingle is designed in a modular fashion, so that session description
   data is generally carried in a payload within high-level Jingle
   elements, i.e., the <jingle/> element and its <content/> child.  The
   following example illustrates this structure, where the XMPP stanza
   is a request to initiate an audio session (via the <content/> and
   <description/> elements) using a transport of RTP over raw UDP (via
   the <transport/> element).

   value MUST be considered as 'sendrecv'.

5.2.  Application Formats

   Jingle application formats for audio and video exchange via RTP are
   specified in [XEP-0167].  These application formats effectively map
   to the "RTP/AVP" profile specified in [RFC3551] and the "RTP/SAVP"
   profile specified in [RFC3711], where the media types are "audio" and
   "video" and the specific mappings to SDP syntax are provided in
   [XEP-0167].

   (As stated in [XEP-0167], future versions of that specification might
   define how to use other RTP profiles such as "RTP/AVPF" and "RTP/
   SAVPF" as defined in [RFC4585] and [RFC5124] respectively.)

5.3.  Raw UDP Transport Method

   A basic Jingle transport method for exchanging media over UDP is
   specified in [XEP-0177].  This "Raw UDP" transport method involves
   the negotiation of an IP address and port only.  It does not provide
   NAT traversal, effectively leaving the task to intermediary entities
   (which might be a media relay associated with but functionally
   independent of a signaling gateway).  The Jingle 'ip' attribute maps
   to the connection-address parameter of the SDP c= line and the 'port'
   attribute maps to the port parameter of the SDP m= line.  Use of SIP
   without ICE would generally map to use of Raw UDP on the XMPP side of
   a session.

5.4.  ICE-UDP Transport Method

   A more advanced Jingle transport method for exchanging media over UDP
   uses Interactive Connectivity Establishment and is specified in
   [XEP-0176].  By following the ICE methodology specified in [RFC5245],
   ideally this transport method provides NAT traversal for media.

   The relevant SDP mappings are provided in [XEP-0176].  However, those
   who implement signaling gateways need to be aware of a few syntax
   incompatibilities that need to be addressed by gateways conforming to
   this specification:

   o  The 'foundation' attribute is defined as a number in Jingle
      (unsigned byte) whereas ICE [RFC5245] defines it as a string,
      which can contain letters, digits and the '+' and '/' symbols.
      Gateway applications MUST therefore convert ICE originating
      foundations into integer numbers and they MUST guarantee that such
      a conversion preserves foundation uniqueness.  The exact mechanism
      for the conversion is undefined.

   o  Jingle defines a 'generation' attribute which is used to determine
      if an ICE restart is required.  This attribute has no counterpart
      in SIP because ICE restarts are initiated by detecting a change in
      the ICE 'ufrag' and 'pwd' (see Section 9.1.1.1 of [RFC5245]).
      Gateways MUST therefore increase the generation number when they
      detect such a change.

   o  The 'id' attribute defined by Jingle has no SIP counterpart; thus
      applications are free to choose means to generate unique
      identifiers across the different candidates of an ICE generation.

   o  The 'network' attribute defined by Jingle has no counterpart in
      SIP and SHOULD be ignored.

6.  Transport Fallback

   Most Jingle endpoints will first attempt to use ICE as specified for
   Jingle in [XEP-0176] (since that is most likely to result in NAT
   traversal) and only if that does not succeed will they fall back to
   raw UDP [XEP-0177].  This fallback approach is described in the
   Jingle ICE specification [XEP-0176].

   However, that approach depends on the use of XMPP service discovery
   [XEP-0030].  Because SIP does not have a method for determining
   endpoint capabilities, SIP endpoints use what can be termed "single-
   exchange fallback": they first try one method and if that fails they
   then send a re-INVITE with the second method.

   One way to map single-exchange fallback to Jingle is for the Jingle
   endpoint to attempt ICE first and send a transport-replace if the SIP
   answer indicates no support for ICE, then send a SIP re-INVITE with
   the addresses in the transport-accept.  Unfortunately, this approach
   will result a fairly substantial post-answer delay before media can
   flow.

   Because such delays usually result in an unacceptable user
   experience, the trend for many calling applications is to first send
   only a candidate that is known beforehand to be highly likely to
   result in NAT traversal, which is almost always a candidate at a
   media relay (i.e., an ICE candidate of type "relay").  Such
   applications will then offer and perhaps switch to a host candidate,
   peer reflexive candidate, or server reflexive candidate only after
   media is flowing via the relayed candidate.  This approach obviates
   the need for transport fallback from ICE to raw UDP during call
   setup, and instead works around the problem by using trickle ICE (for
   those endpoints that support it) or re-INVITEs with updated transport
   candidates after call setup has been completed.

7.  Call Hold

   The Offer/Answer model [RFC3264] stipulates that streams are placed
   on hold by setting their direction to "sendonly".  A session is
   placed on hold by doing this for all the streams it contains.  The
   same semantics are also supported by Jingle through the "senders"
   element and its "initiator" and "responder" values (the Jingle
   specification also defines a value of "none", which maps to an a=
   value of "inactive", and a default value of "both", which maps to an
   a= value of "sendrecv").

   The following example shows how the responder would put the call on
   hold (i.e., temporarily stop listening to media sent by the
   initiator) using a Jingle content-modify action and a modified value



Saint-Andre, et al.     Expires January 06, 2016               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


   for the 'senders' attribute (here a value of "responder" is used to
   indicate that the responder might continue to send media, such as
   hold music).

   Example 2: Call hold via 'senders' attribute

   | <iq from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
   |     id='hz73n2l9'
   |     to='romeo@montague.lit/orchard'
   |     type='set'>
   |   <jingle xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:1'
   |           action='content-modify'
   |           initiator='romeo@montague.lit/orchard'
   |           sid='a73sjjvkla37jfea'>
   |     <content creator='initiator'
   |              media='audio'
   |              name='this-is-the-audio-content'
   |              senders='responder'/>
   |   </jingle>
   | </iq>


   In addition to these semantics, however, the Jingle RTP Sessions
   specification [XEP-0167] also defines a more concise way for
   achieving the same end, which consists in sending a "hold" command
   within a "session-info" action, as shown in the following example.

   Example 3: Call hold via session-info action

   | <iq from='juliet@capulet.lit/balcony'
   |     id='xv39z423'
   |     to='romeo@montague.lit/orchard'
   |     type='set'>
   |   <jingle xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:1'
   |           action='session-info'
   |           initiator='romeo@montague.lit/orchard'
   |           sid='a73sjjvkla37jfea'>
   |     <hold xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:rtp:info:1'/>
   |   </jingle>
   | </iq>


   Gateways that receive either of the foregoing hold notifications from
   their Jingle side MUST generate a new offer on their SIP side,
   placing all streams in a "sendonly" state.

   When relaying offers from SIP to XMPP, gateways are not required to
   translate "sendonly" attributes into a "hold" command as this would



Saint-Andre, et al.     Expires January 06, 2016               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


   not always be possible (e.g., when not all streams have the same
   direction).  Additionally, such conversions might introduce
   complications in case further offers placing a session on hold also
   contain other session modifications.

   It is possible that, after one entity has put the other on hold, the
   second entity might put the first entity on hold.  In this case, the
   effective direction would then be "inactive" in SDP and "none" in
   Jingle.

8.  Early Media

   [RFC3959] and [RFC3960] describe a number of scenarios relying on
   "early media".  While similar attempts have also been made for XMPP,
   support for early media is not currently widely supported in Jingle
   implementations.  Therefore, gateways SHOULD NOT forward SDP answers
   from SIP to Jingle until a final response has been received, except
   in cases where the gateway is in a position to confirm specific
   support for early media by the endpoint (one approach to such support
   can be found in [XEP-0269] but it has not yet been standardized).

   Gateways MUST however store early media SDP answers when they are
   sent inside a reliable provisional response.  In such cases, a
   subsequent final response can follow without an actual answer and the
   one from the provisional response will need to be forwarded to the
   Jingle endpoint.

9.  Detecting Endless Loops

   [RFC3261] defines a "Max-Forwards" header that allows intermediate
   entities such as SIP proxies to detect and prevent loops from
   occurring.  The specifics of XMPP make such a prevention mechanism
   unnecessary for XMPP-only environments.  With the introduction of
   SIP-to-XMPP gatewaying, however, it would be possible for loops to
   occur where messages are being repeatedly forwarded from XMPP to SIP
   to XMPP to SIP.  This can happen not only between two endpoints, but
   also with the addition of a third endpoint into the mix (e.g.,
   because one of the two original endpoints forwards a call to a third
   endpoint, thus converting a "spiral" into a loop).












Saint-Andre, et al.     Expires January 06, 2016               [Page 13]

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


   To compensate for the lack of a "Max-Forwards" header in SIP,
   gateways MUST therefore keep track of all SIP transactions and Jingle
   sessions that they are currently serving and they MUST block re-
   entrant messages.  Although the specifics of such tracking are a
   matter of implementation, the broad requirements is to consistently
   translate SIP dialog IDs into Jingle session ID, and vice versa, or
   generate an internal identifier for each session (e.g., by
   concatenating or hashing the combination of the SIP dialog ID and the
   Jingle session ID).

10.  SDP Format-Specific Parameters

   The SDP specification [RFC4566] defines "a=fmtp" attributes for the
   transmission of format-specific parameters as a single transparent
   string.  Such strings can be used to convey either a single value or
   a sequence of parameters, separated by semi-colons, commas, or
   whatever delimiters are chosen by a particular payload type
   specification.

   The Jingle RTP application format [XEP-0167], on the other hand,
   defines a <parameter/> element as follows:

   <parameter name="paramName" value="paramValue"/>


   A sequence of parameters is thus transmitted as an array of distinct
   name/value pairs, at least in the context of the Jingle RTP
   extension.

   These differences make it difficult to devise a generic mechanism
   that accurately translates format parameters from Jingle RTP to SDP
   without the specifics of the payload being known to the gateway.  In
   general this is not a major problem because most of the media type
   definitions supported in existing Jingle implementations follow the
   semicolon-separated parameter model (e.g., typical audio and video
   codecs).  Possible exceptions include:

   o  The RTP Payload for DTMF Digits, Telephony Tones, and Telephony
      Signals (i.e., the "audio/telephone-event" payload type).  As
      noted in Section 2.5.1.1 of [RFC4733], in SDP the "events"
      parameter is assumed to indicate support for DTMF events 0-15 even
      if the parameter is not included; a gateway SHOULD explicitly
      indicate this support in a Jingle parameter with name='events' and
      value='0-15'.

   o  The RTP Payload for Redundant Audio Data (i.e., the "audio/red"
      payload type).  Although this payload type is defined in
      [RFC2198], the SDP representation is specified in Section 4.1.21



Saint-Andre, et al.     Expires January 06, 2016               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


      of [RFC3555] (note that this representation was not updated with
      by [RFC4856]).  In particular, the "pt" parameter can be mapped to
      a=fmtp lines as described in the payload type registration.

   For implementations that wish to provide a general-purpose
   translation method, this specification makes the following
   recommendations:

   1.  Gateways that are aware of the formats in use SHOULD parse all
       format parameters and generate <parameter/> arrays and "a=fmtp"
       values accordingly.

   2.  When translating Jingle RTP to SIP, gateways that have no
       explicit support for the formats that are being negotiated SHOULD
       convert the list of <parameter/> elements into a single string,
       containing a sequence of "name=value" pairs, separated by a semi-
       colon and a space (i.e. "; ").

   3.  When translating SIP to Jingle RTP, gateways that have no
       explicit support for the formats that are being negotiated SHOULD
       tokenize the "a=fmtp" format string using one delimiter from the
       following list: ";", "; ", ",", ", ".  The resulting tokens
       SHOULD then be parsed as "name=value" pairs.  If this process
       does actually yield any such pairs, they SHOULD be used for
       generating the respective <parameter/> elements.  If some of the
       tokens cannot be parsed into a "name=value" pair because they do
       not conform to the convention suggested in [RFC4855], or in case
       the format string could not be tokenized with the above
       delimiters, the remaining strings SHOULD be used as a value for
       the "value" attribute of the <parameter/> element and the
       corresponding "name" attribute SHOULD be left empty.

   Here is a relatively simple example of the foregoing transformations,
   using the aforementioned example of the "audio/telephone-event"
   payload type (wherein the "events" parameter is implicitly named in
   the SDP):

   SDP with format data (audio/telephone-event)

      a=rtpmap:100 telephone-event/8000
      a=fmtp:100 0-15,66,70


   Jingle transformation (audio/telephone-event)

   <parameter name="events" value="0-15,66,70"/>

Internet-Draft    SIP-XMPP Interworking: Media Sessions        July 2015


   A more complicated example would be handling of the "audio/red"
   payload type (wherein the "pt" parameter can be mapped to a=fmtp
   lines as described in [RFC3555]):

   SDP with format data (audio/red)

      m=audio 49170 RTP/AVP 99 0 103
      a=rtpmap:99 RED/8000
      a=fmtp:99 0/103
      a=rtpmap:103 G729D/8000
      a=fmtp:103 annexb=yes


   Jingle transformation (audio/red)

   <parameter name="pt" value="0,103"/>
   <parameter name="annexb" value="yes"/>


11.  Dialog Forking

   The core SIP specification [RFC3261] defines semantics for dialog
   forking.  Such semantics have not been defined for Jingle and need to
   be hidden from XMPP endpoints.

   To achieve this, a SIP-to-XMPP gateway MUST NOT forward more than one
   provisional response on the Jingle side.  Typically they would do so
   only for the first provisional response they receive and ignore the
   rest.  This provisional response SHOULD be forwarded as if it
   originated from a "user@host" address (i.e., a "bare JID")
   corresponding to the AOR URI found in the "From" header of the SIP
   provisional response.  The gateway MUST NOT attempt to translate
   GRUUs into full JIDs because it cannot know at this stage which of
   the dialogs established by these provisional responses will be used
   for the actual session.

   Likewise, a gateway conforming to this specification MUST NOT forward
   more than a single final response received through SIP to the Jingle
   side.  The gateway SHOULD terminate the SIP sessions whose received
   final response was not forwarded to the Jingle side.

   If the payload types and transport candidate can be successfully used
   by both parties, then the initiator acknowledges the session-accept
   action.

   Example 12: XMPP user acknowledges session-accept (F12)

   |   <iq from='romeo@example.net/v3rsch1kk3l1jk'
   |       id='pd1bf839'
   |       to='juliet@example.com/t3hr0zny'
   |       type='result'/>


   The parties now begin to exchange media.  In this case they would
   exchange audio using the Speex codec at a clockrate of 8000 since
   that is the highest-priority codec for the responder (as determined
   by the XML order of the <payloadtype/> children).

   The parties can continue the session as long as desired.

   Eventually, one of the parties (in this case the responder)
   terminates the session.

   Example 13: SIP user ends session (F15)

   Detailed security considerations for session management are given for
   SIP in [RFC3261] and for XMPP in [XEP-0166] (see also [RFC6120]).
   The security considerations provided in [RFC7247] also apply.

   The addition of gateways to the security model of media signaling
   introduces some new risks.  In particular, end-to-end security
   properties (especially confidentiality and integrity) between media
   endpoints that interface through a gateway can be provided only if
   common formats are supported.  Specification of those common formats
   is out of scope for this document and, unfortunately, no generalized
   method for end-to-end encryption of signaling messages has yet been
   defined, even outside of recognized standards development
   organizations (e.g., [RFC3862] and [RFC3923] are not widely
   implemented and Off-the-Record Messaging [OTR] can handle only human-
   readable chat messages, not structured signaling payloads).
