                   Frame Marking RTP Header Extension
                   draft-ietf-avtext-framemarking-02

Abstract

   This document describes a Frame Marking RTP header extension used to
   convey information about video frames that is critical for error
   recovery and packet forwarding in RTP middleboxes or network nodes.
   It is most useful when media is encrypted, and essential when the
   middlebox or node has no access to the media encryption keys.  It is
   also useful for codec-agnostic processing of encrypted or unencrypted
   media, while it also supports extensions for codec-specific
   information.

1.  Introduction

   Many widely deployed RTP [RFC3550] topologies used in modern voice
   and video conferencing systems include a centralized component that
   acts as an RTP switch.  It receives voice and video streams from each
   participant, which may be encrypted using SRTP [RFC3711], or
   extensions that provide participants with private media via end-to-
   end encryption that excludes the switch.  The goal is to provide a
   set of streams back to the participants which enable them to render
   the right media content.  In a simple video configuration, for
   example, the goal will be that each participant sees and hears just
   the active speaker.  In that case, the goal of the switch is to
   receive the voice and video streams from each participant, determine
   the active speaker based on energy in the voice packets, possibly
   using the client-to-mixer audio level RTP header extension, and
   select the corresponding video stream for transmission to
   participants; see Figure 1.

   In this document, an "RTP switch" is used as a common short term for
   the terms "switching RTP mixer", "source projecting middlebox",

                           Figure 1: RTP switch

   In order to properly support switching of video streams, the RTP
   switch typically needs some critical information about video frames
   in order to start and stop forwarding streams.

   o  Because of inter-frame dependencies, it should ideally switch
      video streams at a point where the first frame from the new
      speaker can be decoded by recipients without prior frames, e.g
      switch on an intra-frame.
   o  In many cases, the switch may need to drop frames in order to
      realize congestion control techniques, and needs to know which
      frames can be dropped with minimal impact to video quality.
   o  Furthermore, it is highly desirable to do this in a way which is
      not specific to the video codec.  Nearly all modern video codecs
      share common concepts around frame types.
   o  It is also desirable to be able to do this for SRTP without
      requiring the video switch to decrypt the packets.  SRTP will
      encrypt the RTP payload format contents and consequently this data
      is not usable for the switching function without decryption, which
      may not even be possible in the case of end-to-end encryption of
      private media.

   A comprehensive discussion of SFU considerations around codec
   agnostic selective forwarding of RTP media is described in
   [I-D.aboba-avtcore-sfu-rtp]

   By providing meta-information about the RTP streams outside the
   encrypted media payload an RTP switch can do selective forwarding
   without decrypting the payload.  This document provides a solution to
   this problem.

2.  Key Words for Normative Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  Frame Marking RTP Header Extension

   The solution uses RTP header extensions as defined in [RFC5285].  A
   subset of meta-information from the video stream is provided as an
   RTP header extension to allow an RTP switch to do generic selective
   forwarding of video streams encoded with potentially different video
   codecs.

3.1.  Mandatory Extension

   The following information are extracted from the media payload and
   sent in the Frame Marking RTP header extension.

   o  S: Start of Frame (1 bit) - MUST be 1 in the first packet in a
      frame within a layer; otherwise MUST be 0.
   o  E: End of Frame (1 bit) - MUST be 1 in the last packet in a frame
      within a layer; otherwise MUST be 0.
   o  I: Independent Frame (1 bit) - MUST be 1 for frames that can be
      decoded independent of prior frames, e.g. intra-frame, VPx
      keyframe, H.264 IDR [RFC6184], H.265 CRA/BLA; otherwise MUST be 0.
   o  D: Discardable Frame (1 bit) - MUST be 1 for frames that can be
      dropped, and still provide a decodable media stream; otherwise
      MUST be 0.
   o  B: Base Layer Sync (1 bit) - MUST be 1 if this frame only depends
      on the base layer; otherwise MUST be 0.
   o  TID: Temporal ID (3 bits) - The base temporal layer starts with 0,
      and increases with 1 for each higher temporal layer/sub-layer.
   o  LID: Layer ID (8 bits) - Identifies the spatial and quality layer
      encoded.
   o  TL0PICIDX: Temporal Layer 0 Picture Index (8 bits) - Running index
      of base temporal layer 0 frames when TID is 0.  When TID is not 0,
      this indicates a dependency on the given index.

   The layer information contained in TID and LID convey useful aspects
   of the layer structure that can be utilized in selective forwarding.
   Without further information about the layer structure, these
   identifiers can only be used for relative priority of layers.  They
   convey a layer hierarchy with TID=0 and LID=0 identifying the base
   layer.  Higher values of TID identify higher temporal layers with
   higher frame rates.  Higher values of LID identify higher spatial or
   quality layers with higher resolutions and bitrates.

Internet-Draft                Frame Marking                    July 2016


   With further information, for example, possible future RTCP SDES
   items that convey full layer structure information, it may be
   possible to map these TIDs and LIDs to specific frame rates,
   resolutions and bitrates.  Such additional layer information may be
   useful to forwarding decisions in the RTP switch, but is beyond the
   scope of this memo.  The relative layer information is still useful
   for many selective forwarding decisions even without such additional
   layer information.

   The Frame Marking RTP header extension is encoded using the one-byte
   header or two-byte header as described in [RFC5285].  The one-byte
   header format is shown below and used for examples in this memo.  The
   two-byte header format is used when other two-byte header extensions
   are present in the same RTP packet, since mixing one-byte and two-
   byte extensions is not possible in the same RTP packet.

      a=extmap:3 urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:framemarking

3.4.  Considerations on use

   The header extension values MUST represent what is already in the RTP
   payload.

Internet-Draft                Frame Marking                    July 2016


   When a RTP switch needs to discard a received video frame due to
   congestion control considerations, it is RECOMMENDED that it
   preferably drop frames marked with the "discardable" bit.

   When a RTP switch wants to forward a new video stream to a receiver,
   it is RECOMMENDED to select the new video stream from the first
   switching point (I bit set) and forward the same.  A RTP switch can
   request a media source to generate a switching point for H.264 by
   sending Full Intra Request (RTCP FIR) as defined in [RFC5104], for
   example.

4.  Security Considerations

   In the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP) [RFC3711], RTP
   header extensions are authenticated but not encrypted.  When header
   extensions are used some of the payload type information are exposed
   and is visible to middle boxes.  The encrypted media data is not
   exposed, so this is not seen as a high risk exposure.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document defines a new extension URI to the RTP Compact
   HeaderExtensions sub-registry of the Real-Time Transport Protocol
   (RTP) Parameters registry, according to the following data:
