                    draft-bryant-mpls-rfc6374-sfl-00

Abstract

   This document describes a method of providing flow identification
   information when making RFC6374 performance measurements.  This
   allows RFC6374 measurements to be made on multi-point to point LSPs
   and allows the measurement of flows within an MPLS construct using
   RFC6374.

1.  Introduction

   [I-D.bryant-mpls-flow-ident] describes the requirement for
   introducing flow identities when using RFC6374 [RFC6374] packet Loss
   Measurements (LM).  In summary RFC6374 uses the LM packet as the
   packet accounting demarcation point.  Unfortunately this gives rise
   to a number of problems that may lead to significant packet
   accounting errors in certain situations.  For example:

   1.  Where a flow is subjected to Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)
       treatment packets can arrive out of order with respect to the LM
       packet.

   2.  Where a flow is subjected to ECMP treatment, packets can arrive
       at different hardware interfaces, thus requiring reception of an
       LM packet on one interface to trigger a packet accounting action
       on a different interface which may not be co-located with it.
       This is a difficult technical problem to address with the
       required degree of accuracy.

   3.  Even where there is no ECMP (for example on RSVP-TE, MPLS-TP LSPs
       and PWs) local processing may be distributed over a number of
       processor cores, leading to synchronization problems.

Internet-Draft                 RFC6374 SFL                  October 2015


   4.  Link aggregation techniques may also lead to synchronization
       issues.

   5.  Some forwarder implementations have a long pipeline between
       processing a packet and incrementing the associated counter again
       leading to synchronization difficulties.

   An approach to mitigating these synchronization issue is described in
   [I-D.tempia-ippm-p3m] and
   [I-D.chen-ippm-coloring-based-ipfpm-framework] in which packets are
   batched by the sender and each batch is marked in some way such that
   adjacent batches can be easily recognized by the receiver.

   An additional problem arises where the LSP is a multi-point to point
   LSP, since MPLS does not include a source address in the packet.
   Network management operations require the measurement of packet loss
   between a source and destination.  It is thus necessary to introduce
   some source specific information into the packet to identify packet
   batches from a specific source.

   draft-bryant-mpls-sfl-framework specifies a method of encoding per
   flow instructions in an MPLS label stack using a technique called
   Synonymous Flow Labels (SFL) in which labels which mimic the
   behaviour of other labels provide the packet batch identifiers and
   enable the per batch packet accounting.  This memo specifies how SFLs
   are used to perform RFC6374 performance measurements.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

   The packet format of an RFC6374 Query message using SFLs is shown in
   Figure 1.

                  Figure 1: RFC6734 Query Packet with SFL

   The MPLS label stack is exactly the same as that used for the user
   data service packets being instrumented except for the replacement of
   the appropriate label with an SFL . The RFC6374 measurement message
   consists of the three components, the RFC6374 fixed header as
   specified in [RFC6374] carried over the ACH channel type specified
   the type of measurement being made (currently: loss, delay or loss
   and delay) as specified in RFC6374.

   Two optional TLVs MAY also be carried if needed.  The first is the
   SFL TLV specified in Section 3.1.  This is used to provide the
   implementation with a reminder of the SFL that was used to carry the
   RFC6374 message.  This is needed because a number of MPLS
   implementations do not provide the MPLS label stack to the MPLS OAM
   handler.  This TLV is required if RFC6374 messages are sent over UDP
   (draft-bryant-mpls-RFC6374-over-udp).  This TLV MUST be included

   unless, by some method outside the scope of this document, it is
   known that this information is not needed by the RFC6374 Responder.

   The second set of information that may be needed is the return
   information that allows the responder send the RFC6374 response to
   the Querier.  This is not needed if the response is requested in-band
   and the MPLS construct being measured is a point to point LSP, but
   otherwise MUST be carried.  The return address TLV is defined in
   RFC6378 and the optional UDP Return Object is defined in
   [I-D.ietf-mpls-rfc6374-udp-return-path].

3.1.  RFC6374 SFL TLV

   [Editor's Note we need to review the following in the light of
   further thoughts on the associated signaling protocol(s).  I am
   fairly confident that we need all the fields other than SFL Batch and
   SFL Index.  The Index is useful in order to map between the label and
   information associated with the FEC.  The batch is part of the
   lifetime management process]

   The required RFC6374 SFL TLV is shown in Figure 2.  This contains the
   SFL that was carried in the label stack, the FEC that was used to
   allocate the SFL and the index into the batch of SLs that were
   allocated for the FEC that corresponds to this SFL.

   SPL Index      The index into the list of SFLs that were assigned

   SFL            The SFL used to deliver this packet.  This is an MPLS
                  label which is a component of a label stack entry as
                  defined in Section 2.1 of [RFC3032].

   Reserved       MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receive.

   FEC            The Forwarding Equivalence Class that was used to
                  request this SFL.  This is encoded as per
                  Section 3.4.1 of

   This information is needed to allow for operation with hardware that
   discards the MPLS label stack before passing the remainder of the
   stack to the OAM handler.  By providing both the SFL and the FEC plus
   index into the array of allocated SFLs a number of implementation
   types are supported.

4.  The Application of SFL to other PM Types

   SFL can be used to enable other types of PM in addition to loss.
   Delay, Delay Variation and Throughput may be calculated based on
   measurement results collected through Loss and Delay Measurement test
   sessions.  Further details will be provided in a future version of
   this draft.

5.  Privacy Considerations

   The inclusion of originating and/or flow information in a packet
   provides more identity information and hence potentially degrades the
   privacy of the communication.  Whilst the inclusion of the additional
   granularity does allow greater insight into the flow characteristics
   it does not specifically identify which node originated the packet
   other than by inspection of the network at the point of ingress, or
   inspection of the control protocol packets.  This privacy threat may
   be mitigated by encrypting the control protocol packets, regularly
   changing the synonymous labels and by concurrently using a number of
   such labels.

6.  Security Considerations

   The issue noted in Section 5 is a security consideration.  There are
   no other new security issues associated with the MPLS dataplane.  Any

   control protocol used to request SFLs will need to ensure the
   legitimacy of the request.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is request to allocate a new TLV from the 0-127 range on the
   MPLS Loss/Delay Measurement TLV Object Registry:
