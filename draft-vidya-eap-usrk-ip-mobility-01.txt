Abstract

   EAP [1] is increasingly used for network access authentication in
   various networks.  Also, key generating EAP methods are being adopted
   in various systems for the purposes of cryptographic protection
   between an EAP peer and an enforcement point in the network.  Key
   generating EAP methods produce an MSK and an EMSK in accordance with
   [1].  The MSK is meant for use by the EAP lower layer at the peer and
   the authenticator and is used differently by various lower layers.
   The EMSK hierarchy is defined in [2].  The EMSK hierarchy is meant to

   be extensible to derive keys for various usages.  This document
   defines the key hierarchy and key derivations for using the EMSK
   hierarchy for keying in IP mobility protocols.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  EAP Keying Overview

   EAP-based authentication is being adopted in several networks for
   access control purposes.  Key generating EAP methods are often used
   to allow some key material to be available for cryptographic access
   enforcement in various lower layers.  As defined in [1], key
   generating EAP methods produce a Master Session Key (MSK) and an
   Extended Master Session Key (EMSK) and the MSK is provided to the
   lower layer.  Several lower layers use the MSK in various different
   ways.

   The EMSK hierarchy for EAP is defined in [2].  The EMSK hierarchy is
   meant to be extensible to derive keys for various usages.  In
   accordance with the defined EMSK hierarchy, Usage Specific Root Keys
   (USRK) and Domain Specific Root Keys (DSRK) may be derived from the
   EMSK.  USRKs are meant to be defined for specific usages and the
   scope of the key will be determined by the EAP Server (or the home
   AAA server) of the peer.  On the other hand, the DSRKs are limited in
   scope to a specific domain and are meant to be distributed to local
   AAA servers in different domains.  The DSRK may then be used to
   derive various Domain Specific USRKs (DS-USRK), which are defined for
   specific usages within the domain for which the DSRK is valid.

1.2.  Motivation for EAP-Based Keying in IP Mobility Protocols

   Several IP mobility protocols require cryptographic key material for
   authentication of signaling messages.  When one or more of these
   protocols is used in a system by end devices that perform network
   access authentication using EAP, it is plausible to derive keys for
   use in such mobility protocols using the EMSK key hierarchy.  This
   prevents the need for having any pre-configured key material being
   available for each of these protocols used or running a separate
   security association protocol to establish the necessary keying
   material (e.g. running again an EAP exchange over IKEv2).  The
   assumption in this document is that the mobility service authorizer
   and the access service authorizer as defined in RFC 4640 are the same
   entity (i.e. integrated scenario).

   The need for pre-configured keying material leads to some
   malpractices in practical usage.  For instance, greater the number of
   pre-configured keys required, the more re-use of a single key across
   various usages tend to occur.  This potentially leads to lack of
   appropriate cryptographic independence across various keys derived
   from a given PSK.  Also, PSKs tend to be configured and kept around
   for long periods of time, due to management issues with frequent
   refreshes.  Consequently, it proves to be a disadvantage in several



Narayanan & Giaretta      Expires May 19, 2008                  [Page 3]

Internet-Draft      draft-vidya-eap-usrk-ip-mobility       November 2007


   systems to have to require a PSK to be available between an end node
   and network entities for every application that may be used by the
   end node.

   Based on these motivations, dynamic bootstrapping solutions
   architecture have been defined.  The solution are usually based on
   the AAA infrastructure for ease of credential management.  For
   example, Mobile IPv4 [3] allows derivation of an MN-HA key based on
   an available shared MN-AAA key between the MN and the AAA server.
   Mobile IPv6 [4] recommends the use of IPsec for securing the
   messaging.  In that case, IKEv2 with EAP for client authentication is
   often used as a means for keying IPsec, since EAP allows re-use of
   AAA-based credentials.  However this approach increases the signaling
   overhead and this is not needed as EAP is run twice between the same
   mobile node and the same EAP server, the first time for network
   access authentication and the second time for IKEv2 authentication.
   Similarly, HMIP [5] also recommends the use of IPsec keyed using
   IKEv2 with EAP for client authentication.  Further, FMIPv6 [6] also
   requires protection of signaling messages using symmetric keys
   between a mobile node and an access router.  These symmetric keys may
   be derived using AAA-based mechanisms, in which case, the MN and AAA
   server are expected to share a PSK.

   Since the AAA server responsible for distributing key material for
   mobility agents is the same as the EAP or ERP server that already
   shares key material with the MN, a mechanism of using the EAP-derived
   keys to provide key material for other uses provides a meaningful
   means of avoiding the need for additional PSKs between the MN and AAA
   server or the need of running separate security association
   protocols.  Note that this approach was discussed also within the
   MIP6 bootstrapping design team some time ago; while there was a good
   agreement to specify some optimization in the integrated scenario
   based on key derivation from network access authentication, this was
   not possible due to the lack of a clear EMSK hierarchy definition.
   We think that now such a clear definition exists within the IETF and
   therefore it is the right time to define those bootstrapping
   optimizations.

1.3.  Scope

   This document describes EAP-based key derivations for the following
   protocols - Mobile IPv4, Mobile IPv6, Hierarchical Mobile IPv6, Fast
   Mobile IPv4, Fast Mobile IPv6.  The USRK labels required for these
   protocols as well as derivation of keys needed between the MN and the
   corresponding mobility agents are described.  Further, the properties
   of the various keys and usage guidelines are also specified.  It is,
   however, left to other individual documents to describe the exact
   signaling mechanisms that will trigger this keying process and enable

   key delivery to mobility agents.  Annex A provides an informative
   example on how the derived keys can be used in the context of MIPv4.

   The scope of this document is limited to the protocols listed above.
   Also, the scope is limited to the case where a key generating EAP
   method is used and the EMSK or DSRK holder is deriving the
   appropriate USRKs for the end node and distributing any keys derived
   from the USRKs to appropriate mobility agents.


2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [7].

   This document uses terminology defined in [4], [5], [6], [1] and [2].

   In addition, this document uses the following terms:

   Mobility Agent

      A mobility agent is an entity maintaining state about the location
      of the mobile nodes.  Examples of mobility agents include the
      Mobile IP Home Agent (HA), the HMIP Mobility Anchor Point (MAP),
      the FMIP Previous Access Router (PAR), etc.


3.  Overview of EAP-Based Keying for IP Mobility Protocols

   As described in Section 1.2, there is good reason for bootstrapping
   the keys needed for IP mobility protocols using EAP generated key
   material.  The basic assumption here is that EAP is used for access
   authentication between the mobile node and a AAA server that is also
   responsible for providing or managing keys for the IP mobility
   services provided in the network (i.e. integrated scenario as defined
   in RFC4640).  Alternately, EAP Re-authentication Protocol (ERP) [8]
   may be used between the MN and the ERP Server that is responsible for
   providing key material for IP mobility services.

   For the purpose of this document , the terms "Mobile Node (MN)",
   "Peer" and "End Node" are interchangeably used.

3.1.  Requirements

   The following requirements need to be met in order to use the
   mechanism described here for EAP-based keying of IP mobility
   protocols.

   o  The EMSK or DSRK holder is also the entity responsible for
      deriving any keys required for use between the mobile node and a
      mobility agent.

   o  There must be a secure channel for key transport between the
      mobility agent requesting a Mobility Usage Session Key (MUSK) and
      the AAA server that is deriving and distributing the key.

   starting any IP mobility sessions with one or more mobility agents.
   It is further assumed that a key generating EAP method is used in the
   EAP exchange, resulting in an EMSK being available at the MN as well
   as at the home AAA server.  A Domain Specific Root Key (DSRK) may
   also be available at a local AAA server in accordance with [2].

   When a valid EMSK or DSRK is available, usage specific root keys may
   be derived from those for different uses, in accordance with [2].
   This document proposes the derivation of USRKs that are needed for
   host-based IP mobility protocols.  For each protocol, a separate
   label for root key generation is registered in this document.
   Further, the framework for derivation of integrity and mobility
   session keys is also provided.

               Figure 2: EAP Based IP Mobility Key Hierarchy

   Figure 2 shows the key hierarchy for deriving IP mobility related
   keys from EAP-based keys.  The keys may be derived from the EMSK or
   the DSRK, depending on whether the keys are being derived at the home
   domain or the local domain.

4.1.  Mobility Root Key (MRK) Derivation and Properties

4.1.1.  MRK Derivation

   The Mobility Root Key (MRK) is calculated in accordance with the USRK
   derivation described in [2] as shown below:

   MRK = KDF(Key, Mobility Key Label, Optional Data, Length)

   where,




Narayanan & Giaretta      Expires May 19, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft      draft-vidya-eap-usrk-ip-mobility       November 2007


   Key = EMSK or DSRK

   Mobility Key Label = the specific label defined for the particular IP
   mobility protocol

   Optional Data = NULL

   Length = 2 byte unsigned integer in network byte order of the output
   key length in octets

   The KDF is as defined in [2] and the default PRF used is HMAC-SHA-
   256.  Alternatively, the PRF used MAY be the same as that used by the
   EAP method - using the PRF from the EAP method provides algorithm
   agility.

   The MRK-Name is calculated as follows, in accordance with [2].

   MRK_Name = prf-64( EAP Session-ID, Mobility Key Label ), where prf-64
   is the first 64 bits from the output

   The following mobility key labels are specified in this document.

   o  MIP4: "Mobile IPv4 Root Key"

   o  MIP6: "Mobile IPv6 Root Key"

   o  HMIPv6: "Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Root Key"

   o  FMIPv6: "Fast Mobile IPv6 Root Key"

   Based on the above labels, the following are the specific root keys
   defined for the various IP mobility protocols:

   o  MIP4-RK = KDF (Key, "Mobile IPv4 Root Key", Optional Data, Length)

   o  MIP6-RK = KDF (Key, "Mobile IPv6 Root Key", Optional Data, Length)

   o  HMIP6-RK = KDF (Key, "Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 Root Key", Optional
      Data, Length)

   o  FMIP6-RK = KDF (Key, "Fast Mobile IPv6 Root Key", Optional Data,
      Length)

   where, Optional Data is NULL and length is a 2 byte unsigned integer
   in network byte order of the output key length in octets, as
   described above.

Internet-Draft      draft-vidya-eap-usrk-ip-mobility       November 2007


4.1.2.  MRK Properties

   The MRK has the following properties.  These properties apply to the
   MRK regardless of the parent key used to derive it.

   o  The length of the MRK MUST be at least 64 bytes.

   o  The MRK is to be used only as a root key for the corresponding IP
      mobility protocol and MUST never be used to directly protect any
      data.

   o  The MRK is only used for derivation of MIK and MUSK as specified
      in this document.

   o  The MRK must remain on the MN and the server that derived it and
      MUST NOT be transported to any other entity.

   o  The MRK is cryptographically separate from any other key derived
      from its parent key.

   o  The lifetime of the MRK is never greater than that of its parent
      key.  The MRK is expired when the parent key expires and removed
      from use at that time.

4.2.  Mobility Integrity Key (MIK) Derivation and Properties

4.2.1.  MIK Derivation

   The Mobility Integrity Key (MIK) is the key used to protect any
   exchange between the MN and the server deriving the MRK, to prove
   possession of the MRK and authorize distribution of key material to a
   mobility agent.

   The MIK is derived from the MRK using the prf+ operation defined in
   RFC4306 [9] as follows.

   MIK = prf+ (MRK, "Mobility Integrity Key")

   The PRF used MAY be the same as that used by the EAP method - using
   the PRF from the EAP method provides algorithm agility.  Otherwise,
   the default PRF used is HMAC-SHA-256.

   The MIK name is derived as follows.

   MIK_name = prf-64 (MRK, "MIK Name")

   where prf-64 is the first 64 bits from the output of the PRF.  The
   PRF is the same as that used in the derivation of the MIK.

Internet-Draft      draft-vidya-eap-usrk-ip-mobility       November 2007


4.2.2.  MIK Properties

   The MIK has the following properties.

   o  The length of the MIK depends on the MAC algorithm used in
      protecting the exchange between the MN and the AAA server used to
      prove possession of the MRK.  The MAC algorithm used MAY be
      specified in the corresponding mobility protocol message sent by
      the peer.  The default MAC algorithm is HMAC-SHA-256.

   o  The MIK MUST only be used for authentication of message exchange
      between the MN and the server that derived the MRK.  This exchange
      may occur through the mobility agent.

   o  The MIK MUST NOT be used to derive any other keys.

   o  The MIK must remain on the MN and the server that derived it and
      MUST NOT be transported to any other entity.

   o  The MIK is cryptographically separate from any other keys derived
      from the MRK.

   o  The lifetime of the MIK is never greater than that of its parent
      key.  The MIK is expired when the MRK expires and removed from use
      at that time.

4.3.  Mobility Usage Session Key (MUSK) Derivation and Properties

4.3.1.  MUSK Derviation

   The Mobility Usage Session Key (MUSK) is the key that is delivered to
   a mobility agent for a particular mobility session between the MN and
   the agent.  This key may be used to protect the mobility signaling
   messages between the MN and the mobility agent or to perform IKEv2
   authentication to establish an IPsec security association.  The
   derivation of this key may be triggered by signaling exchange
   specific to the mobility protocol that requires the key and is not
   defined in this document An example of MUSK may be the MN-HA Key as
   used in Mobile IPv4 as shown in Annex A.

   This document only specifies the framework for the MUSK derivation.
   The actual inputs for the derivations are expected to be specified in
   documents that define the actual protocol exchange that leads to the
   derivation.

   The MUSK is derived from the MRK, using the prf+ operation defined in
   RFC4306 [9], as follows.

Internet-Draft      draft-vidya-eap-usrk-ip-mobility       November 2007


   MUSK = prf+ (MRK, "Mobility Usage Session Key", Mobility Agent
   Identity, Optional Data)

   The PRF used MAY be the same as that used by the EAP method - using
   the PRF from the EAP method provides algorithm agility.  Otherwise,
   the default PRF used is HMAC-SHA-256.

   The inclusion of the mobility agent identity ensures the distribution
   of different keys to different mobility agents that the MN may be
   using.  This identity may be in any form as specified by the
   documents that specify the inputs for MUSK derivation in any specific
   IP mobility protocol.  Examples of Mobility Agent Identity are IP
   address, FQDN, etc.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the optional data contain some freshness
   parameter such as a nonce or a sequence number.

   The MUSK name is derived as follows.

   MUSK_name = prf-64 (MRK, "MUSK Name")

   where prf-64 is the first 64 bits from the output of the PRF.  The
   PRF is the same as that used in the derivation of the MUSK.

4.3.2.  MUSK Properties

   A MUSK has the following properties.

   o  The length of the MUSK depends on the MAC algorithm used in
      protecting the intended mobility protocol exchanges between the MN
      and the mobility agent.  The MAC algorithm used MAY be specified
      in the corresponding mobility protocol message sent by the peer or
      may be pre-specified by the specific protocol.  The default MAC
      algorithm is HMAC-SHA-256.

   o  The MUSK is cryptographically separate from any other keys derived
      from the MRK.

   o  The lifetime of the MUSK is less than or equal to that of the MRK.
      It MUST NOT be greater than the lifetime of the MRK.

   o  If a new MRK is derived, subsequent MUSKs must be derived from the
      new MRK.  Previously delivered MUSKs may still be used until the
      expiry of the lifetime.

   o  A given MUSK MUST NOT be shared by multiple mobility agents.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the use of EAP-based keys for IP mobility
   protocol keying.  This provides a means of avoiding the need for
   multiple pre-shared keys being present between the MN and the AAA
   server.  It may provide an optimization in some cases by making the
   key management of the IP mobility protocol simpler, but, that is
   rather a side effect.  The following security considerations must be
   evaluated carefully before choosing EAP-based IP mobility keying
   mechanisms.

   In general, all the security considerations described in [2] apply to
   this document as well.  In addition, the following considerations
   apply.

5.1.  Key Distribution

   The mobility agent is often a different entity from the one that
   acte\d as the NAS or EAP authenticator during the EAP exchange that
   produced the EMSK.  In order to avoid mobility agents obtaining keys
   for mobile nodes that are not requesting any mobility service from
   them, it is recommended that the MUSK be distributed after some
   exchange between the MN and AAA server corresponding to the mobility
   agent in question.  For instance, this may be a mobility protocol
   exchange between the MN and the mobility agent that contains some
   information protected with the MIK, that can be verified by the AAA
   server.  This basically allows peer consent to be verified prior to
   distribution of a given key.

   Without peer consent, it is possible that a MUSK given out is never
   used.  It may be that it does not pose any particular problem in some
   systems, but, that may depend on other factors.  One example is
   whether the distribution of MUSK is in any way related to any
   accounting or billing for the MN.  Verifying peer consent prior to
   MUSK distribution provides better security in such cases.

5.2.  Revocation of Keys

   Once an MUSK is handed out to a mobility agent, it may continue to be
   used until its lifetime expires.  This may be true even if a new EMSK
   is available before that.  However, if the EMSK is revoked for some
   reason and the peer (MN) is no longer given access, continuing to use
   the MUSK may pose a security risk.  In many systems, once the EAP
   credentials or keys are revoked and the peer is no longer allowed to
   access the system, the peer will be denied access to any other
   service in the system as well and hence, the availability of MUSKs at
   a mobility agent may not pose a risk.  But, if the MN is able to use
   the IP mobility service after its EAP key material has been revoked,

   the corresponding MUSKs SHOULD also be revoked.  This places a burden
   on AAA servers in such systems to be stateful about the entities to
   which MUSKs have been handed out and is often undesirable.  However,
   this is assumed to be a rare requirement, since it is expected that
   the peer will automatically be denied any service once its EAP key
   material is revoked.

7.  Annex A - Example of applicability to MIPv4

   The following is an example on how the key derivation procedure
   described in this document can be applied to MIPv4 in order to
   dynamically bootstrap the mobility security association based on the
   key material derived from the network access authentication.  The
   flow is based on current 3GPP2 specifications.

   The description of the steps required follows:

   1.  The MN performs the EAP authentication for network access.  It is
   supposed that the EAP method used in this transaction supports the
   generation of keys.  A MRK for MIPv4 is derived as described in
   Section 4.1.

   2.  The MN may send an Agent Solicitation.

   3.  The FA sends an Agent Advertisement to the MN.

   4.  The MN sends a RRQ message as specified in [3].

   5.  The FA sends the RRQ message via AAA to the AAA server

   6.  The AAA server selects the HA and generates the MUSK as defined
   in Section 4.3.  The MUSK is used as the MN-HA key.

   7.  The MN-HA key is sent to the HA together with the RRQ message.

   8.  The HA replies with a RRP message.

   9.  The AAA server sends the RRP to the FA.

   10.  The FA forwards the RRP to the MN.

   11.  Based on the identity of the HA, the MN generates the MN-HA key
   as defined in Section 4.3 and checks the validity of the RRP.
