   TRILL: Data Label based Tree Selection for Multi-destination Data 
                   draft-ietf-trill-tree-selection-05


Abstract

   TRILL uses distribution trees to deliver multi-destination frames.
   Multiple trees can be used by an ingress RBridge for flows regardless
   of the VLAN, Fine Grained Label (FGL), and/or multicast group of the
   flow. Different ingress RBridges may choose different distribution
   trees for TRILL Data packets in the same VLAN, FGL, and/or multicast
   group. To avoid unnecessary link utilization, distribution trees
   should be pruned based on VLAN and/or FGL and/or multicast
   destination address. If any VLAN, FGL, or multicast group can be sent
   on any tree, for typical fast path hardware, the amount of pruning
   information is multiplied by the number of trees, but there is a
   limited hardware capacity for such pruning information.

   This document specifies an optional facility to restrict the TRILL
   Data packets sent on particular distribution trees by VLAN, FGL,
   and/or multicast group thus reducing the total amount of pruning
   information so that it can more easily be accommodated by fast path
   hardware.

1.  Introduction

1.1. Background Description

   One or more distribution trees, identified by their root nickname,
   are used to distribute multi-destination data in a TRILL campus
   [RFC6325]. The RBridge having the highest tree root priority
   announces the total number of trees that should be computed for the
   campus. It may also specify the list of trees that RBridges need to
   compute using the Tree Identifiers (TREE-RT-IDs) sub-TLV [RFC7176].
   Every RBridge can specify the trees it will use for multi-destination
   TRILL data packets it originates in the Trees Used Identifiers (TREE-
   USE-IDs) sub-TLV and the VLANs or fine grained labels (FGLs
   [RFC7172]) it is interested in are specified in Interested VLANs
   and/or Interested Labels sub-TLVs [RFC7176]. It is suggested that, by
   default, the ingress RBridge uses the distribution tree whose root is
   the closest [RFC6325]. Trees Used Identifiers sub-TLVs are used to
   build the RPF (Reverse Path Forwarding) Check table that is used for
   reverse path forwarding check, Interested VLANs and Interested Labels
   sub-TLVs are used for distribution tree pruning and the multi-
   destination forwarding table with pruning info is built based on that
   RPF Check Table. To reduce unnecessary link loads, each distribution
   tree should be pruned per VLAN/FGL, eliminating branches that have no
   potential receivers downstream as specified in [RFC6325]. Further
   pruning based on Layer 2 or Layer 3 multicast address is also
   possible.

   Defaults are provided but it depends on the implementation how many
   trees are calculated, where the tree roots are located, and which
   tree(s) are to be used by an ingress RBridge. With the increasing 
   demand to use TRILL in data center networks, there are some features
   we can explore for multi-destination frames in the data center use
   case. In order to achieve non-blocking data forwarding, a fat tree
   structure is often used. Figure 1 shows a typical fat tree structure
   based data center network. RB1 and RB2 are aggregation switches and
   RB11 to RB14 are access switches. It is a common practice to
   configure the tree roots to be at the aggregation switches for
   efficient traffic transportation. Then all the ingress RBridges that
   are access switches have the same distance to all the tree roots.

1.2. Terminology Used in This Document

   This document uses the terminology from [RFC6325] and [RFC7172], some
   of which is repeated below for convenience, along with some
   additional terms listed below:

   Campus: Name for a TRILL network, like "bridged LAN" is a name for a
   bridged network. It does not have any academic implication.

2.  Motivations

   In the structure of Figure 1, if we choose to put the tree roots at
   RB1 and RB2, the ingress RBridge (e.g. RB11) would find more than one
   equal cost closest tree root (i.e. RB1 & RB2). An ingress RBridge has
   two options to select the tree root for multi-destination frames:
   choose one and only one as distribution tree root or use ECMP-like
   algorithm to balance the traffic among the multiple trees whose roots

INTERNET DRAFT      Data Label Based Tree Selection            June 2016


   are at the same distance.

   - For the former (one distribution tree root), a single tree used by
   each ingress RBridge, can have the problem of uneven or inefficient
   link usage. For example, if RB11 chooses the tree1 that is rooted at
   RB1 as the distribution tree, the link between RB11 and RB2 will not
   be used for multi-destination frames ingressed by RB11.

   - For the latter (ECMP-Like algorithm), ECMP based tree selection
   results in a linear increase in multicast forwarding table size with
   the number of trees as explained in the next paragraph.

   A multicast forwarding table at an RBridge is normally used to map
   the key of (distribution tree nickname + VLAN) to an index to a list
   of ports for multicast packet replication. The key used for mapping
   is simply the tree nickname when the RBridge does not prune the tree.
   The key could be the distribution tree nickname augmented by the Fine
   Grained Label (FGL) and/or Layer 2 or 3 multicast address when the
   RBridge supports FGL and/or Layer 2 or 3 pruning information.

   For any RBridge RBn, for each VLAN x, if RBn is in a distribution
   tree t used by traffic in VLAN x, there will be an entry of (t, x,
   port list) in the multicast forwarding table on RBn. Typically each
   entry contains a distinct combination of (tree nickname, VLAN) as the
   lookup key. If there are n such trees and m such VLANs, the multicast
   forwarding table size on RBn is n*m entries. If a fine-grained label
   is used [RFC7172] and/or finer pruning is used (for example, VLAN +
   multicast group address is used for pruning), the value of m
   increases. In the larger scale data center, more trees would be
   necessary for better load balancing purpose and this results in an
   increased value for n. In either case, the number of table entries
   n*m will increase dramatically.

   The left hand table in Figure 2 shows an example of the multicast
   forwarding table on RB11 in the Figure 1 topology with 2 distribution
   trees in a campus using typical fast path hardware. The number of
   entries is approximately 2 * 4K in this case. If 4 distribution trees
   are used in a TRILL campus and RBn has 4K VLANs with downstream
   receivers, it consumes 16K table entries. Fast path TRILL multicast
   forwarding tables typically have a size limited by hardware. The
   table entries are a precious resource. In some implementations, the
   table is shared with Layer 3 IP multicast for a total of 16K or 8K
   table entries. Therefore we want to reduce the table size consumed
   for TRILL distribution trees as much as possible and at the same time
   maintain the load balancing among trees.

   In cases where blocks of consecutive VLANs or FGLs can be assigned to
   a tree, the multicast forwarding table could be greatly compressed if

INTERNET DRAFT      Data Label Based Tree Selection            June 2016


   entries could have a Data Label value and mask with the fast path
   hardware doing the longest prefix matching. But few if any fast path
   implementations provide such logic.

   A straightforward way to alleviate the limited table entries problem
   is not to prune the distribution tree. However this can only be used
   in restricted scenarios for the following reasons:

   - Not pruning wastes bandwidth for multi-destination packets. There
   is normally broadcast traffic, like ARP and unknown unicast, that can
   be pruned on VLAN (or FGL) so it is not sent down branches of a
   distribution tree where it is not needed. In addition, if there is a
   lot of Layer 3 multicast traffic, no pruning may result in the worse
   consequence of that user data unnecessarily flooded all over the
   campus. The volume could be very large if certain applications like
   IPTV ("Television" (video) over IP) are supported. More precise
   pruning, such as pruning based on multicast group, may be desirable
   in this case.

   - Not pruning is only useful at pure transit nodes. Edge nodes always
   need to maintain the multicast forwarding table with the key of (tree
   nickname + VLAN (or FGL)) since the edge node needs to decide whether
    and how to replicate the frame to local access ports. It is likely
   that edge nodes are relatively low end switches with a smaller shared
   table size, say 4K, available.

   - Security concerns. VLAN (or FGL) based traffic isolation is a basic
     requirement in some scenarios. No pruning may increase the risk of 
   leakage of the traffic. Misbehaved RBridges may take advantage of
   this leakage of traffic.

   In addition to the multicast table size concern, some silicon does
   not currently support hashing-based tree nickname selection at the
   ingress RBridge but commonly uses VLAN based tree selection. If the
   control plane of the ingress RBridge maps the incoming VLAN x to a
   tree nickname t. Then the data plane will always use tree t for VLAN
   x multi-destination frames. Such an ingress RBridge may choose
   multiple trees to be used for load sharing, it can use one and only
   one tree for each VLAN. If we make sure all ingress RBridges campus-
   wide send VLAN x multi-destination packets only using tree t, then
   there would be no need to store the multicast table entry with the
   key of (tree-other-than-t, x) on any RBridge.

   This document describes the TRILL control plane support for
   distribution tree selection based on VLAN, FGL, and/or multicast
   address to reduce the multicast forwarding table size. It is
   compatible with the silicon implementations mentioned in the previous
   paragraph.

3.  Data Label based Tree Selection

   Data Label (VLAN or FGL) based tree selection can be used as a
   distribution tree selection mechanism, especially when the multicast
   forwarding table size is a concern. This section specifies that
   mechanism and how to extend it so that tree selection can be based on
   multicast group.

3.1. Overview of the Mechanism

   The RBridge that has the highest priority to be a tree root announces
   the tree nicknames and the Data Labels allowed on each tree. Such
   tree to Data Label correspondence announcements can be based on
   static configuration or some predefined algorithm beyond the scope of
   this document. An ingress RBridge selects the tree-VLAN
   correspondence it wishes to use from the list announced by the
   highest priority tree root. It SHOULD NOT transmit VLAN x frame on
   tree y if the highest priority tree root does not say VLAN x is
   allowed on tree y.

   If we make sure a particular VLAN is allowed on one and only one
   tree, we can keep the number of multicast forwarding table entries on
   any RBridge fixed at 4K maximum (or up to 16M in case of fine grained
   label). Take Figure 1 as example, two trees rooted at RB1 and RB2
   respectively. The highest priority tree root appoints the tree1 to
   carry VLAN 1-2000 and tree2 to carry VLAN 2001-4094. With such
   announcement by the highest priority tree root, every RBridge which
   understands the announcement will not send VLAN 2001-4094 traffic on
   tree1 and not send VLAN 1-2000 traffic on tree2. Then no RBridge
   would need to store the entries for tree1/VLAN2001-4094 or
   tree2/VLAN1-2000. Figure 2 shows the multicast forwarding table on an
   RBridge before and after we use VLAN based tree selection. The number
   of entries is reduced by a factor f, f being the number of trees used
   in the campus. In this example, it is reduced from 2*4094 to 4094.
   This affects both transit nodes and edge nodes. The data plane
   encoding does not change.

3.2. APPsub-TLVs Supporting Tree Selection

   Six new APPsub-TLVs that can be carried in the TRILL GENINFO TLV
   [RFC7357] in E-L1FS FS-LSPs [rfc7780] are defined below. The first
   four can be considered analogous to finer granularity versions of the
   Tree Identifiers Sub-TLV and the Trees Used Identifiers Sub-TLV in
   [RFC7176]. Two APPsub-TLVs supporting VLAN based tree selection are
   specified in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. They are used by the highest
   priority tree root to announce the allowed VLANs on each tree in the
   campus and by an ingress RBridge to announce the tree-VLAN
   correspondence it selects from the list announced by the highest
   priority tree root. Two APPsub-TLVs supporting FGL based tree

   selection are specified in Section 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 for the same
   purpose. Sections 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 define two APPsub-TLVs to support
   finer granularity in selecting trees based on multicast group rather

3.2.1. The Tree and VLANs APPsub-TLV

   The RBridge that is the highest priority tree root announces the
   VLANs allowed on each tree with the Tree and VLANs (TREE-VLANS)
   APPsub-TLV. Multiple instances of this sub-TLV may be carried. The
   same tree nicknames may occur in multiple Tree-VLAN RECORDs within
   the same or across multiple sub-TLVs. The sub-TLV format is as
   follows:

                                   1 1 1 1 1 1
               0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5

   value of Length can be used to determine n. If Length is not a
   multiple of 6, the sub-TLV is corrupt and MUST be ignored.

   o  Nickname: The nickname identifying the distribution tree by its
   root.

   o  RESV: 4 bits that MUST be sent as zero and ignored on receipt.

   o  Start.VLAN, End.VLAN: These fields are the VLAN IDs of the allowed
   VLAN range on the tree, inclusive. To specify a single VLAN, the
   VLAN's ID appears as both the start and end VLAN. If End.VLAN is less
   than Start.VLAN the Tree-VLAN RECORD MUST be ignored.

3.2.2. The Tree and VLANs Used APPsub-TLV

   This APPsub-TLV has the same structure as the Tree and VLANs APPsub-
   TLV (TREE-VLANS) specified in Section 3.2.1.  The differences are
   that its APPsub-TLV type is set to tbd2 (TREE-VLANS-USE) and the
   Tree-VLAN correspondences in the Tree-VLAN RECORDs listed are those
   the originating RBridge wants to use for multi-destination packets.
   This APPsub-TLV is used by an ingress RBridge to distribute the tree-
   VLAN correspondence it selects from the list announced by the highest
   priority tree root.

3.2.3. The Tree and FGLs APPsub-TLV

   The RBridge that is the highest priority tree root can use the Tree
   and FGLs (TREE-FGLS) APPsub-TLV to announce the FGLs allowed on each
   tree. Multiple instances of this APPsub-TLV may be carried. The same
   tree nicknames may occur in the multiple Tree-FGL RECORDs within the
   same or across multiple APPsub-TLVs. Its format is as follows:

   This APPsub-TLV has the same structure as the Tree and FGLs APPsub-

   Tree-FGL RECORDs listed are those the originating RBridge wants to
   use for multi-destination packets. This APPsub-TLV is used by an
   ingress RBridge to distribute the tree-FGL correspondence it selects
   from the list announced by the highest priority tree root.

INTERNET DRAFT      Data Label Based Tree Selection            June 2016


3.2.5. The Tree and Groups APPsub-TLV

   Data Label based tree selection is easily extended to (Data Label +
   Layer 2 or 3 multicast group) based tree selection. We can appoint
   multicast group 1 in VLAN 10 to tree1 and appoint group 2 in VLAN 10
   to tree2 for better load sharing. 

   The RBridge that is the highest priority tree root can announce the
   multicast groups allowed on each tree for each data label with the
   Tree and Groups (TREE-GROUPS) APPsub-TLV. Multiple instances of this
   sub-TLV may be carried. The sub-TLV format is as follows:

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Type = tbd5                 |  (2 byte)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      |   Tree Nickname               |  (2 bytes)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |   Group Sub-Sub-TLVs             (variable)
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+....

   o  Type: TRILL GENINFO APPsub-TLV type, set to tbd5 (TREE-GROUPS).

   o  Length: 2 + the length of the Group Sub-Sub TLVs included

   o  Nickname: The nickname identifying the distribution tree by its
   root.

   o  Group Sub-Sub-TLVs: Zero or more of the TLV structures that are
   allowed as sub-TLVs of the GADDR TLV [RFC7176]. Each such TLV
   structure specifies a multicast group and either a VLAN or FGL.
   Although these TLV structure are considered sub-TLVs when they appear
   inside a GADDR TLV, they are technically sub-sub-TLVs when they
   appear inside a TREE-GROUPs APPsub-TLV which is in turn inside a
   TRILL GENINFO TLV [RFC7357].

3.2.6. The Tree and Groups Used APPsub-TLV

   This APPsub-TLV has the same structure as the Tree and GROUPs APPsub-
   TLV (TREE-GROUPS) specified in Section 3.2.5.  The only difference is
   that its APPsub-TLV type is set to tbd6 (TREE-GROUPS-USE), and the
   tree and multicast groups listed in this sub-TLV are those the
   originating RBridge wants to use for multi-destination packets. This
   APPsub-TLV is used by an ingress RBridge to distribute the tree-group
   correspondence it selects from the list announced by the highest
   priority tree root.

INTERNET DRAFT      Data Label Based Tree Selection            June 2016


3.3. Detailed Processing

   The highest priority tree root RBridge MUST include all the necessary
   tree related sub-TLVs defined in [RFC7176] as usual in its E-L1FS FS-
   LSP and MAY include the Tree and VLANs Sub-TLV (TREE-VLANs) and/or
   Tree and FGLs Sub-TLV (TREE-FGLs) in its E-L1FS FS-LSP [RFC7780]. In
   this way it MAY indicate that each VLAN and/or FGL is only allowed on
   one or some other number of trees less than the number of trees being
   calculated in the campus in order to save table space in the fast
   path forwarding hardware.

   An ingress RBridge that understands the TREE-VLANs APPsub-TLV SHOULD
   select the tree-VLAN correspondences it wishes to use and put them in
   TREE-VLAN-USE APPsub-TLVs. If there are multiple tree nicknames
   announced in TREE-VLANs Sub-TLV for a VLAN x, ingress RBridge chooses
   one of them if it supports this feature. For example, the ingress
   RBridge may choose the closest (minimum cost) root among them. How to
   make such a choice is out of the scope of this document. It may be
   desirable to have some fixed algorithm to make sure all ingress RBs
   choose the same tree for VLAN x in this case. Any single Data Label
   that the ingress RBridge is interested in should be related to only
   one tree ID in TREE-VLAN-USE to minimize the multicast forwarding
   table size on other RBridges but as long as the Data Label is related
   to less than all the trees being calculated, it will reduce the
   burden on the forwarding table size.

   When an ingress RBridge encapsulates a multi-destination frame for
   Data Label x, it SHOULD use a tree nickname that it selected
   previously in TREE-VLAN-USE or TREE-FGL-USE for Data Label x.
   However, that may not be possible because either (1) the RBridge may
   not have advertised such TREE-VLAN-USE or TREE-FGL-USE APPsub-TLVs,
   in which case it can use any tree that has been advertised as
   permitted for the Data Label by the highest priority tree root
   RBridge, or (2) the tree or trees it advertised might be unavailable
   due to failures.

   If RBridge RBn does not perform pruning, it builds the multicast
   forwarding table as specified in [RFC6325].

   If RBn prunes the distribution tree based on VLANs, RBn uses the
   information received in TREE-VLAN-USE APPsub-TLVs to mark the set of
   VLANs reachable downstream for each adjacency and for each related
   tree. If RBn prunes the distribution tree based on FGLs, RBn uses the
   information received in TRILL-FGL-USE APPsub-TLVs to mark the set of
   FLGs reachable downstream for each adjacency and for each related
   tree.

   Logically, an ingress RBridge that does not support VLAN/FGL based

INTERNET DRAFT      Data Label Based Tree Selection            June 2016


   tree selection is equivalent to the one that supports it and
   announces all the combination pair of tree-id-used and interested-
   vlan/interested-fgl as TREE-VLAN-USE.

3.4. Failure Handling

   This section discusses failure of a distribution tree root for the
   cases where that is not the highest priority root and the case where
   it is the highest priority root. It also discusses some other
   transient error conditions.

   Failure of a tree root that is not the highest priority: It is the
   responsibility of the highest priority tree root to inform other
   RBridges of any change in the allowed tree-VLAN correspondence. When
   the highest priority tree root learns the root of tree t has failed,
   it should re-assign the VLANs allowed on tree t to other trees or to
   a tree replacing the failed one.

   Failure of the highest priority tree root: It is suggested that the
   second highest priority tree root be pre-configured with the proper
   knowledge of the tree-VLAN correspondence allowed when the highest
   priority tree root fails. The information announced by the second
   priority tree root would be in the link state of all RBridges but
   would not take effect unless the RBridge noticed the failure of the
   highest priority tree root. When the highest priority tree root
   fails, the former second priority tree root will become the highest
   priority tree root of the campus. When an RBridge notices the failure
   of the original highest priority tree root, it can immediately use
   the stored information announced by the original second priority tree
   root. It is suggested that the tree-VLAN correspondence information
   be pre-configured on the second highest priority tree root to be the
   same as that on the highest priority tree root for the trees other
   than the highest priority tree itself. This can minimize the change
   to multicast forwarding tables in the case of highest priority tree
   root failure. For a large campus, it may make sense to pre-configure
   this information in a similar way on the third, fourth, or even lower
   priority tree root RBridges.

   In some transient conditions or in case of misbehavior by the highest
   priority tree root, an ingress RBridge may encounter the following
   scenarios:

   - No tree has been announced for which VLAN x frames are allowed.

   - An ingress RBridge is supposed to transmit VLAN x frames on tree t,
   but root of tree t is no longer reachable.

   For the second case, an ingress RBridge may choose another reachable

INTERNET DRAFT      Data Label Based Tree Selection            June 2016


   tree root which allows VLAN x according to the highest priority tree
   root announcement. If there is no such tree available, then it is the
   same as the first case above. Then the ingress RBridge should be
   'downgraded' to a conventional RBridge with behavior as specified in
   [RFC6325]. A timer should be set to allow the temporary transient
   stage to complete before the change of responsive tree or 'downgrade'
   takes effect. The value of timer should be set to at least the LSP
   flooding time of the campus.

4.  Backward Compatibility

   RBridges MUST include the TREE-USE-IDs and INT-VLAN sub-TLVs in their
   LSPs when required by [RFC6325] whether or not they support the new
   TREE-VLAN-USE or TREE-FGL-USE sub-TLVs specified by this draft.

   RBridges that understand the new TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLV sent from
   another RBridge RBn should use it to build the multicast forwarding
   table and ignore the TREE-USE-IDs and INT-VLAN sub-TLVs sent from the
   same RBridge. TREE-USE-IDs and INT-VLAN sub-TLVs are still useful for
   some purposes other than building multicast forwarding table (E.g.
   RPF table building, spanning tree root notification, etc.) If the
   RBridge does not receive TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLVs from RBn, it uses the
   conventional way described in [RFC6325] to build the multicast
   forwarding table.

   For example, there are two distribution trees, tree1 and tree2, in
   the campus. RB1 and RB2 are RBridges that use the new APPsub-TLVs
   described in this document. RB3 is an old RBridge that is compatible
   with [RFC6325]. Assume RB2 is interested in VLANs 10 and 11 and RB3
   is interested in VLANs 100 and 101. Hence RB1 receives ((tree1,
   VLAN10), (tree2, VLAN11)) as a TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLV and (tree1,
   tree2) as a TREE-USE-IDs sub-TLV from RB2 on port x. And RB1 receives
   (tree1) as a TREE-USE-IDs sub-TLV and no TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLV from
   RB3 on port y. RB2 and RB3 announce their interested VLANs in an INT-
   VLAN sub-TLV as usual. Then RB1 will build the entry of (tree1,
   VLAN10, port x) and (tree2, VLAN11, port x) based on RB2's LSP and
   the mechanism specified in this document. RB1 also builds entries of
   (tree1, VLAN100, port y), (tree1, VLAN101, port y), (tree2, VLAN100,
   port y), (tree2, VLAN101, port y) based on RB3's LSP in conventional
   way. The multicast forwarding table on RB1 with merged entry would be
   like the following.

            |   tree 2     | 101 | y       |
            +--------------+-----+---------+

   As expected, that table is not as small as the one where every
   RBridge supports the new TREE-VLAN-USE sub-TLVs. The worst case in a
   hybrid campus is the number of entries equal to the number in current
   practice which does not support VLAN based tree selection. Such an
   extreme case happens when the interested VLAN set from the new
   RBridges is a subset of the interested VLAN set from the old
   RBridges.

   Data Label and multicast group based tree selection is compatible
   with the current practice. Its effectiveness increases with more
   RBridge supporting this feature in the TRILL campus.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not change the general RBridge security
   considerations of the TRILL base protocol. The APPsub-TLVs specified
   can be secured using the IS-IS authentication feature [RFC5310]. See 
   Section 6 of [RFC6325] for general TRILL security considerations. 


6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign six new TRILL APPsub-TLV type codes from
   the range less than 255 as specified in Section 3 and update the
   "TRILL APPsub-TLV Types under IS-IS TLV 251 Application Identifier 1"
   Registry on the IANA TRILL Parameters web page as shown below.
