                Expiring Aggressively Those HTTP Cookies
                     draft-thomson-http-omnomnom-00

Abstract

   HTTP Cookies that are sent over connections without confidentiality
   and integrity protection are vulnerable to theft.  Such cookies
   should be expired aggressively.

1.  Introduction

   HTTP cookies [RFC6265] provide a means of persisting server state
   between multiple requests.  This feature is widely used on both HTTP
   [RFC7230] and HTTPS [RFC2818] requests.

   The authority for "http://" resources (see Section 9.1 of [RFC7230])
   derives from insecure sources: notably the network and the DNS
   (absent DNSSEC).  This situation might change over time.  As
   persistent state, cookies create a way for an attacker to link
   requests.  The information that a cookie holds might also be valuable
   to that attacker in some way.

   To limit the effectiveness of attacks on cleartext communications
   [RFC7258], user agents are encouraged to limit the persistence of
   cookies that are set over insecure connections.

1.1.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  Expire Cookies

   Cookies that are set using insecure channels (i.e., HTTP over
   cleartext TCP), MUST have a short time limit on the time that they
   are persisted.  For instance, such cookies might only persist until
   the user closes their browser.

   If a user agent detects a change in network conditions it SHOULD
   remove any cookies that were established using insecure channels.

   o  In the investigation into this change, it was suggested that
      cookies without the "Secure" flag might be given the same
      treatment.  However, this resulted in a far greater number of
      cookies being affected and some interoperability problems as a
      result.

   o  This change might be limited to cookies that are set in third-
      party contexts.  See [I-D.west-first-party-cookies].

      Limiting access to third-party cookies in this fashion could have
      the secondary effect of encouraging providers of third-party
      content to move to HTTPS.  This removes that content as a barrier
      to the adoption of HTTPS for the sites that include that content.

3.  Security Considerations

   This document describes an improvement that could be a security
   improvement.  However, this is not without risks.  For cookies that
   are used as a substitute for logins, more regular clearing of a login
   cookie could expose the primary authentication token (for instance, a
   password) to more network attackers as a result of being entered more
   often.

   Clearing login tokens could also cause a degree of user annoyance, as
   login information is lost.  Such annoyance manifests in many subtle
   ways.

   Limiting the change to third-party contexts as suggested above might
   reduce these risks, though with lesser overall impact.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
