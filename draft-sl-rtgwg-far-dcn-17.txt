   Generic Fault-Avoidance Routing Protocol for Data Center Networks
                       draft-sl-rtgwg-far-dcn-17

Abstract

   This document describes a generic routing method and protocol for a
   regular data center network, named the Fault-Avoidance Routing (FAR)
   protocol.  The FAR protocol provides a generic routing method for all
   types of regular topology network architectures that have been
   proposed for large-scale cloud-based data centers over the past few
   years.  The FAR protocol is designed to leverage any regularity in
   the topology and compute its routing table in a concise manner.  Fat-
   tree is taken as an example architecture to illustrate how the FAR
   protocol can be applied in real operational scenarios.

1.  Introduction

   In recent years, with the rapid development of cloud computing
   technologies, the widely deployed cloud services, such as Amazon EC2
   and Google search, bring about huge challenges to data center
   networking (DCN).  Today's cloud-based data centers (DCs) require
   large-scale networks with larger internal bandwidth and smaller
   transfer delay.  However, conventional networks cannot meet such
   requirements due to limitations in their network architecture.  In
   order to satisfy the requirements of cloud computing services, many
   new network architectures have been proposed for data centers, such
   as Fat-tree, MatrixDCN[MatrixDCN], and BCube[BCube].  These new
   architectures can support non-blocking large-scale datacenter
   networks with more than tens of thousands of physical servers.

   All of these architectures have regular topologies, which are common
   features.  The regular topology refers to the network topology
   structure with obvious regularity and symmetry, which is conducive to
   automatic configuration of the network, such as the Fat-tree network.
   In a regular topology, each network node such as a switch or router
   can be addressed by its location and through a node's address, the
   node's connections to its neighbors in a network can be determined,
   and furthermore, the route to the node from other nodes in the
   network can be determined.  So nodes can compute route entries
   without learning topology.

   This document describes a generic routing method and protocol, the
   Fault-Avoidance Routing (FAR) protocol, for DCNs.  This method
   leverages the regularity in the topologies of data center networks to
   simplify routing learning and accelerate the query of routing tables.
   This routing method has a better fault tolerance and can be applied
   to any DCN with a regular topology.

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


   FAR is not a routing protocol to replace generic routing protocols
   such as OSPF(Open Shortest Path First)[RFC2328] and IS-
   IS(Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System).  It cannot be used in
   general local networks whose topological structures are arbitrary,
   and whose scales are also not very large.  OSPF and IS-IS work very
   well in such a network.  But in a large-scale network with regular
   topology, FAR has better performance.  Compared with OSPF and IS-IS,
   FAR has shorter time of network convergence and lower PDU(Protocol
   Data Unit) overhead.  Furthermore, FAR requires less computing and
   storage resources, which lets FAR routers to run at a lower cost of
   production than the generic routers.

   In addition, for each type of network architecture, researchers
   designed a routing algorithm according to the features of its
   topology.  Because these routing algorithms are different and lack
   compatibility with each other, it is very difficult to develop a
   routing protocol for network routers supporting multiple routing
   algorithms.  FAR has better adaptability than these specified routing
   methods.

   FAR consists of three components, i.e., link state learning unit,
   routing table building unit and routing table querying unit.  In the
   link state learning unit, FAR exchanges link failures among routers
   to establish a consistent knowledge of the entire network.  In this
   stage, the regularity in topology is exploited to infer failed links
   and routers.  In the routing table building unit, FAR builds up two
   routing tables, i.e., a basic routing table (BRT) and a negative
   routing table (NRT), for each router according to the network
   topology and link states.  In the last component, routers forward
   incoming packets by looking up the two routing tables.  The matched
   entries in BRT minus the matched entries in NRT are the final route
   entries to be used to forward an incoming packet.

   This document describes a protocol developed by ZTE and Beijing
   Jiaotong University.  It is just presented here to record the work
   and to make it available for use in later IETF work if desirable.

   The remainder of this draft is organized as follows.  The problem to
   be addressed by FAR is described in Section 3.  The framework of FAR
   routing protocol is described in Section 4.  Section 5 and 6
   introduce FAR's data format FAR and modules in detail.  Section 7
   describe how FAR works by finite state machine (FSM).  In Section 8,
   we discussed how FAR works with variable network architectures.
   Section 9 takes Fat-tree network as an example to illuminate how FAR
   works.

   The problem to be addressed by FAR as proposed in this draft is
   described in this section.  The expansion of Cloud data center
   networks has brought significant challenges to the existing routing
   technologies.  FAR mainly solves a series of routing problems faced
   by large-scale data center networks.

3.1.  The Impact of Large-scale Networks on Route Calculation

   In a large-scale cloud data center network, there may be thousands of
   routers.  Running OSPF or IS-IS in such network will encounter these
   two challenges:

   (1) Network convergence time would be too long, which will cause a
   longer time to elapse for creating and updating the routes.  The
   response time to network failures may be excessively long;

   (2) High resource consumption.  Since a large number of routing
   protocol packets need to be sent, it causes the routing information
   consuming too much network bandwidth and CPU(central processing unit)
   resources, and easily leads to packet loss and makes the challenge
   (1) more prominent.

   In order to solve these two challenges, a common practice is to
   partition a large network into some small areas, where the route
   calculation runs independently within different areas.  However,
   nowadays the cloud data centers typically require very large internal
   bandwidth.  To meet this requirement, a large number of parallel
   equivalent links are deployed in a network, such as a Fat-tree
   network.  Partitioning such a network will affect the utilization of
   routing algorithm on equivalent multi-path and reduce internal
   network bandwidth requirements.

   In the FAR routing calculation process, a Basic Routing Table (BRT)
   is built on local network topology leveraging the regularity of the
   network topologies.  In addition to BRT, FAR also builds a Negative
   Routing Table (NRT).  FAR gradually builds NRT in the process of
   learning network link failure information, which does not require
   learning a complete network fault information.  FAR does not need to
   wait for the completion of the network convergence in the process of
   building these two tables.  Therefore, it avoids the problem of
   excessive network convergence overheads in the route calculation
   process.  In addition, FAR only needs to exchange a small amount of
   link change information between routers, and hence consumes less
   network bandwidth.

3.2.  Issues of Conventional Routing Methods in a Large-scale Network
      with Giant Number Nodes of Routers

   There are many real world scenario where tens of thousands of
   nodes(or much more nodes) need to be deployed in a flat area, such as
   infiniband routing and switching system, high-performance computer
   network, and many IDC(Internet Data Center) networks in China.  The
   similar problems have been existed long ago.  People have solved the
   problems through similar solutions, such as the traditional regular

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


   topology-based RFC3619[RFC3619] protocol, the routing protocols of
   infiniband routing and switching system, and high-performance
   computer network routing protocol.
   Infiniband defines a switch-based network to interconnect processing
   nodes and the I/O nodes.  Infiniband can support very large scale
   networks, use the regularity in topology to simplify its routing
   algorithm, which is just the same to what we do in FAR.

   Why OSPF and IS-IS do not work well in a large-scale network with
   giant number nodes of routers?

   As we know, the OSPF protocol uses multiple databases, more
   topological exchange information (as seen in the following example)
   and complicated algorithm.  It requires routers to consume more
   memory and CPU processing capability.  But the processing rate of CPU
   on the protocol message per second is very limited.  When the network
   expands, CPU will quickly approach its processing limits, and at this
   time OSPF can not continue to expand the scale of the management.
   The SPF(Shortest Path First) algorithm itself does not thoroughly
   solve these problems.

   On the contrary, the FAR protocol does not need to calculate SPF,
   which saves calculation time and resources, so FAR does not have the
   convergence time delay and the additional CPU overheads, which SPF
   requires.  Because in the initial stage, FAR already knows the
   regular information of the whole network topology and does not need
   to periodically do SPF operation.

   One of the examples of "more topological exchange information":
   In the OSPF protocol, LSA(Link-State Advertisement) floods every 1800
   seconds.  Especially in the larger network, the occupation of CPU and
   band bandwidth will soon reach the router's performance bottleneck.
   In order to reduce these adverse effects, OSPF introduced the concept
   of Area, which still has not solved the problem thoroughly.  By
   dividing the OSPF Area into several areas, the routers in the same
   area do not need to know the topological details outside their area.
   (In comparison with FAR, after OSPF introducing the concept of Area,
   the equivalent paths cannot be selected in the whole network scope)

   OSPF can achieve the following results by Area : 1) Routers only need
   to maintain the same link state databases as other routers within the
   same Area, without the necessity of maintaining the same link state
   database as all routers in the whole OSPF domain.  2) The reduction
   of the link state databases means dealing with relatively fewer LSA,
   which reduces the CPU consumption of routers; 3) The large number of
   LSAs flood only within the same Area.  But, its negative effect is
   that the smaller number of routers which can be managed in each OSPF
   area.  On the contrary, because FAR does not have the above



Bin Liu, et al.           Expires June 3, 2022                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


   disadvantages, FAR can also manage large-scale network even without
   dividing Areas.

   The aging time of OSPF is set in order to adapt to routing
   transformation and protocol message exchange happened frequently in
   the irregular topology.  Its negative effect is: when the network
   does not change, the LSA needs to be refreshed every 1800 seconds to
   reset the aging time.  In the regular topology, as the routings are
   fixed, it does not need the complex protocol message exchange and
   aging rules to reflect the routing changes, as long as LFA mechanism
   in the FAR is enough.

   Compared with the LSVR(Link State Vector Routing) protocol, the LSVR
   protocol has no special requirements for the network topology
   structure, however, the FAR draft is applicable to the regular
   topology network architecture and simplifies unnecessary processing.
   It is a solution proposed to greatly improve the routing efficiency
   of the regular network topology.  The FAR solution is more efficient
   than the general methods such as LSVR in regular topology.

   Therefore, in FAR, we can omit many unnecessary processing and the
   packet exchange.  The benefits are fast convergence speed and much
   larger network scale than other dynamic routing protocol.  Now there
   are some successful implementations of simplified routings in the
   regular topology in the HPC(High Performance Computing) environment.
   Conclusion: As FAR needs few routing entries and the topology is
   regular, the database does not need to be updated regularly.  Without
   the need for aging, there is no need for CPU and bandwidth overhead
   brought by LSA flood every 30 minutes, so the expansion of the
   network has no obvious effect on the performance of FAR, which is
   contrary to OSPF.

   Comparison of convergence time: The settings of OSPF spf_delay and
   spf_hold_time can affect the change of convergence time.  The
   convergence time of the network with 2480 nodes is about 15-20
   seconds; while the FAR does not need to calculate the SPF, so there
   is no such convergence time.
   These issues still exist in rapid convergence technology of OSPF
   ,ISIS (such as I-SPF, Incremental SPF) and LSVR.  The convergence
   speed and network scale constraint each other.  FAR does not have the
   above problems, and the convergence time is almost negligible.
   Can FRR(Fast Reroute) solve these problems?  IP FRR has some
   limitations.  The establishment of IP FRR backup scheme will not
   affect the original topology and traffic forwarding which are
   established by protocol, however, we can not get the information of
   whereabouts and status when the traffic is switched to an alternate
   next hop.

3.3.  Network Addressing Issues

   Routers are typically configured with multiple network interfaces,
   each connected to a subnet.  OSPF and other routing algorithms
   require that each interface of a router must be configured with an IP
   address.  A large-scale data center network may contain thousands of
   routers and each router has dozens of network interfaces, thus, there
   are tens of thousands of IP addresses needed to be configured in a
   data center.  It will be very complex to configure and manage a large
   number of network interfaces and will be difficult to troubleshoot
   network problems, then network maintenance will be costly and error-
   prone.

   In FAR, the device position information is encoded in the IP address
   of the router.  Each router only needs to be assigned a unique IP
   address according its location, which greatly solves complex network
   addressing issues in large-scale networks.

3.4.  Big Routing Table Issues

   There are a large number of subnets in the large-scale data center
   network.  A router may build a routing entry for each subnet, and
   therefore the size of routing tables on each router may be very
   large.  It will increase a router's cost and reduce the querying
   speed of the routing table.

   FAR uses two measures to reduce the size of its routing tables: a)It
   builds a BRT on the regularity of the network topologies; b)It
   introduces a new routing table, i.e., a NRT.  In this way FAR can
   reduce the size of routing tables to only a few dozen routing
   entries.

3.5.  Adaptivity Issues for Routing Algorithms

   To implement efficient routing in large-scale datacenters, besides
   FAR, some other routing methods are proposed for some specific
   network architectures, such as Fat-tree and BCube.  These routing
   methods are different(from both design and implementation viewpoints)
   and not compatible with the conventional routing methods, which
   brings big troubles to network equipment providers to develop new
   routers supporting various new routing methods.

   FAR is a generic routing method.  With slight modification, FAR
   method can be applied to most of regular datacenter networks.
   Furthermore, the structure of routing tables and querying a routing
   table in FAR are the same as conventional routing method.  If FAR is
   adopted, the workload of developing a new type of router will be
   significantly decreased.

3.6.  Virtual Machine Migration Issues

   Supporting VM migration is very important for cloud-based datacenter
   networks.  However, in order to support layer-3 routing, routing
   methods including OSPF and FAR require limiting VM migration within a
   subnet.  For this paradox, the mainstream methods still utilize
   layer-3 routing on routers or switches, transmit packets encapsulated
   by IPinIP or MACinIP between hosts by tunnels passing through network
   to the destination access switch, and then extract original packet
   out and send it to the destination host.

   By utilizing the aforementioned methods, FAR can be applied to Fat-
   tree, MatrixDCN or BCube networks for supporting VM migration in
   entire network.

4.  The FAR Framework

   FAR requires that a DCN has a regular topology, and network devices,
   including routers, switches, and servers, are assigned IP addresses
   according to their locations in the network.  In other word, we can
   locate a device in the network according to its IP address.

   FAR is a distributed routing method.  In order to support FAR, each
   router needs to have a routing module that implements the FAR
   algorithm.  FAR algorithm is composed of three parts, i.e., link-
   state learning, routing table building and routing table querying, as
   shown in Fig. 1.

   Link-state learning is responsible for a router to detect the states
   of its connected links and learn the states of all the other links in
   the entire network.  The second part builds two routing tables, a
   basic routing table (BRT) and an negative routing table (NRT),
   according to the learned link states in the first part.  The third
   part queries the BRT and the NRT to decide a next forwarding hop for
   the received (ingress) packets.

5.  Data Format

   Some data tables are maintained on each router in FAR.  They are:

   Neighbor Device Table (NDT): To store neighbor routers and related
   links.

5.2.  Messages

   Some protocol messages are exchanged between routers in FAR.

   Hello Message: This message is exchanged between neighbor routers to
   learn adjacency.

   Device Announcement (DA): Synchronize the knowledge of routers
   between routers.

   Link Failure Announcement (LFA): Synchronize link failures between
   routers.

   Device and Link Request (DLR): When a router starts, it requests the
   knowledge of routers and links from its neighbors by a DLR message.

   A FAR Message is directly encapsulated in an IP packet.  The protocol
   field of IP header indicates an IP packet is an FAR message.

   The four types of FAR messages have same format of packet header,
   called FAR header (as shown in Figure 2).

   1.Except for FAR header, DLR has no additional fields.


6.  FAR Modules

6.1.  Neighbor and Link Detection Module(M1)

   M1 is responsible for sending and receiving Hello messages, and
   detecting directly-connected links and neighbor routers.  Each Hello
   message is encapsulated in an IP packet.  M1 sends Hello messages
   periodically to all the active router ports and receives Hello
   messages from its neighbor routers.  M1 detects neighbor routers and
   directly-connected links according to received Hello Messages and
   stores these neighbors and links into a Neighbor Devices Table (NDT).
   Additionally, M1 also stores neighbor routers into an All Devices
   Table (ADT).

6.2.  Device Learning Module(M2)

   M2 is responsible for sending, receiving, and forwarding device
   announcement (DA) messages, learning all the routers in the whole
   network, and deducing faulted routers.  When a router starts, it
   sends a DA message announcing itself to its neighbors and a DLR
   message requesting the knowledge of routers and links from its
   neighbors.  If M2 module of a router receives a DA message, it checks
   whether the router encapsulated in the message is in an ADT.  If the
   router is not in the ADT, M2 puts this router into the ADT and
   forwards this DA message to all the active ports except for the
   incoming one, otherwise, M2 discards this message directly.  If M2
   module of a router receives a DLR message, it replies a DA message
   that encapsulates all of the learned routers.

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


6.3.  Invisible Neighbor and Link Failure Inferring Module(M3)

   M3 is responsible for inferring invisible neighbors of the current
   router by means of the ADT.  If the link between a router A and its
   neighbor B breaks, which results in that M1 module of A cannot detect
   the existence of B, then B is an invisible neighbor of A.  Since a
   device's location is coded into its IP address, it can be judged
   whether two routers are adjacent, according to their IP addresses.
   Based on this idea, M3 infers all of the invisible neighbors of the
   current router and the related link failures.  The results are stored
   into an NDT.  Moreover, link failures also are added into a link-
   failure table (LFT).  LFT stores all of the failed links in the
   entire network.

6.4.  Link Failure Learning Module(M4)

   M4 is responsible for sending, receiving and forwarding link failure
   announcement (LFA) and learning all the link failures in the whole
   network.  M4 broadcasts each newly inferred link failure to all the
   routers in the network.  Each link failure is encapsulated in a LFA
   message and one link failure is broadcasted only once.  If a router
   receives a DLR request from its neighbor, it will reply a LFA message
   that encapsulates all the learned link failures through M4 module.
   If M4 receives a LFA message, it checks whether the link failure
   encapsulated in the message is in a LFT by comparing two link ends
   and timestamp.  If the link failure is not in the LFT or timestamp is
   different, M4 puts this link failure into the LFT (or update
   timestamp only) and forwards this LFA message to all the active ports
   except for the incoming one, otherwise, M4 discards this message
   directly.

   There is a special case a router will rebroadcast a link failure.  If
   a router receives a data packet and must forward the packet going
   ahead to destination through a failed link, it means some previous
   router should avoid this failed link according to its NRT but it
   doesn't.  In this case, maybe the previous router missed the LFA
   message of the link failure due to some uncertain reasons.  So the
   forwarding router rebroadcasts the LFA message.

6.5.  BRT Building Module(M5)

   M5 is responsible for building a BRT for the current router.  By
   leveraging the regularity in topology, M5 can calculate the routing
   paths for any destination without the knowledge of the topology of
   whole network, and then build the BRT based on an NDT.  Since the IP
   addresses of network devices are continuous, M5 only creates one
   route entry for a group of destination addresses that have the same
   network prefix by means of route aggregation technology.  Usually,

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


   the size of a BRT is very small.  The detail of how to build a BRT is
   described in section 5.

6.6.  NRT Building Module(M6)

   M6 is responsible for building a NRT for the current router.  Because
   M5 builds a BRT without considering link failures in network, the
   routing paths calculated by the BRT cannot avoid failed links.  To
   solve this problem, a NRT is used to exclude the routing paths that
   include some failed links from the paths calculated by a BRT.  M6
   calculate the routing paths that include failed links and stored them
   into the NRT.  The details of how to build a NRT is described in
   section 5.

6.7.  Routing Table Lookup(M7)

   M7 is responsible for querying routing tables and selecting the next
   hop for forwarding the packets.  Firstly, M7 takes the destination
   address of a forwarding packet as a criterion to look up route
   entries in a BRT based on longest prefix match.  All of the matched
   entries are composed of a candidate hops list.  Secondly, M7 look up
   negative route entries in a NRT taking the destination address of the
   forwarding packet as criteria.  This lookup is not limited to the
   longest prefix match, any entry that matches the criteria would be
   selected and composed of an avoiding hops list.  Thirdly, the
   candidate hops minus avoiding hops are composed of an applicable hops
   list.  At last, M7 sends the forwarding packet to any one of the
   applicable hops.  If the applicable list is empty, the forwarding
   packet will be dropped.

             Figure 7: The Finite State Machine of FAR Router

   1)When a router starts up, it starts a Hello thread and then starts
   ND (neighbor detection) timer (3 seconds).  Next the router goes into
   ND (neighbor detection) state.
   2)In the ND state, if a router received a Hello message, then it
   performs a Hello-message processing and goes back to the ND state.
   3)When the ND timer is over, a router goes into ND-FIN (neighbor
   detection finished) state.
   4)A router starts the LFD (link failure detection) thread and DFD
   (device failure detection) state, and sends DA message and DLR
   message to all of its active ports.  Then the router goes into Listen
   state.
   5) If a router receives a Hello message, then goes into HELLO-RECV
   state.
   6) If a router receives a DLR message, then goes into DLR-RECV state.
   7) If a router receives a DA message, then goes into DA-RECV state.
   8) If a router receives a LFA message, then goes into LFA-RECV state.
   9) A router performs the Hello-message processing.  After that, it
   goes back to Listen state.
   10) A router performs the DLR-message processing.  After that, it
   goes back to Listen state.
   11) A router performs the DA-message processing.  After that, it goes
   back to Listen state.

   12) A router performs the LFA-message processing.  After that, it
   goes back to Listen state.
   13) Hello thread produces and sends Hello messages to all its ports
   periodically.
   14) LFD thread calls link-failure-detection processing to check link
   failures in all links periodically
   15) DA thread produces and sends DA messages periodically (30
   minutes).
   16) When DFD thread starts up, it sleep a short time (30 seconds) to
   wait for a router learning all the active routers in the network.
   Then the thread calls the device-failure-detection processing to
   check device failures periodically (30 minutes).

8.  Compatible Architecture

   As a generic routing protocol, FAR can be run in various DCNs with
   regular topology.  Up to now, we have implemented the FAR protocol
   for 4 types of DCN, including Fat-tree, BCube, MatrixDCN and Diamond.

   For different network architectures, most processing of FAR is same
   besides calculation of routing tables.  BRT routing tables are
   calculated based on Hello messages and NRT routing tables are
   calculated based on LFA messages in FAR.  To extend FAR to support a
   new network architecture, only processing of Hello and LFA messages
   need providing to build BRT and NRT routing tables.

   In this protocol, FAR can support maximally 12 network architectures
   and at least support 1 built-in network architecture, such as Fat-
   tree, BCube and MatrixDCN,etc.  Each network architecture is assigned
   a unique number from 1 to 12.  For example, if the 1 built-in
   architectures are assigned 1, and other customized architectures are
   assigned 2 to 12.
   1: Fat-tree
   2: BCube
   3: MatrixDCN.
   4: xxx.
   ......
   12: xxx.

9.  Topology identification and broadcast storm suppression

   In this design, the initial topology discovery process is not a
   mandatory option for a FAR routing protocol.  The recommended
   solution here is to use a pre-configured configuration file, which
   contains topology parameters of the current system, each node device
   as long as according to these configuration parameters will be able
   to know the topology information.  In this way, we do not have to
   deal with complex topology discovery processes, nor do we need to



Bin Liu, et al.           Expires June 3, 2022                 [Page 23]

   calculate the shortest path, because the optimal path can be
   calculated from the parameters.  This protocol also allows the
   formation of configuration files to be submitted to the topology
   discovery protocol, allowing for a variety of different
   implementation options.

   Regarding the flood suppression processing of broadcast packets, it
   has been considered in the previous content.  Since the hello packets
   is only transmitted between the two nodes, it cannot be spread out.
   The link error message is only sent to the CPU, and are not forwarded
   to the nodes in layer 2 broadcasting.  Moreover, each node will
   discard the repeated error messages when the node receives them.  In
   this way, the broadcast storm can be suppressed.  If a link is
   unstable and repeatedly up or down, the system will not send new
   messages after sending notifications, and the system will not
   oscillate repeatedly.  The topology is updated only when the link is
   later detected to be stable for a long time.


10.  Application Example

   In this section, we take a Fat-tree network(Fig. 7) as an example to
   describe how to apply FAR routing.  Since M1 to M4 are very simple,
   we only introduce how the modules M5, M6, and M7 work in a Fat-tree
   network.

   A Fat-tree network is composed of 4 layers.  The top layer is core
   layer, and the other layers are aggregation layer, edge layer and
   server layer.  There are k pods, each one containing two layers of
   k/2 switches.  Each k-port switch in the edge layer is directly
   connected to k/2 hosts.  The remaining k/2 ports are connected to k/2
   of the k-port switches in the aggregation layer.  There are (k/2)2
   k-port core switches.  Each core switch has one port connected to
   each of the k pods.

   Aggregation switches are given addresses of the form 10.pod.0.switch,
   where pod denotes the pod number, and switch denotes the position of
   that switch in the upper pod (in [1, k/2]).  Edge switches are given
   addresses of the form 10.pod.switch.1, where pod denotes the pod
   number, and switch denotes the position of that switch in the lower
   pod (in [1, k/2]).  The core switches are given addresses of the form
   10.0.j.i, where j and i denote that switch's coordinates in the
   (k/2)2 core switch grid (each in[1, (k/2)], starting from top-left).
   The address of a host follows the pod switch to which it is connected
   to; hosts have addresses of the form: 10.pod.switch.ID, where ID is
   the host's position in that subnet (in [2, k/2+1], starting from left
   to the right).

10.1.  BRT Building Procedure

   By leveraging the topology's regularity, every switch clearly knows
   how it forwards a packet.  When a packet arrives at an edge switch,
   if the destination of the packet lies in the same subnet with the
   switch, then the switch directly forwards the packet to the
   destination server through layer-2 switching.  Otherwise, the switch
   forwards the packet to any of aggregation switches in the same pod.
   When a packet arrives at an aggregation switch, if the destination of
   the packet lies in the same pod, the switch forwards the packet to
   the corresponding edge switch.  Otherwise, the switch forwards the
   packet to any of core switches that it is connected to.  If a core
   switch receives a packet, it forwards the packet to the corresponding
   aggregation switch that lies in the destination pod.

   The forwarding policy discussed above is easily expressed through a
   BRT.  The BRT of an edge switch, such as 10.1.1.1, is composed of the
   following entries:


   Destination/Mask       Next hop
   10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0     10.1.0.1
   10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0     10.1.0.2

   The BRT of an aggregation switch, such as 10.1.0.1, is composed of
   the following entries:


   Destination/Mask            Next hop
   10.1.1.0/255 255.255.0      10.1.1.1
   10.1.2.0/255.255.255.0      10.1.2.1
   10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0          10.0.1.1
   10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0          10.0.1.2

   The BRT of a core switch, such as 10.0.1.1, is composed of the
   following entries:


   Destination/Mask            Next hop
   10.1.0.0/255 255.0.0        10.1.0.1
   10.2.0.0/255.255.0.0        10.2.0.1

10.2.  NRT Building Procedure

   The route entries in an NRT are related with link and node failures.
   We summarize all types of cases into three (3) catalogs.

10.2.1.  Single Link Failure

   In Fat-tree, Links can be classified as 3 types by their locations:
   1) servers to edge switches; 2) edge to aggregation switches; 3)
   aggregation to core switches.  Link failures between servers to edge
   switches only affect the communication of the corresponding servers
   and don't affect the routing tables of any switch, so we only discuss
   the second and third type of links failures.

   Edge to Aggregation Switches

   Suppose that the link between an edge switch, such as 10.1.2.1 (A),
   and an aggregation switch, such as 10.1.0.1(B),fails.  This link
   failure may affect 3 types of communications.

   o Sources lie in the same subnet with A, and destinations do not.  In
   this case, the link failure will only affect the routing tables of A.
   As this link is attached to A directly, A only needs to delete the
   route entries whose next hop is B in its BRT and add no entries to
   its NRT when A's M6 module detect the link failure.

   o Destinations lie in the same subnet with A, and sources lie in
   another subnet of the same pod.  In this case, the link failure will
   affect the routing tables of all the edge switches in the same pod
   except for A.  When an edge switch, such as 10.1.1.1, learns the link
   failure, it will add a route entry to its NRT:


   Destination/Mask            Next hop
   10.1.2.0/255.255.255.0      10.1.0.1

   o Destinations lie in the same subnet with A, sources lie in another
   pod.  In this case, the link failure will affect the routing tables
   of all the edge switches in the other pods.  When an edge switch in
   one other pod, such as 10.3.1.1, learns the link failure, because all
   the routings that pass through 10.3.0.1 to A will certainly pass
   through the link between A and B, 10.3.1.1 need add a route entry to
   its NRT:


   Destination/Mask            Next hop
   10.1.2.0/255.255.255.0      10.3.0.1

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


   Aggregation to Core Switches

   Suppose that the link between an aggregation switch, such as 10.1.0.1
   (A), and a core switch, such as 10.0.1.2(B), fails.  This link
   failure may affect 2 types of communications.

   o Sources lie in the same pod (pod 1) with A, and destinations lie in
   the other pods.  In this case, the link failure will only affect the
   routing tables of A.  As this link is attached to A directly, A only
   need to delete the route entries whose next hop is B in its BRT and
   add no entries to its NRT when A's M6 module detect the link failure.

   o Destinations lie in the same pod (pod 1) with A, and sources lie in
   another pod.  In this case, the link failure will affect the routing
   tables of all the aggregation switches in other pods except for pod
   1.  When an aggregation switch in one other pod, such as 10.3.0.1,
   learns the link failure, because all the routings that pass through
   10.0.1.2 to the pod 1 where A lies will certainly pass through the
   link between A and B, 10.3.0.1 need add a route entry to its NRT:


   Destination/Mask            Next hop
   10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0        10.0.1.2

10.2.2.  A Group of Link Failures

   If all the uplinks of an aggregation switch fail, then this switch
   cannot forward packets, which will affect the routing of every edge
   switches.  Suppose that all the uplinks of the node A (10.1.0.1)
   fail, it will affect two types of communications.

   o Sources lie in the same pod (pod 1) with A, and destinations lie in
   the other pods.  In this case, the link failures will affect the
   routing of the edge switches in the Pod of A.  To avoid the node A,
   each edge switch should remove the route entry "10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0
   10.1.0.1" in which the next hop is the node A.

   o Destinations lie in the same pod (pod 1) with A, and sources lie in
   other pods.  In this case, the link failures will affect the routing
   of edge switches in other pods.  For example, if the edge switch
   10.3.1.1 communicates with some node in the pod of A, it should avoid
   the node 10.3.0.1, because any communication through 10.3.0.1 to the
   pod of A will pass through the node A.  So a route entry should be
   added to 10.3.1.1:


   Destination/Mask            Next hop
   10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0        10.3.0.1

10.2.3.  Node Failures

   At last, we discuss the effect of node failures to a NRT.  There are
   3 types of node failures: the failure of edge, aggregation and core
   switches.

   o An edge switch fails.  The failure doesn't affect the routing table
   of any switch.

   o A core switch fails.  Only when all the core switches connected to
   the same aggregation switch fail, they will affect the routing of
   other switches.  This case is equal to the case that all the uplinks
   of an aggregation switch fail, so the process of link failures can
   cover it.

   o An aggregation switch fails.  This case is similar to the case that
   all the uplinks of an aggregation switch fail.  It affects the
   routing of edge switches in other pods, but doesn't affect the
   routing of edge switches in pod of the failed switch.  The process of
   this failure is same to the second case in section 6.2.2.

10.3.  Routing Procedure

   FAR decides a routing by looking up its BRT and NRT.  We illuminate
   the routing procedure by an example.  In this example, we suppose
   that the link between 10.3.1.1 and 10.3.0.2 and the link between
   10.1.2.1 and 10.1.0.2 have failed.  Then we look into the routing
   procedure of a communication from 10.3.1.3 (source) to 10.1.2.2
   (destination).

   Step 1: The source 10.3.1.3 sends packets to its default router
   10.3.1.1

   Step 2: The routing of 10.3.1.1.

   1) Calculate candidate hops

   10.3.1.1 looks up its BRT and gets the following matched entries:


   Destination/Mask            Next hop
   10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0          10.3.0.1

   So the candidate hops = {10.3.0.1}

   2) Calculate avoiding hops

   Its NRT is empty, so the set of avoiding hop is empty too.

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


   3) Calculate applicable hops

   The applicable hops are candidate hops minus avoiding hops, so:

   The applicable hops = {10.3.0.1}

   4) Forward packets to 10.3.0.1

   Step 3: The routing of 10.3.0.1

   1) Calculate candidate hops.

   10.3. 0.1 looks up its BRT and gets the following matched entries:


   Destination/Mask           Next hop
   10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0       10.0.1.1
   10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0       10.0.1.2


   So the candidate hops = {10.0.1.1, 10.0.1.2}

   2) Calculate avoiding hops


   Destination/Mask           Next hop
   10.1.0.0/255.255.0.0       10.0.1.2


   So the avoiding hops = {10.0.1.2}

   3) Calculate applicable hops

   The applicable hops are candidate hops minus avoiding hops, so:

   The applicable hops = {10.0.1.1}

   4) Forward packets to 10.0.1.1

   Step 4: 10.0.1.1 forwards packets to 10.1.0.1 by looking up its
   routing tables.

   Step 5: 10.1.0.1 forwards packets to 10.1.2.1 by looking up its
   routing tables.

   Step 6:10.1.2.1 forwards packets to the destination 10.1.2.2 by
   layer-2 switching.

10.4.  FAR's Performance in Large-scale Networks

   FAR has good performance to support large-scale networks.  In this
   section, we take a Fat-tree network composed of 2,880 48-port
   switches and 27,648 servers as an example to show FAR's performance.

10.4.1.  The number of control messages required by FAR

   FAR exchanges a few messages between routers and only consumes a
   little network bandwidth.  Tab. 1 shows the required messages in the
   example Fat-tree network.
   Table 1:Required messages in a Fat-tree network.
   _____________________________________________________________________
   Message Type| Scope | size(bytes) | Rate | Bandwidth
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hello |adjacent switches|less than 48|10 messages/sec|less than 4
   kbps
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   DLR |adjacent switches| less than 48 | (1) |48bytes
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   DA |entire network| less than 48 | (2) |1.106M
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   LFA |entire network| less than 48 | (3) |48 bytes
   _____________________________________________________________________
   (1)Produce one when a router starts
   (2)The number of switches(2,880) in a period
   (3)Produce one when a link fails or recovers

10.4.2.  The Calculating Time of Routing Tables

   A BRT is calculated according to the states of its neighbor routers
   and attached links.  An NRT is calculated according to device and
   link failures in the entire network.  So FAR does not calculate
   network topology and has no problem of network convergence, which
   greatly reduces the calculating time of routing tables.  The
   detection and spread time of link failures is very short in FAR.
   Detection time is up to the interval of sending Hello message.  In
   FAR, the interval is set to 100ms, and a link failure will be
   detected in 200ms.  The spread time between any pair of routers is
   less than 200ms.If a link fails in a data center network, FAR can
   detect it, spread it to all the routers, and calculate routing tables
   in no more than 500ms.

10.4.3.  The Size of Routing Tables

   For the test Fat-tree network, the sizes of BRTs and NRTs are shown
   in Tab. 2.

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


   Table 2: The size of routing tables in FAR
   _____________________________________________________________________
   Routing Table| Core Switch | Aggregation Switch | Edge Switch |
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   BRT | 48 | 48 | 24
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   NRT | 0 | 14 | 333
   _____________________________________________________________________

   The BRT's size at a switch is determined by the number of its
   neighbor switches.  In the example network, a core switch has 48
   neighbor switches (aggregation switch), so it has 48 entries in its
   BRT.Only aggregation and edge switches have NRTs.  The NRT size at a
   switch is related to the number of link failures in the network.
   Suppose that there are 1000 link failures in the example network, the
   number of failed links is 1.2% of total links, which is a very high
   failure ratio.  We suppose that link failures are uniformly
   distributed in the entire network.  The NRT size at an edge switch is
   about 333 and the NRT size of an aggregation switch is about 14in
   average.

11.  Implementations Examples

   In the FAR draft scenario, Fat-Tree topology has only three layers of
   routers.  To expand the network scale is achieved through horizontal
   expansion: increase the number of core switches, and increase the
   number of aggregation switches and edge switches in pod.

   For example, the following two scenarios.

Internet-Draft                 FAR for DCN                      Nov 2021


13.  Conclusions

   This draft introduces FAR protocol, a generic routing method and
   protocol, for data centers that have a regular topology.  It uses two
   routing tables, a BRT and an NRT, to store the normal routing paths
   and the forbidden (to-be-avoided) routing paths, respectively.  This
   makes the FAR protocol very simple and efficient.  The sizes of these
   two tables are very small.  Usually, a BRT has only several tens of
   entries and an NRT has only several or about a dozen entries.

16.  Appendix

16.1.  Application Area of the Solution

   According to the horizontal expansion mode of the above scenarios,
   the whole Fat-Tree network does not need to be expanded to 4 layers
   (4 order Fat-Tree) even if it is expanded.  Using a standard three-
   tier Fat-tree network, we can scale the network to meet all the
   problems of commercial network applications.  This scheme is suitable
   for non-SDN distributed Fat-Tree network architecture.

16.2.  Technical evolution roadmap

   In this draft, we should design different rules for FAR switches in
   different regular networks to calculate routing tables, which limits
   FAR's extensibility.  Fortunately, the latest SDN technology make it
   is easy to update the control plane of switches, since all the
   function of control plane are centralized to a controller in SDN.  We
   are designing the next generation routing scheme for regular networks
   based on SDN.  In the new scheme, we design a regular ToPology
   Description Language (TPDL) to descript a regular network.  In TPDL,
   the distance between different type of node groups is defined by a
   group of distance formulas and the number of formulas is finite and
   fixed without increasing by the scale of a network.  And then,
   switches learn the topology of a network by taking advantage of TPDL
   and generate flow table entries to forward packets without help of
   the SDN controller.  If no entry is found for a forwarding packet,
   switches transport the packet to the SDN controller, and the
   controller recalculates a new routing path using A* algorithm by
   taking TPDL's distance formulas as a heuristic function and dispatch
   flow table entries down to related switches on the path.

16.3.  Updating roadmap

   In the next version, we will continue to advance the remaining issues
   such as protocol fields, section 3.2 simplification, etc.
