1.  Introduction

   Some DNS operators generate, or wish to generate, customized DNS
   responses based on the originator of a DNS query.  For example,
   [RFC7871], "Client Subnet in DNS Queries", defines a method to convey
   partial IP network address information about the device that
   originated a DNS request, so that a response could be targeted to be
   topographically near the source.

   Some specialized services, however, need more precise client identity
   information to function adequately.  For example, a parental control
   service that restricts access to particular domains from particular
   devices needs to have a device-specific identifier.

   This document defines an EDNS [RFC6891] option to convey client
   identification information that is relevant to the DNS query.  It is
   added by software on the client's local area network, for
   transmission to the upstream DNS provider.

Internet-Draft     Client ID in Forwarded DNS Queries         March 2017


   A similar EDNS option is already being used on the public Internet in
   two different implementations.  One is between the [dnsmasq] resolver
   on the client side and Nominum's [Vantio_CacheServe] upstream.  It
   uses EDNS option code 65073 from the "Reserved for Local/Experimental
   Use" range to pass the client's Media Access Control (MAC) address.
   The other implementation is for Cisco's [Umbrella], aka OpenDNS,
   which encodes the client's MAC address and complete IP address.  It
   uses option codes 26946 and 20292, respectively, from the middle of
   the "Unassigned" range.

   This document codifies a more flexible format that can accommodate
   the needs of both implementations, as well as other more opaque
   identifiers.  It is intended to supersede those non-standard options.

   This option is intended only for constrained environments where its
   use can be carefully controlled.  It is completely optional and
   should be ignored by most DNS software.

2.  Privacy Considerations

   The IETF is actively working on enhancing DNS privacy
   [DPRIVE_Working_Group], and the re-injection of personally
   identifiable information has been identified as a problematic design
   pattern [I-D.hardie-privsec-metadata-insertion].

   Because this option transmits information that is meant to identify
   specific clients, to be considered compliant with this draft
   implementations MUST NOT add the option without explicit opt-in by an
   administrator on the local area network.  For example, agreeing to
   the terms of service for a device-specific DNS filtering product
   would allow the option to be enabled, and only for communication to
   the product's DNS server(s).

   Implementers need to be aware of the various laws and regulations
   governing handling personal data, but they are out of scope of this
   document.

   No explicit provision is made in the protocol to opt-out.  For more
   discussion on this, see Section 9, "Security Considerations".

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119]

   For a comprehensive treatment of DNS terms, please see [RFC7719].
   This document uses the following additional terms:

Internet-Draft     Client ID in Forwarded DNS Queries         March 2017


   ECID  EDNS Client Identification.

   Client  The user or device that originates a DNS lookup.

   Nameserver  A DNS server capable of resolving a DNS query and
      formulating a response.

   Forwarding Resolver  A nameserver that does not do iterative
      resolution itself, but instead passes that responsibility to
      another resolver, called a "Forwarder" in [RFC2308] section 1.

   Tailored Response  A response from a nameserver that is customized
      based on a policy defined for the client requesting the query.

4.  Option Format

   This protocol uses an EDNS [RFC6891] option to include client
   identification information in DNS messages.  The option is structured
   as follows:

                 +0 (MSB)                        +1 (LSB)
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   0: |                         OPTION-CODE                       |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   2: |                        OPTION-LENGTH                      |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   4: |                       IDENTIFIER-TYPE                     |
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
   6: |                                                           /
      /                      CLIENT-IDENTIFIER                    /
      /                                                           /
      +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

   OPTION-CODE:  2 octets per [RFC6891].  For ECID the code is TBD by
      IANA.

   OPTION-LENGTH:  2 octets per [RFC6891].  Contains the length of the
      payload following OPTION-LENGTH, in octets.

   IDENTIFIER-TYPE:  2 octets per [Address_Family_Numbers], describing
      the format of CLIENT-IDENTIFIER as elaborated below. [ Is it
      better to call this ADDRESS-FAMILY? ]

   CLIENT-IDENTIFIER:  A variable number of octets, depending on
      IDENTIFIER-TYPE.

   All fields are in network byte order ("big-endian", per [RFC1700],
   Data Notation).

Internet-Draft     Client ID in Forwarded DNS Queries         March 2017


   This draft only specifies behaviour for the following IDENTIFIER-TYPE
   values and the corresponding CLIENT-IDENTIFIER lengths:

   o  16389 (0x4005, 48-bit MAC): 6 octets, fixed.

   o  1 (0x0001, IP version 4): 4 octets, fixed.

   o  2 (0x0002, IP version 6): 16 octets, fixed.

   o  16 (0x0010, Domain Name System): Variable-length domain name in
      uncompressed wire format followed by a variable-length custom
      token.

   For DNS servers that implement ECID, it is RECOMMENDED that they
   recognize at least the 48-bit MAC CLIENT-IDENTIFIER.

   The use of Domain Name System as an address family is to facilitate
   custom tokens that are not well-conceptualized as addresses, as
   described in Section 6.

   Other types of identifying addresses, such as a 64-bit MAC [RFC7042]
   or a DHCP Unique Identifier [RFC3315] and [RFC6355] could be
   accommodated as devices and needs change, without needing to define
   new EDNS option codes to cover them. [ Why not just bless those
   obvious candidates now? ]

   Multiple ECID options MAY appear in the OPT record.  However, the
   same IDENTIFIER-TYPE SHOULD not appear more than once, and each ECID
   option MUST only carry one IDENTIFIER-TYPE and CLIENT-IDENTIFIER
   pair.

5.  Protocol Description

5.1.  DNS Query

   Any client that originates a DNS query message MAY include the ECID
   option in the DNS Query message.  It is normally expected that the
   client itself would not do this, but rather that it will be added by
   the local forwarding resolver.

   When a DNS forwarding resolver, provided as part of a router for
   example, receives a DNS query message from the originating client it
   adds any IDENTIFIER-TYPE / CLIENT-IDENTIFIER pairs that it supports
   but which are not present in the existing client request.  It then
   sends the request to the upstream full-service resolver.

   Because the option contains personally identifiable information, it
   should be protected by either only being used within Autonomous

Internet-Draft     Client ID in Forwarded DNS Queries         March 2017


   Systems [RFC1930] controlled by the same provider, by going over an
   opaque channel such as DNS over TLS [RFC7858], or by being securely
   encoded and varying per request.  It MUST NOT be sent in clear-text
   across the Internet.

5.2.  DNS Response

   The logic used by a full-service resolver to customize a response
   based on ECID is out of scope for this document.  The resolver MUST
   NOT include the ECID option in any queries that it makes to external
   authoritative DNS servers.

   For possible caching purposes, the forwarding resolver needs to know
   whether filtering affected the response.  If the name resolution
   involved any names for which customization was possible, even if such
   filtering resulted in delivering the original data, the response
   SHOULD include an ECID option which contains the FAMILY-ADDRESS and
   CLIENT-IDENTIFIER pairs that were considered for filtering.

   For example, if a filter is set such that only names in the
   example.com domain are possibly restricted to some devices, then a
   request for foo.example.com would have the ECID in the response even
   when the request came from a device which was not restricted.
   Requests for any other names would not include ECID in the response.

   So that the caching forwarding resolver does not need to have any
   knowledge about what filters are in place, it is the full-service
   resolver's responsibility to adjust any TTLs in the response as might
   be dictated by the filter policy it has configured.  That is, if some
   name is filtered only between the hours of 09:00 and 17:00 and a
   request is received for that name at 16:59:59, the TTL on a positive
   response or the SOA ncache field on a negative response should be set
   to just one second and the ECID option included as described above.

   If the request contains a malformed ECID option, such as CLIENT-
   IDENTIFIER not correctly matching the length of described by OPTION-
   LENGTH and IDENTIFIER-TYPE, the resolver SHOULD reply with DNS rcode
   FORMERR.

   If the resolver by policy does not respond to requests that are
   lacking ECID of the appropriate IDENTIFIER-TYPE, it SHOULD reply with
   DNS rcode REFUSED.

6.  Using the DNS Address Family

   When IDENTIFIER-TYPE 16 is used, the uncompressed wire format of the
   domain name is followed by a token that is otherwise opaque to this
   specification.  The length of that token is defined by OPTION-LENGTH

Internet-Draft     Client ID in Forwarded DNS Queries         March 2017


   less the two octets used for IDENTIFIER-TYPE and the length of the
   domain name.

   The name used SHOULD be in a namespace that is controlled by the
   service provider that is using the option, but need not be resolvable
   in the DNS.  We RECOMMEND that providers use short domain names to
   minimize DNS packet length.

   The domain name provides protection against conflicts with other
   users of the option without the burden of creating yet another IANA
   Registry to manage yet another two-octet code.  Co-operating
   forwarder/resolver pairs are the only users of the data who need to
   be concerned with its format.

7.  Implementation Status

   [RFC Editor: per RFC 6982 this section should be removed prior to
   publication.]

   The protocol proposed here is not currently used anywhere exactly as
   described, though the Nominum and Umbrella implementations are
   substantially similar.

   The authors know of at least two providers who wish to have it
   properly standardized and would implement the standard in preference
   to either of the existing non-standard methods.

8.  NAT Considerations

   Devices that perform Network Address Translation (NAT) SHOULD NOT
   give special consideration for ECID.  NAT translates between a layer
   3 private IP address assigned to a client device on the Local Area
   Network and a layer 3 public IP address for use within the Wide Area
   Network.  If ECID is being used to pass an IPv4 or IPv6 address, it
   SHOULD use the internal address without NAT translation, because
   transforming it to the public address of the NAT device would
   coalesce all internal devices to just one address.

   Other ECID options identify a client device by a different means,
   e.g. its layer 2 address.  This sort of device's identifier is not
   impacted by NAT.  Therefore, DNS queries may be passed without
   modification of any ECID information.

9.  Security Considerations

   The identifier of the client that initiated the request will be
   visible to all servers that are passed the ECID option, and the

   various devices on the path between the local network and the full-
   service resolver being used by the forwarding resolver.

   DNS filtering products are easy circumvented and should not be
   considered real security measures.  With commonly available tools it
   is trivial to discover the non-filtered DNS responses and use them in
   place of the filtered responses.

   Along those lines, opting out of this specific protocol is as simple
   as using a different resolver, such as a full-service resolver on the
   device itself or one of the well-known public resolvers.  Of course,
   other devices on the local network will still be able to see
   unencrypted DNS requests from the device, and the only way to really
   protect against such monitoring is to use an opaque tunnel to a
   trusted resolver.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign a new value in the DNS EDNS Option Codes
   registry for the Device ID option.
