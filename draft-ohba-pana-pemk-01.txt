Abstract

   This document defines PaC-EP Master Key (PEMK), a master key used
   between a PANA client and an enforcement point, for bootstrapping
   lower-layer ciphering.  A PEMK is derived from EAP Master Session Key
   as a result of successful PANA authentication.  The PEMK is defined
   to guarantee cryptographic independence among enforcement points
   across different types of lower-layers.

Internet-Draft              PaC-EP Master Key              November 2007


1.  Introduction

   PANA (Protocol for carrying Authentication for Network Access)
   [I-D.ietf-pana-pana] is designed to facilitate network access
   authentication and authorization of clients in access networks.  It
   carries EAP [RFC3748] between a PaC (PANA Client) and a PAA (PANA
   Authentication Agent) where the PAA functions as an authentication
   gateway to the Authentication Server (AS).  The PANA framework
   [I-D.ietf-pana-framework] defines an another entity referred to as an
   EP (Enforcement Point) which resides in the access network and allows
   access (data traffic) of authorized PaCs while preventing access by
   others depending on the PANA authentication and authorization result.
   The EP and PAA may be implemented on the same device or separate
   devices.

   The EP uses non-cryptographic or cryptographic filters to selectively
   allow and discard data packets.  These filters may be applied at the
   link-layer or the IP-layer [I-D.ietf-pana-ipsec].  When cryptographic
   access control is used, a secure association protocol [RFC3748] needs
   to run between the PaC and EP.  After completion of the secure
   association protocol, link or network layer per-packet security (for
   example TKIP, IPsec ESP) is enabled for integrity protection, data
   origin authentication, replay protection and optionally
   confidentiality protection.

   This document defines PaC-EP Master Key (PEMK) that is used by a
   secure association protocol as the pre-shared secret between the PaC
   and EP to enable cryptographic filters in the access network.  The
   PEMK is defined to guarantee cryptographic independence among EPs
   across different lower-layer types.  This document also describes
   guideline for distributing PEMKs from the PAA to EP.

   This document does not specify a mechanism for a PaC to know whether
   the lower-layer requires a secure association protocol or the pre-
   shared secret for the secure association protocol needs to be
   bootstrapped from PANA authentication.  Such a mechanism may be
   defined by each lower-layer protocol.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   In this document, several words are used to signify the requirements
   of the specification.  These words are often capitalized.  The key
   words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document
   are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.  PaC-EP Master Key

   A PEMK (PaC-EP Master Key) is derived from the available MSK.  The
   PEMK is 64 octets in length and it is calculated as follows:

   PEMK = prf+(MSK, "PaC-EP master key" | SID | KID | EPDID)

   o  The prf+ function is defined in IKEv2 [RFC4306].  The pseudo-
      random function used for the prf+ function is specified in the
      PRF-Algorithm AVP carried in a PANA-Auth-Request message with 'S'
      (Start) bit set.

   o  MSK is a Master Session Key generated by EAP and exported to PANA.

   o  SID is a four-octet PANA session identifier [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].

   o  KID is the content of the PANA Key-ID AVP associated with the MSK
      [I-D.ietf-pana-pana].

   o  EP-Device-ID is the identifier of the EP.  The first two octets of
      EP-Device-ID represents the AddressType, which contains an Address
      Family defined in [IANAADFAM].  The AddressType is used to
      discriminate the content and format of the remaining octets for
      the address value.  The use of address family and address value
      guarantees the cryptographic independence of PEMKs among multiple
      EPs across multiple lower-layer protocols.  How a PaC configures
      the identifier of the EP is out of the scope of this document.

2.1.  Key Name of PEMK

   The key name of the PEMK is defined as follows.

   TBD.

2.2.  Scope of PEMK

   A PEMK is used between a PaC and an EP.  A PEMK MUST NOT be shared
   among multiple PaCs or EPs.

2.3.  Context of PEMK

   A PEMK is used as the pre-shared key of the secure association
   protocol in the scope of the PEMK.  A PEMK MUST NOT be used for any
   other usage.

2.4.  Lifetime of PEMK

   The lifetime of a PEMK MUST be no greater than the lifetime of the
   MSK.


3.  Security Considerations

   The following considerations are specifically made to follow the AAA
   key management guidance [RFC4962].  Other AAA key management
   requirements such as key lifetime, key scope, key context and key
   name are described under Section 2.

3.1.  Channel Binding

   Since the device identifier of the EP is involved in the key
   derivation function, Channel Binding on a PEMK is made between the
   PaC and PAA at the time when the PEMK is generated.  If a malicious
   EP advertises a different device identifier than that is registered
   with the PAA, the malicious attempt will not succeed since the secure
   association protocol will fail due to the difference between the PEMK
   calculated by the PaC and the PEMK calculated by the PAA and
   distributed to the EP.

3.2.  Guideline for distributing PEMK from PAA to EP

   When an EP is implemented on the same device as the PAA, no protocol
   needs to be used for distributing a PEMK from the PAA to the EP.  It
   is assumed that an EP is implemented on the same device as the PAA
   when the device identifier of the EP is equals to a link-layer
   address or an IP address of the PAA.  Otherwise, it is assumed that
   the EP is implemented on a separate device from the PAA.

   In the case where the EP is implemented on a separate device from the
   PAA, a protocol is needed to distribute a PEMK from the PAA to the
   EP.  Such a key distribution protocol may depend on the lower-layer
   protocol over which PANA operates.  A key distribution protocol for a
   PEMK MUST ensure that the PEMK is encrypted as well as integrity and
   replay protected, with a security association between the PAA and EP,
   where the security association MUST be cryptographically bound to the
   identities of the PAA and EP known to the PaC.  The HOKEY (Handover
   Keying) key distribution protocol [I-D.ietf-hokey-key-mgm] is such a
   key distribution protocol.


4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
