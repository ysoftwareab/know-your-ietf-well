1.  Requirements notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Introduction

   The document lists requirements for optimizations of the SIP/SIMPLE
   protocol.  See [I-D.ietf-simple-simple] for the list of RFCs and
   drafts that are considered as part of the SIP/SIMPLE protocol.  These
   optimizations should reduce the load on the network and the presence
   servers in interdomain presence subscriptions.  The need for the
   requirements is based on a separate scaling analysis document
   [I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis].

   The scaling analysis document have shown that there is much room for
   optimizations in the SIP/SIMPLE protocol.  The need for optimizations
   is in the number of bytes that are sent between two federating
   domains, the number of messages that need to be processed and the
   amount of state that needs to be managed by the presence servers.

   For example, for two peering networks that have total of 20 million
   users, we got around 19 billion messages per 8 hours work day that
   needs to be exchanged between the networks only for supporting the
   presence service.

   For very large session peering (150 million subscriptions) we got a
   state close to a tera byte that needs to be managed by the server in
   order to manage presence.

   It may be that when deploying a very large systems big resources need
   to be allocated but we should take into the considration the
   following:

   o  The assumptions that have been used in the scaling analysis
      document are very moderate from the aspect of number of presence
      status changes per hour and the the size of the presence document
      that was assumed.

   o  Even when applying all current drafted and/or RFCd optimizations
      for presence we still got around 10 billion messages per 8 hours
      work day for a total of 20 million fedearting users.  This is good
      but not enough given the moderate assumptions that we have used
      and given that when presence will be deployed to a mass market the
      number of federating users will be much more then 20 million
      federating users.

3.  Requirements

   This section lists requirements for a solution that will optimize the
   interdomain presence loads.  The requirements are based on the
   presence scaling draft
   [I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis].

3.1.  Backward Compatibility Requirements

   o  REQ-001: The solution SHOULD NOT deprecate existing protocol
      mechanisms defined in SIP/SIMPLE.

   o  REQ-002: Existing SIP/SIMPLE clients SHOULD be able to communicate
      with clients and servers that implement new presence scaling
      features.

   o  REQ-003: The solution SHOULD NOT constrain any existing RFC
      functional requirements for presence.

   o  REQ-004: The solution MUST NOT constrain any existing RFC security
      requirements for presence.

   o  REQ-005: Systems that are not using the new additions to the
      protocol SHOULD operate at the same level as they do today.


3.2.  Policy, Privacy, Permissions Requirements

   o  REQ-006: The solution SHOULD NOT limit the ability for
      presentities to present different views of presence to different
      watchers.

   o  REQ-007: The solution SHOULD NOT restrict the ability of a
      presentity to obtain its list of watchers.

   o  REQ-008: The solution MUST NOT create any new or make worse any
      existing privacy holes.


3.3.  Scalability Requirements

   o  REQ-009: Presence systems (intra or inter-domain) SHOULD scale in
      linear proportion to the number of watchers and presentities in
      the system.

   o  REQ-010: The solution SHOULD NOT require a significant increase in
      the size of state to maintain, compared to the current state size
      required by SIP/SIMPLE.

Internet-Draft      Scaling Requirements for Presence       January 2009


   o  REQ-011: The solution MUST allow presence systems to scale.  Note:
      we view scalability on the order of tens of millions of users in
      each peer domain.

   o  REQ-012: There may be various usage patterns when users of one
      domain subscribe to users from another domain.  It may be that
      only small percentage of users from each domain will subscribe to
      users from the other domain, it may be that most watchers will be
      from the other domain while there will be few watchers from the
      same domain.  The solution MUST support high percentage of
      watcher/presentity intersections between the domains and it MUST
      support various intersection models.

   o  REQ-013: Protocol changes MUST NOT prohibit optimizations in
      deployment models where there is a high level of cross
      subscriptions between the domains.

   o  REQ-014: New functionalities and extensions to the presence
      protocol SHOULD take into account scalability with respect to the
      number of messages, state size and management and processing load.


3.4.  Topology Requirements

   o  REQ-015: The solution SHOULD allow for arbitrary federation
      topologies including direct and indirect peering.



4.  Considerations for Possible Optimizations

   The document provides an initial list of requirements for a solution
   of scalability of interdomain presence systems using the SIP/SIMPLE
   protocol.  The issue of scalability was shown in a separate document
   [I-D.ietf-simple-interdomain-scaling-analysis].

   The following is a discussion of the various possible paths for
   optimizations.  One of the most important considerations is whether
   there is a need to adapt SIP that was designed more as an end to end
   protocol to be much more optimized when presence server interacts
   directly with another presence server.

   It is very possible that the issues that are described in this
   document are inherent to presence systems in general and not specific
   to the SIP/SIMPLE protocol.  Organizations need to be prepared to
   invest substantial resources in the form of networks and hardware in
   order to create sizable systems.  However, it is apparent that
   additional protocol optimizations are possible and further work is

   needed in the IETF in order to provide better scalability of large
   presence systems.

   We should remember that SIP was originally designed for end to end
   session creation and number and size of messages are of secondary
   importance for an end to end session negotiation protocol.  For large
   scale and especially for very large scale presence the number of
   messages that are needed and the size of each message are of extreme
   importance.  Adequate care must be taken in addressing scalability as
   part of the initial protocol design phase; Trying to to shoehorn
   scalability at a later phase will be doomed to failure.

   We should also consider whether using the same protocol between
   clients and servers and between servers is a good choice.  It may be
   that in interdomain or even between servers in the same domain (as
   between RLSs [RFC4662], and presence servers) there is a need to have
   a different protocol that will be very optimized for the load and can
   assume some assumptions about the network (for example do not use
   unreliable protocol as UDP but only TCP, see the section that
   calculates the number of bytes and messages for imaginary very
   optimized SIP).

   When a presence server connects to another server using the current
   SIP/SIMPLE protocol, there will be an extreme number of redundant
   messages due to the overhead in the SIP protocol of supporting both
   TCP and UDP and due to the need to send multiple presence documents
   for the same watched user because of privacy issues.  A server to
   server protocol will have to address these issues.  Some initial work
   to address these issues can be found in:
   [I-D.ietf-simple-view-sharing] and
   [I-D.ietf-simple-intradomain-federation] and in other (still
   individual) drafts.

   Another issue that is more related to protocol design is whether
   NOTIFY messages should not be considered as media just like audio,
   video and even text messaging.  The SUBSCRIBE method may be extended
   to negotiate the route and other parameters of the NOTIFY messages,
   in a similar way that the INVITE method negotiates media parameters.
   This way the load can be offloaded to a specialized NOTIFY "relays"
   thus not loading the control path of SIP.  One of the possible ideas
   (Marc Willekens) is to use the SIP protocol for client/server NOTIFY
   but make use of a more optimized and controllable protocol for the
   server-to-server interface.  Another possibility is to use the MSRP
   [RFC4975], [RFC4976] protocol for the notifications.

5.  Security Considerations

   This document discusses scalability requirements for the existing
   SIP/SIMPLE protocol and model.  Many of the changes to the protocol
   will have security implications as mentioned in some of the
   requirements above.

   One example of possible protocol changes that may have security
   implications is sending a presence document only once between domains
   in order to optimize the number of messages and network load.  This
   possible optimization will delegate privacy protection from one
   domain to another domain and should be addressed when designing
   protocol optimizations

   Important part of work on the requirements and optimizations will be
   to make sure that all the security aspects are covered.
