Editor's note: 
This version (04) contains the following updates w.r.t. version 03.
(1)
Change the names of the PM Object Groups (near the end of the MIB, 
before the compliance specification) to avoid confusion between Pre-OTN 
and OTN performance monitoring. That is, change optIfOTSnPMGroup, 
optIfOMSnPMGroup, and optIfOChPMGroup to optIfOTSnPreOtnPMGroup, 
optIfOMSnPreOtnPMGroup, and optIfOChPreOtnPMGroup respectively. 
In addition, an optIfPreOtnPMCompl Compliance Module was defined for 
these three Pre-OTN PM Object Groups.
(2)
Change the subsection numbers of Section 4 (Structure of the MIB) to 
better align with the list of groups (near the end of the MIB, before 
the compliance specification).
(3)
Editorial change to comply with RFC 2418 and RFC2223 for format.

1.  Abstract

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with SNMP in TCP/IP-based internets.  In particular, it 
   defines objects for managing Optical Interfaces associated with 
   WavelengthDivision Multiplexing systems or characterized by the 
   Optical Transport Network (OTN) in accordance with [ITU G.872].

   Textual Conventions used in this MIB are defined in RFC 2579 [6]
   and RFC 2493 [19].

2.  The SNMP Network Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

   0    An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [1].

   0    Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [2], STD 16, RFC 1212 [3] and RFC
        1215 [4].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [5], STD 58, RFC 2579 [6] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [7].

   0    Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [9] and RFC 1906 [10].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [10], RFC 2572 [11] and RFC 2574 [12].

   0    Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [8].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [13].

   o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [14] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [15].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [16].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (e.g., use of Counter64).  Some machine 
   readable information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual 
   descriptions in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, 
   this loss of machine readable information is not considered to 
   change the semantics of the MIB.

3.  Overview

   In this document, the term OTN (Optical Transport Network) system
   is used to describe devices that are compliant with the requirements 
   specified in the ITU-T Recommendations G.872 [22], G.709 [20], 
   G.798 [21], G.874 [23] and G.874.1 [24], available as of the date 
   this document. As some of the ITU-T Recommendations may have not yet 
   been approved, implementers of DWDM systems are advised to refer to 
   most recent versions of these ITU-T Recommendations.
   
   The optical objects will be managed using the MIB II ifTable and
   ifStackTable.  Additional tables will also be supported to monitor
   layer specific status and provide performance monitoring data.
   In the tables, some entries are required for OTN systems only.
   A Configuration (Config) table, Current Performance Monitoring (PM) 
   table, and Interval PM table will be maintained for the OTSn, OMSn, 
   and OCh layers on a source and sink trail termination basis.  
   These tables will be linked to the ifTable by using the ifIndex 
   that is associated with that layer.
 
   These objects are used when the particular media being used to
   realize an interface is an Optical Transport interface.  At present,
   this applies to these values of the ifType variable in the 
   Internet-standard MIB:

   opticalChannel (195), opticalTransport (196) 

   The definitions contained herein are based on the OTN
   specifications in ITU-T G.872[22], G.709 [20], G.798[21], G.874[23], 
   and G.874.1 [24].

3.1.  Use of the ifTable

   This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in
   RFC 2863 [18], is used for optical interfaces.  Only the 
   ifGeneralInformationGroup will be supported for the ifTable and the
   ifStackTable to maintain the relationship between the various layers.
   The OTN layers are managed in the ifTable using IfEntries that 
   correlate to the layers depicted in Figure 1.

   For example, a DWDM device with an Optical Network Node Interface
   (ONNI) will have an Optical Transmission Section (OTS) physical 
   layer, an Optical Multiplex Section (OMS) layer (transports multiple
   optical channels), and an Optical Channel (OCh) layer.  There is a 
   one to one relationship between the OMS and OTS layers.  The OMS 
   layer has fixed connectivity via the OTS and thus no connectivity 
   flexibility at the OMS layer is supported.

   A device with an ONNI that does not multiplex would consist of
   the OTS and OCh layers supporting a single channel.

   MIB II (RFC 1213) [17], as extended by RFC 2863 [18], accommodates 
   these cases through appropriate use of the MIB II system and 
   interfaces groups. The system group names and describes the type of 
   managed resource. The interfaces group defines which OTN layers apply
   and how these layers are configured and multiplexed.  This is 
   achieved by proper representation of OTN Layers as IfEntries as 
   defined in RFC 2863 [18], as follows:

   In the following figures, opticalChannel and opticalTransport are 
   abbreviated as och and otn respectively.

                         Figure 1: OTN Layers


   Since the OMSn and OTSn layers have a one to one relationship, only
   one otn IfEntry is required to support these two layers.  Therefore,
   each opticalChannel IfEntry may be mapped to m opticalTransport 
   IfEntries, where m is greater than or equal to 1.  Conversely, each 
   opticalTransport entry may be mapped to n opticalChannel IfEntries, 
   where n is greater than or equal to 1.

   Example 1: Management of unterminated opticalChannel (och) using 
   passive optics

   An OTN device connected with two adjacent nodes in a single
   fiber ring that supports 10 wavelengths per fiber would have
   2 opticalTransport IfEntries and 10 opticalChannel IfEntries, as 
   depicted in Figure 2. Thus, the same 10 opticalChannel IfEntries 
   are stacked above each of the opticalTransport IfEntries.

   Example 2: Management of terminated opticalChannel (och) interfaces

   An OTN device connected with two adjacent nodes in a single
   fiber ring that supports 10 wavelengths per fiber would have
   2 opticalTransport IfEntries and 20 opticalChannel IfEntries, 
   as depicted in Figure 3. Thus 10 opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked 
   above the first opticalTransport IfEntry, and the other 10 
   opticalChannel IfEntries are stacked above the second 
   opticalTransport IfEntry.

3.4.  Use of ifStackTable

   Use of the ifStackTable to associate the opticalTransport and 
   opticalChannel interface entries is best illustrated by the example 
   shown in Figure 4.  The example assumes an otn interface with ifIndex i 
   that carries two multiplexed och interfaces with ifIndex values of 
   j and k, respectively. The example shows that j and k are stacked 
   above i.e., multiplexed into) i. Furthermore, it shows that there is 
   no layer lower than i and no layer higher than j and/or k.

3.5.2   Performance Parameters

   To facilitate the location of equipment that may require
   maintenance it is necessary to monitor measurements such
   as laser temperature and optical power at each layer. The
   measurements are taken periodically, 15 minute intervals,
   and a current snapshot of the value is also made available.

   Each performance parameter is monitored in a current 15
   minute interval. The current interval will monitor the
   most current measured value, the lowest measured value,
   and the highest measured value. An upper and lower threhold
   value is also typically provided for each parameter. At the
   end of the current 15 minute interval the values are
   transferred into the appropriate 15 minute interval
   representing the period within the Performance Monitoring
   Interval Table.

   All performance parameters are accumulated (stored) in 15 minute
   intervals from 4 up to 96 intervals (24 hours worth) 
   by an agent with 32 intervals being the default.  Fewer than
   96 intervals of data will be available if the agent has been
   restarted within the last 24 hours. The NE keeps a record of
   the lowest value, highest value, and last measured value in
   each 15 minute interval.

   A Current and Previous 24 hour register will be maintained
   for each measured parameter. The current 15 minute interval
   is compared to the Current 24 Hour register and updated to
   reflect the lowest and highest values measured in the current
   24 hour period. The Current 24 Hour register is transferred
   to the Previous 24 Hour register along with the last measured
   value from the current 15 minute interval.

   There is no requirement for an agent to ensure fixed relationship
   between the start of a fifteen minute interval and any wall clock;
   however some agents may align the fifteen minute intervals with
   quarter hours.

   Performance parameters are of type Integer32, and it is used
   because it is possible for these objects to decrease, be negative.


3.6 Tandem Connection Monitoring (TCM)

   An ODUk termination can be provisioned to support (0..6) TCM levels.  
   Each TCM field contains the following subfields:
   -  Trail Trace Identifier (TTI)
   -  Bit Interleaved Parity 8 (BIP8)
   -  Backward Defect Indication (BDI)
   -  Backward Error Indication (BEI)
   -  Status bits indicating the presence of TCM overhead, Incoming 
      AlignmentError, or a maintenance signal (STAT).

   The insertion of these subfields is control by: 
   - optIfODUkTSourceMode or otnODUkTsinkMode
   
   The Detection and corresponding action of these subfields are 
   controlled by:
   - optIfODUkTTimDetMode
   - optIfODUkTTimActEnabled

   The TCM connection is used for monitoring the quality of an end to 
   end connection or any segment, as illustrated in the example:
   TCM1 used for the end-to-end connection from A1 to A2.
   TCM2 used for segment B1-B2, then used again for segment B3-B4.
   TCM3-TCM6 these bytes are not in used in this example.

   The TCM connection can be nested (B1-B2 is nested in A1-A2) or 
   cascaded (B1-B2 and B3-B4).

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB that
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments. The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.

   The managed objects in this MIB contain sensitive information since,
   collectively, they allow influencing of interfaces in OTN equipment
   or networks and provide information of their configuration.

   It is thus important to control even GET access to these objects and
   possibly to even encrypt the values of these object when sending them
   over the network via SNMP. Not all versions of SNMP provide features
   for such a secure environment.

   SNMPv1 by itself is not a secure environment. Even if the network
   itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), there is no
   control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
   GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

   It is recommended that the implementers consider the security
   features as provided by the SNMPv3 framework. Specifically, the use
   of the User-based Security Model RFC 2574 [12] and the 
   View-based Access Control Model RFC 2575 [15] is recommended.

   It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP
   entity giving access to an instance of this MIB, is properly
   configured to give access to the objects only to those principals
   (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET
   (change/create/delete) them.
