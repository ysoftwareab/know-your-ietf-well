               Home Network Prefix Renumbering in PMIPv6
                       draft-ietf-dmm-hnprenum-07

Abstract

   In the basic Proxy Mobile IPv6 (PMIPv6) specification, a Mobile Node
   (MN) is assigned with a Home Network Prefix (HNP) during its initial
   attachment and the MN configures its Home Address (HoA) with the HNP.
   During the movement of the MN, the HNP remains unchanged to keep
   ongoing communications associated with the HoA.  However, the current
   PMIPv6 specification does not specify related operations when an HNP
   renumbering has happened (e.g. due to change of service provider,
   change of site topology, etc.).  In this document, a solution to
   support the HNP renumbering is proposed, as an optional extension of
   the PMIPv6 specification.

1.  Introduction

   Network managers currently prefer Provider Independent (PI)
   addressing for IPv6 to attempt to minimize the need for future
   possible renumbering.  However, a widespread use of PI addresses will
   cause Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) scaling problems [RFC7010].  It
   is thus desirable to develop tools and practices that make IPv6
   renumbering a simpler process to reduce demand for IPv6 PI space
   [RFC6879].  In this document, we aim to solve the HNP renumbering
   problem when the HNP in PMIPv6 [RFC5213] is a PI prefix.

2.  Usage Scenarios

   There are a number of reasons why the HNP renumbering support in
   PMIPv6 is useful and some scenarios are identified below:

   o  Scenario 1: the HNP set used by a PMIPv6 service provider is
      assigned by a different Internet Service Provider (ISP), and then



Yan, et al.            Expires September 14, 2017               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft           PMIPv6 HNP Renumbering               March 2017


      the HNP renumbering MAY happen if the PMIPv6 service provider
      switches to a different ISP.

   o  Scenario 2: multiple Local Mobility Anchors (LMAs) MAY be deployed
      by the same PMIPv6 service provider, and then each LMA MAY serve
      for a specific HNP set.  In this case, the HNP of an MN MAY change
      if the current serving LMA switches to another LMA but without
      inheriting the assigned HNP set [RFC6463].

   o  Scenario 3: the PMIPv6 HNP renumbering MAY be caused by the re-
      building of the network architecture as the companies split,
      merge, grow, relocate, or reorganize.  For example, the PMIPv6
      service provider MAY reorganize its network topology.

   In the scenario 1, we assume that only the HNP is renumbered while
   the serving LMA remains unchanged and this is the basic scenario
   considered in this document.  In the scenario 2 and scenario 3, more
   complex results MAY be caused, for example, the HNP renumbering MAY
   happen due to the switchover of a serving LMA.

   In the Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) protocol, when a home network prefix
   changes, the Home Agent (HA) will actively notify the new prefix to
   its MN and then the renumbering of the Home Network Address (HoA) can
   be well supported [RFC6275].  In the basic PMIPv6, the PMIPv6 binding
   is triggered by a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG), which detects the
   attachment of the MN.  A scheme is also needed for the LMA to
   immediately initiate the PMIPv6 binding state refreshment during the
   HNP renumbering process.  Although this issue is also mentioned in
   Section 6.12 of [RFC5213], the related solution has not been
   specified.

3.  HNP Renumbering Procedure

   When the HNP renumbering happens in PMIPv6, the LMA MUST notify a new
   HNP to the MAG and then the MAG MUST announce the new HNP to the
   attached MN accordingly.  Also, the LMA and the MAG MUST update the
   routing states for the HNP and the related addresses.  To support
   this procedure, [RFC7077] can be adopted which specifies an
   asynchronous update from the LMA to the MAG about specific session
   parameters.  This document considers the following two cases:

   (1) HNP is renumbered under the same LMA

   In this case, the LMA remains unchanged as in the scenario 1 and
   scenario 3.  The operation steps are shown in Figure 1.

           Figure 1: Signaling call flow of the HNP renumbering

   o  When a PMIPv6 service provider renumbers the HNP set under the
      same LMA, the serving LMA SHOULD initiate the HNP renumbering
      operation.  The LMA allocates a new HNP for the related MN.

   o  The LMA sends the Update Notification (UPN) message to the MAG to
      update the HNP information.  If the Dynamic Host Configuration
      Protocol (DHCP) is used to allocate the address, the new HNP MUST
      be also notified to the DHCP infrastructure.

   o  Once the MAG receives this UPN message, it recognizes that the
      related MN has the new HNP.  Then the MAG MUST notify the MN about
      the new HNP with a Router Advertisement (RA) message or allocate a
      new address within the new HNP through a DHCP procedure.

   o  After the MN obtains the HNP information through the RA message,
      it deletes the old HoA and configures a new HoA with the newly
      allocated HNP.

   o  When the new HNP is announced or the new address is configured to
      the MN successfully, the MAG MUST update the related binding and
      routing states.  Then the MAG sends back the Update Notification
      Acknowledgement (UPA) message to the LMA for the notification of
      successful update of the HNP, related binding state, and routing
      state.  Then the LMA updates the routing and binding information
      corresponding to the MN to replace the old HNP with the new one.

   (2) HNP renumbering caused by the LMA switchover

   Since the HNP is assigned by the LMA, the HNP renumbering MAY be
   caused by the LMA switchover, as in the scenario 2 and scenario 3.

   The information of LMA is the basic configuration information of MAG.
   When the LMA changes, the related profile SHOULD be updated by the
   service provider.  In this way, the MAG initiates the registration to
   the new LMA as specified in [RFC5213].  When the HNP renumbering is
   caused in this case, the new HNP information is sent by the LMA
   during the new binding procedure.  Accordingly, the MAG withdraws the
   old HNP of the MN and announces the new HNP to the MN as like the
   case of the HNP is renumbered under the same LMA.

4.  Session Connectivity

   The HNP renumbering may cause the disconnection of the ongoing
   communications of the MN.  Basically, there are two modes to manage
   the session connectivity during the HNP renumbering.

   (1) Soft-mode

   The LMA will temporarily maintain the state of the old HNP during the
   HNP renumbering (after the UPA reception) in order to redirect the
   packets to the MN before the MN reconnects the ongoing session and
   notifies its new HoA to the Correspondent Node (CN).  This mode is
   aiming to reduce the packet loss during the HNP renumbering but the
   binding state corresponding to the old HNP should be marked for
   example as transient binding [RFC6058].  And the LMA MUST stop
   broadcasting the routing information about the old HNP if the old HNP
   is no longer anchored at this LMA.

   (2) Hard-mode

   If the HNP renumbering happens with the switchover of the LMA, the
   hard-mode is recommended to keep the protocol simple.  In this mode,
   the LMA deletes the binding state of the old HNP after it receives
   the UPA message from the MAG and the LMA silently discards the
   packets destined to the old HNP.

5.  Message Format

   (1) UPN message

   In the UPN message sent from the LMA to the MAG, the notification
   reason is set to 2 (UPDATE-SESSION-PARAMETERS).  Besides, the HNP
   Option [RFC5213] containing the new HNP and the Mobile Node
   Identifier Option [RFC4283] carrying identifier of MN are contained

Internet-Draft           PMIPv6 HNP Renumbering               March 2017


   as Mobility Options of UPN.  The order of HNP Option and Mobile Node
   Identifier Option in the UPN message is not mandated here.

   (2) UPA message

   The MAG sends this message in order to acknowledge that it has
   received an UPN message with the (A) flag set and to indicate the
   status after processing the message.  When the MAG did not
   successfully renumber the HNP which is required in the UPN message,
   the Status Code of 128 is set in the UPA message and the following
   operation of LMA is PMIPv6 service provider specific.

   (3) RA Message

   When the RA message is used by the MAG to advise the new HNP, two
   Prefix Information Options are contained in the RA message [RFC4861]
   [RFC4862].  In the first Prefix Information Option, the old HNP is
   carried and the related Preferred Lifetime is set to 0.  In the
   second Prefix Information Option, the new HNP is carried with the
   Valid Lifetime and Preferred Lifetime set to larger than 0.

   (4) DHCP Message

   When the DHCP is used in PMIPv6 to configure the addresses for the
   MN, new IPv6 address(es) (e.g., HoA) will be generated based on the
   new HNP and the related DHCP procedure is also triggered by the
   reception of UPN message [RFC3315].

6.  Other Issues

   In order to maintain the reachability of the MN, the Domain Name
   System (DNS) resource record corresponding to this MN may need to be
   updated when the HNP of MN changes [RFC3007].  However, this is
   beyond the scope of this document.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document causes no further security problem for the signaling
   exchanges.  The UPN and UPA messages in this document MUST be
   protected using end-to-end security association(s) offering integrity
   and data origin authentication as speficied in [RFC5213] and
   [RFC7077].

   When the HNP renumbering is triggered, a new HNP SHOULD be allocated
   to the MN.  The LMA MUST follow the procedure of PMIPv6 to make sure
   that only an authorized HNP can be assigned for the MN.  In this way,
   LMA is ready to be the topological anchor point of the new HNP and
   the new HNP is for that MN's exclusive use.

Internet-Draft           PMIPv6 HNP Renumbering               March 2017


   [RFC4862] requires an RA to be authenticated for the Valid Lifetime
   in a Prefix Information Option to be set to less than 2 hours.  Thus,
   when the old HNP that is being deprecated is included in an RA from
   the MAG, it will normally be expected that the Valid Lifetime SHOULD
   be set to 2 hours (and the Preferred Lifetime set to 0) for a non-
   authenticated RA.  However, if the legality of the signaling messages
   exchanged between MAG and MN can be guaranteed, it MAY be acceptable
   to also set the Valid Lifetime to 0 for a non-authenticated RA.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document presents no IANA considerations.
