1. Abstract
                          
   This document highlights some of the issues that should be considered 
   when IPSec [2] and Mobile IP [3] inter-work with each other.  
   This work finds some applications in the following fields: VPN 
   traversal requirement [4], IPSec Remote access client co-located  
   with a Mobile Node, IPSec security Gateway running in parallel with  
   a Home Agent or a MIP Proxy [5]. The purpose of this document is 
   informational. Rather that strictly indicating how both protocol 
   should take advantages of each other (IPSec running on top of Mobile 
   IP or the other way around), which is a subjective task left to the 
   user and implementation developers of both protocol, it rather 
   proposes some usage guidelines and general considerations regarding 
   the preference of one solution over the other one.  
                         
2. Motivation 
                          
   Mobile IP finds an application as tunneling mechanisms for VPN usage: 
   IP encapsulation within IP [5] is indeed a tunneling mechanisms. 
   There is only little change to perform to turn this layer-3 tunneling 
   mechanism into a layer-3 VPN mechanism, basically encryption. Since

Internet Draft  Guidelines for Mobile IP and IPSec Usage   December 2002 
                       
                       
   IPSecÆs ESP provides encryption, many activities early started to 
   evaluate the feasibility of a combination of both protocol [6]. 
   More recently, an increasing demand raised from the so-called mobile 
   VPN area to allow NAT [7] and VPN [3] [8] tunneling for Mobile IP 
   messages especially but not only control (registration) messages. 
   This document describes some implication of an Mobile IP and IPSec 
   integrating picture with regards to network topology and environment. 
   For more information about VPN usage scenarios the reader is invited 
   to check the above mentioned references as well as section 3 of [9]. 
   For the sake of conciseness we restrict our discussion to ESP and 
   confuse the term IPSec Tunnel with ESP encapsulation (In a first 
   approximation, tunnel mode and transport mode are not distinguished). 
   More exactly, when talking about IPSec, this document only means IKE 
   and ESP. 
                          
3. Order of Tunneling 
                          
   There is only two way of co-operation between the IPSec and the 
   Mobile IP stack: Either the IPSec (ESP) tunnel takes place within the 
   Mobile IP tunnel or the other way around, meaning that the Mobile IP 
   tunnel is secured as payload within an ESP tunnel. The following two 
   sections describe those modes and provides pros and cons for each 
   method regarding a mobile VPN deployment. It is assumed that bi-
   directional tunneling (Mobile IP reverse tunneling) is applied [10]. 
                          
3.1. IPSec tunnel inside the Mobile IP tunnel 
                          
   In that case, the tunneling order of figure 1 applies between MN, HA 
   and IPSec/VPN Gateway. Case 1 and 2 differentiate the type of care-
   of-address aquired by the MN, case 1 for co-located care-of-address 
   and case 2 for FA care-of-address.

   2. MN[---------]FA([--------]VPN GW--------)HA---CN

       Figure 1: Mobile IP tunnel in IPSec VPN tunnel 
                         
   The benefit is: 
   - Seamless mobility due to Mobile IP that means real mobility 
     support which is the obvious definition of mobile VPNs. 
     While the drawbacks are: 
   - Since local networks use usually private addresses, NAPT is a 
     major problem. A solution like the one described in [7] needs 
     to be applied 
   - It prevents integration of Mobile IP in already existing 
     IPSec-based VPN products

   - Home FW has to pass through Mobile IP traffic to the HA and 
     therefore to trust the HA, MN and CN which will be  
     unacceptable by system administrators. 
                          
3.2. Mobile IP tunnel inside the IPSec tunnel 
                          
   In that case, the tunneling order of figure 2 applies between MN, HA 
   and IPSec Gateway. Case 1 and 2 differentiate the type of care-of-
   address aquired by the MN, case 1 for co-located care-of-address and 
   case 2 for FA care-of-address. For illustrative purpose, [11] 
   provides a concrete realization of such a procedure.

       Figure 2: IPSec VPN tunnel in Mobile IP tunnel 
                          
   The benefits are:
   - Authentication with the FA based on AAA is useful for a number 
     of business models  
   - NAPT is not a problem for MIP since it is supposed to be 
     solved by the IPSec tunnel [12] 
   - Most Hotspots, ISPs etc. provide DHCP-based (care-of) 
     addresses --> FA are not really a problem 
   - The home FW has full authority to apply corporate policies to 
     the Mobile IP data traffic. 
   While drawbacks are:
   - No seamless mobility 
   - In the case where FA care-of-address is used, security 
     association needs to be hop-by-hop established 
                          
4. Distinction between Mobile IP signaling and data messages 
                          
   Mobile IP control messages, namely agent advertisements, agent 
   solicitations, registration requests and registration replies, are 
   fundamentally different from Mobile IP tunneled packets. Though there 
   is nothing like a signaling channel in the today Internet for this 
   kind of message, finding a way to effectively handle them with a
   special treatment is a benefit since those critical control messages 
   condition all the re-routing of Mobile IP. 
   Considering Mobile IP as a stand alone protocol, this distinction is 
   evident since registration messages are authorized. Concerns have 
   also early raised about the fact that discovery messages (agent 
   advertisement and solicitation) should be made secure i.e. trustful. 
                          
   But considering the global picture where Mobile IP and IPSec work 
   together, there could be a subsidiary distinction, regarding the 
                       
Tessier                     Expires June 2003                   [Page 3] 

Internet Draft  Guidelines for Mobile IP and IPSec Usage   December 2002 
                       
                       
   IPSec policy apply to Mobile IP messages according to their nature: 
   control plane or user plane messages. 
                          
   An illustrative example of that policy is the following one. 
                          
   For outbound packets from the Mobile Node IPSec layer: 
   Apply IPSec to all packet except Mobile IP registration request 
                          
   For outbound packets from the VPN GW IPSec layer: 
   Apply IPSec to all packet except Mobile IP registration request 
                          
   The discrimination rule is done according to the given nature 
   (Transport Protocol and Port Number) of Mobile IP registration 
   messages and IPSec SPD is configured appropriately. 
                         
   This procedure does not add new security threats, with the exception 
   of location privacy, that is no more ensured, since Mobile IP 
   registration packets are only authenticated and not cyphered. 
   Moreover, such a distinction may be needed in some deployment 
   scenarios: For example, encrypting Mobile IP registration messages 
   between Mobile Node and VPN Gateway will indeed prohibit Foreign 
   Agents, if present, to understand them (see the drawbacks of section 
   3.2.). 
                          
5. Cooperation between both tunneling 
                       
   There is no fundamental motivation for excluding one or the other way 
   of ordering the IP in IP and the ESP tunneling mechanism in one order 
   or the other. Section 8 illustrates that the level of security in one 
   configuration or in the other is the same or at least comparable in 
   its effective realization. 
                          
   From a purely design perspective, there is no restriction of applying 
   IPSec to an IP in IP encapsulated packet. Touch and Eggert already 
   considered that problematic in [13] and concluded that great 
   attention should be put on how the IPSec policy is apply, though 
   their work was not related to Mobile IP itself. Here is quotted a 
   very useful statement from Annex A: 
                          
   ôThere are inconsistencies between the IPIP encapsulation rules 
   specified by IPsec and those specified by Mobile IP. The latter 
   specification is standards track, and the IP protocol number of 4 
   (payload of an IP packet of type 4) is assigned by IANA to RFC 2003 
   [5]. IPsec does not specify any limits on the types of IP packets 
   which can be secured by transport mode, so the use of IPIP inside an 
   IPsec transport packet can be confused with IPsec tunnel mode.ö 
                          
6. Network Topology 
                          
   There maybe situation where the network topology itself will dictate 
   the way how IPSec and Mobile IP should work together.

Internet Draft  Guidelines for Mobile IP and IPSec Usage   December 2002 
                       
                       
   Corporate LANs very often use NAT and therefore private addresses or 
   non-globally routable addresses. However NA(P)T is a well-known nasty 
   problem and it might even be impossible to find out a single 
   unambiguous outer identifier on behalf of NATted hosts [14].  
   The type (private or public) of the care-of-address and the fact that 
   this type could be predict by specific usage scenario (type of 
   visited network, e.g. cellular link, hot-spot) is also a criteria 
   that should influence the way the Security Association should be 
   renew/refresh after movement of the end terminal and the subsequent 
   IP-subnet change. 
                         
7. Mobile IPv6 Consideration 
                          
   Since the problems motivating this document are inherent to IPv4 
   Mobile IPv4 and since a rough consensus as well as a original design 
   intention seem both to state that Mobile IPv6 will solve these 
   problems, no considerations is here made about Mobile IPv6. 
   [15] provides some guidelines about interaction between IPSec and 
   Mobile IPv6.  
                          
8. Security Considerations 
                       
   This document consider the usage of IPSec and therefore adopt the 
   considerations of RFC2401. 
   The fundamental requirement driving the way both protocol should work 
   together is security: No new threat should be added in one solution 
   with regard to the other one. 
   Table 1 compares both way of cooperation -IPSec in Mobile IP or the 
   other way around- in a security perspective with the indication of 
   possible mechanisms used for ensuring given non-exhaustive security 
   services.

   Note that privacy is here to be understood in the sense of identity 
   protection. Note that Mobile IP differentiates between control plane  
   and user plane packets and that without IPSec, security services are 
   only provided to control plane packets.  
                          
   A deeper analyze is needed before drawing any conclusion (besides the 
   fact that the author does not consider himself as a security expert) 
   whether one solution could be more secure than the other but it 
   should already be clear that the mechanisms themselves are comparable 
   in their realization e.g. in both cases ESP is used for 
   confidentiality.  
                                                    
   Indeed, the future task could be answering the following question: 
   Does an IP-in-IP encapsulation eliminate the security benefits 
   provided by ESP?  
                                                  
   The following statement should be considered: Mobile IP should 
   leverage off of the developments of IPSec rather than developing its 
   own security framework.
