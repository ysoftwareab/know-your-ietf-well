use with network management protocols in the Internet community.  In
particular, it describes managed objects used for managing multicast
address allocation.

Draft               Multicast Address Allocation MIB           June 2002


2.  Introduction

This document defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
managing multicast address allocation in a protocol-independent manner,
as well as for managing specific protocols used in allocating multicast
addresses.  The protocol-independent objects in this MIB apply to all
multicast address allocation servers (MAASs) and clients, as described
in [ARCH], including those that allocate source-specific multicast
addresses for the local machine.

The protocol-specific objects in this MIB include objects related to the
Multicast Address Dynamic Client Allocation Protocol (MADCAP) [MADCAP].
Interactions with the Multicast-scope Zone Announcement Protocol (MZAP)
[MZAP] are also noted where appropriate.


3.  The SNMP Management Framework

   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:

    o   An overall architecture, described in RFC 2571 [RFC2571].

    o   Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
        purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
        Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
        STD 16, RFC 1155 [RFC1155], STD 16, RFC 1212 [RFC1212] and RFC
        1215 [RFC1215].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
        in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and
        STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].

    o   Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
        first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1 and
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second version of
        the SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
        track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
        [RFC1901] and RFC 1906 [RFC1906].  The third version of the
        message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
        [RFC1906], RFC 2572 [RFC2572] and RFC 2574 [RFC2574].

    o   Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
        first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
        described in STD 15, RFC 1157 [RFC1157].  A second set of
        protocol operations and associated PDU formats is described in
        RFC 1905 [RFC1905].

Draft               Multicast Address Allocation MIB           June 2002


    o   A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2573
        [RFC2573] and the view-based access control mechanism described
        in RFC 2575 [RFC2575].

   A more detailed introduction to the current SNMP Management Framework
   can be found in RFC 2570 [RFC2570].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB are
   defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.

   This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A
   MIB conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions in
   SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of machine
   readable information is not considered to change the semantics of the
   MIB.


4.  Overview

The purpose of this MIB module is to provide the ability to configure
and monitor the status of multicast address allocation within the local
domain.

Some important monitoring questions which can be answered by this MIB
module include:

o    How full is scope X?

o    Who's using up the space?

o    Who allocated a given address A?

o    Are requests being met?

This MIB module is divided into two primary sections:

o    Protocol-independent objects relevant to all multicast address
     allocation servers and clients.

Draft               Multicast Address Allocation MIB           June 2002


o    Protocol-specific objects related to the MADCAP client-server
     protocol.


4.1.  Protocol-independent objects

The protocol-independent objects consist of one "capabilities" scalar
and five tables.  The tables are:

o    The Scope Table contains information on the multicast scopes known
     to a multicast address allocation server.  This table allows
     configuring scopes, and viewing what scopes are known to the local
     system after being configured elsewhere.

o    The Scope Name Table contains the names of the multicast scopes.
     This table logically extends the Scope Table with the list of scope
     names in various languages for each scope.

o    The Allocation Range Table contains the address ranges out of which
     the device may allocate addresses.  It also allows answering the
     questions "How full is scope X?" and "Are requests being met?"

o    The Request Table contains the requests for address allocations,
     and allows answering the question "Who's using up the space?"

o    The Address Table contains the blocks of addresses which have been
     allocated, and together with the Request Table, allows answering
     the question "Who allocated a given address A?"


4.2.  Protocol-specific objects

The MADCAP objects consist of a group of (scalar) configuration
parameters, and a group of (scalar) statistics.

6.  IANA Considerations

The IANAscopeSource and IANAmallocRangeSource textual conventions are
imported from the IANA-MALLOC-MIB.  The purpose of defining these
textual conventions in a separate MIB module is to allow additional
values to be defined without having to issue a new version of this
document.  The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible
for the assignment of all Internet numbers, including various SNMP-
related numbers; it will administer the values associated with these
textual conventions.

The rules for additions or changes to the IANA-MALLOC-MIB are outlined
in the DESCRIPTION clause associated with its MODULE-IDENTITY statement.

The current versions of the IANA-MALLOC-MIB can be accessed from the
IANA home page at: "http://www.iana.org/".


7.  Security Considerations

This MIB contains readable objects whose values provide information
related to multicast address allocation.  There are also a number of
objects that have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create,
such as those which allow an administrator to dynamically configure
ranges from which to allocate addresses.

If address allocation servers are configured to allow renewal or release
purely on the basis of knowledge of the Lease Identifier contained in
the Request and Address tables, then unauthorized read access to these
objects can be used in a denial-of-service attack.

While unauthorized read access to the remaining objects is relatively
innocuous, unauthorized write access to these objects could cause a
denial-of-service, or could cause unauthorized creation and/or
manipulation of scope ranges.

Draft               Multicast Address Allocation MIB           June 2002


Hence, the support for SNMP operations in a non-secure environment
without proper protection can have a negative effect on network
operations.

SNMPv1 by itself is such an insecure environment.  Even if the network
itself is secure (for example by using IPSec [IPSEC]), even then, there
is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to access and
SET (change/create/delete) the objects in this MIB.

It is recommended that the implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework.  Specifically, the use of the User-
based Security Model RFC 2574 [RFC2574] and the View-based Access
Control Model RFC 2575 [RFC2575] is recommended.

It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity
giving access to this MIB, is properly configured to give access to
those objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
rights to access them.

    DESCRIPTION
            "This MIB module defines the IANAscopeSource and
            IANAmallocRangeSource textual conventions for use in MIBs
            which need to identify ways of learning multicast scope and
            range information.

            Any additions or changes to the contents of this MIB module
            require either publication of an RFC, or Designated Expert
            Review as defined in the Guidelines for Writing IANA
            Considerations Section document.  The Designated Expert will
            be selected by the IESG Area Director(s) of the Transport
