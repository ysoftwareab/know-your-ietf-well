 1. Introduction  
   
 This document defines extension to the PWE3 control protocol [RFC4446] 
 and PWE3 IANA allocations [RFC4446] required for setup of  
 TDM pseudowires.  
   
 Structure-agnostic TDM pseudowires have been specified in [RFC4553]  
 and structure-aware ones in [PWE3-CESoPSN] and [PWE3-TDMoIP].  
   
 [RFC4447] defines extensions to LDP [RFC3036] that are required to  
 exchange PW labels for PWs emulating various Layer 2 services  
 (Ethernet, FR, ATM, HDLC etc.). Setup of TDM PWs requires both  
 interpretation of the existing information elements of these extensions  
 and exchange of additional information.   
   
 Setup of TDM PWs using L2TPv3 will be defined in a separate document.  
   
 Status of attachment circuits of TDM PWs can be exchanged between the  
 terminating PEs using the mechanism defined in [RFC4447] without any 
 changes. However, usage of these mechanisms with TDM PWs is NOT 
 RECOMMENDED since indication of status of the TDM attachment circuits 
 is carried in-band in the data plane.  
  
 The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
 "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
 document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

 2. PW FEC for Setup of TDM PWs  
   
 [RFC4447] uses LDP Label Mapping message [RFC3036] for advertising  
 the FEC-to-PW Label binding, and defines two types of PW FEC that can  
 be used for this purpose: 
  
  
 1. PWId FEC (FEC 128). This FEC contains:  
     a) PW type  
     b) Control bit (indicates presence of the control word)  
     c) Group ID   
     d) PW ID  
     e) Interface parameters  
 2. Generalized PW FEC (FEC 129). This FEC contains only:  
     a) PW type  
     b) Control bit  
     c) AGI, SAII and TAII that replace the PW ID  
       
 The Group ID and the Interface parameters are contained in separate  
 TLVs, called the PW Grouping TLV and the Interface Parameters TLV.   
   
 Both types of PW FEC MAY be used for setup of TDM PWs with appropriate  
 selection of PW types and interface parameters.   
   
   
 The PW Types for TDM PWs are allocated in [RFC4446] as follows:  
   
 o  0x0011  Structure-agnostic E1 over Packet [RFC4553]   
 o  0x0012  Structure-agnostic T1 (DS1) over Packet [RFC4553]  
 o  0x0013  Structure-agnostic E3 over Packet [RFC4553]  
 o  0x0014  Structure-agnostic T3 (DS3) over Packet [RFC4553]  
 o  0x0015  CESoPSN basic mode [PWE3-CESoPSN]  
 o  0x0016  TDMoIP AAL1 mode [PWE3-TDMoIP]  
 o  0x0017  CESoPSN TDM with CAS [PWE3-CESoPSN]  
 o  0x0018  TDMoIP AAL2 mode [PWE3-TDMoIP]  
   
 The two endpoints MUST agree on the PW type, as both directions of the  
 PW are required to be of the same type.  
   
 The Control bit MUST always be set for TDM PWs since all TDM PW  
 encapsulations always use a control word. 
  
 3. Interface Parameters for TDM PWs 
    3.1. CEP/TDM Payload Bytes (0x04) 
  
 This parameter is used for setup of all SAToP and CESoPSN PWs (i.e. PW 
 types 0x0011, 0x0012, 0x0013, 0x0014, 0x0015 and 0x0017) and employs 
 the following semantics: 
  
 This parameter is used for setup of all SAToP and CESoPSN PWs (i.e. PW  
 types 0x0011, 0x0012, 0x0013, 0x0014, 0x0015 and 0x0017) with the  
 following semantics:

 Control Protocol Extensions for Setup of TDM Pseudowires October 2006 
           
 1. The two endpoints of a TDM PW MUST agree on the same value of this 
     parameter for the PW to be set up successfully.  
 2. Presence of this parameter in the PWId FEC or in the Interface 
     Parameters Field TLV is OPTIONAL. If this parameter is omitted, 
     default payload size defined for the corresponding service (see 
     [RFC4553], [PWE3-CESoPSN]) MUST be assumed  
 3. For structure-agnostic emulation, any value consistent with the MTU 
     of the underlying PSN MAY be specified 
  
 4. For CESoPSN PWs:  
     a) The specified value P MUST be an integer multiple of N, where N 
        is the number of timeslots in the attachment circuit  
     b) For trunk-specific NxDS0 with CAS:  
        i)   (P/N) MUST be an integer factor of the number of frames per 
           corresponding trunk multiframe (i.e. 16 for an E1 trunk and 
           24 of a T1 trunk)  
        ii)  The size of the signaling sub-structure is not accounted 
           for in the specified value P. 
  
    3.2. CEP/TDM Bit-Rate (0x07) 
  
 This interface parameter represents the bit-rate of the TDM service in  
 multiples of the "basic" 64 Kbit/s rate. Its usage for all types of TDM  
 PWs assumes the following semantics:  
   
 1. This interface parameter MAY be omitted if the attachment circuit  
     bit-rate can be unambiguously derived from the PW Type (i.e. for  
     structure-agnostic emulation of E1, E3 and T3 circuits). If this  
     value is omitted for the structure-agnostic emulation of T1 PW  
     Type, the basic emulation mode MUST be assumed.  
 2. If present, only the following values MUST be specified for  
     structure-agnostic emulation (see [RFC4553]:  
     a) Structure-agnostic E1 emulation  - 32   
     b) Structure-agnostic T1 emulation:  
        i)   MUST be set to 24 in the basic emulation mode   
        ii)  MUST be set to 25 for the "Octet-aligned T1" emulation mode  
     c) Structure-agnostic E3 emulation  - 535  
     d) Structure-agnostic T3 emulation  - 699  
 3. For all kinds of structure-aware emulation, this parameter MUST be  
     set to N where N is the number of DS0 channels in the corresponding  
     attachment circuit.  
   
 Note: The value 24 does not represent the actual bit-rate of the T1  
 circuit (1,544 Mbit/s) in units of 64 kbit/s. The values mentioned  
 above are used for convenience. 
  
    3.3. Number of TDMoIP AAL1 cells per packet (0x0D - subject to 
      IANA approval) 
  
 This parameter MAY be present for TDMoIP AAL1 mode PWs (PW type 0x0016) 
 and specifies the number of 48-byte AAL1 PDUs per MPLS packet. Any 
 values consistent with the MTU of the underlying PSN MAY be specified. 
 If this parameter is not specified it defaults to 1 PDU per packet for

 Control Protocol Extensions for Setup of TDM Pseudowires October 2006 
           
 low bit-rates (CEP/TDM Bit-Rate less than or equal to 32), and to 5 for 
 high bit-rates (CEP/TDM Bit-Rate of 535 or 699). 
  
  
  
  
    3.4. TDMoIP AAL1 mode (0x0E - subject to IANA approval) 
  
 This parameter MAY be present for TDMoIP AAL1 mode PWs (PW type 0x0016) 
 and specifies the AAL1 mode. If this parameter is not present, the AAL1 
 mode defaults to "structured". When specified, the values have the 
 following significance: 
    0 unstructured AAL1 
    2 structured AAL1 
    3 structured AAL1 with CAS. 
 The two endpoints MUST agree on the TDMoIP AAL1 mode. 
  
  
    3.5. TDMoIP AAL2 Options (0x0F - subject to IANA approval) 
  
 This parameter MUST be present for TDMoIP AAL2 mode PWs (PW type 
 0x0018) and has the following format: 
  
     0                   1                   2                   3

    |    0x0F       |    Length     | V |      ENCODING             |

    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
  
 The fields in this parameter are defined as follows: 
  
 V defines the VAD capabilities. Its values have the following 
 significance: 
      0 means that the CID is only switched by signaling 
      1 means that voice activity detection is employed 
      3 means this channel is always active. In particular, this channel 
      may be used for timing recovery. 
  
 Encoding specifies native signal processing performed on the payload. 
 When no native signal processing is performed (i.e. G.711 encoding) 
 this field MUST be zero. 
  
 Maximum Duration specifies the maximum time allowed for filling an AAL2 
 PDU, in units of 125 microseconds. For unencoded 64 kbps channels this 
 numerically equals the maximum number of bytes per PDU, and MUST be 
 less than 64. For other encoding parameters, larger values may be 
 attained.

 CID mapping bases is an OPTIONAL parameter, its existence and length 
 determined by the length field. If the mapping of AAL2 CID values to 
 physical interface and time slot is statically configured, or if AAL2 
 switching [Q.2630.1] is employed, this parameter MUST NOT appear. When 
 it is present, and the channels belong to N physical interfaces (i.e. N 
 E1s or T1s), it MUST be N bytes in length. Each byte represents a 
 number to be subtracted from the CID to get the timeslot number for 
 each physical interface. For example, if the CID mapping bases 
 parameter consists of the bytes 20 and 60, this signifies that timeslot 
 1 of trunk 1 corresponds to CID 21 and timeslot 1 of trunk 2 is called 
 61. 
  
  
    3.6. Fragmentation Indicator (0x09) 
  
 This interface parameter is specified in [RFC4446] and its usage is 
 explained in [RFC4623]. It MUST be omitted in the FEC of all TDM PWs 
 excluding trunk-specific NxDS0 services with CAS using the CESoPSN 
 encapsulation. In case of these services, it MUST be present in the PW 
 FEC if the payload size specified value P differs from Nx(number of 
 frames per trunk multiframe). 
  
  
    3.7. TDM Options (0x0B) 
  
 This is a new interface parameter. Its Interface Parameter ID has to be 
 assigned by IANA, and its format is shown in Fig. 1 below: 
  
     0                   1                   2                   3

 Parameter ID       Identifies the TDM PW Options interface parameter, 
                     value TBA by IANA 
 Length             4, 8 or 12 (see below) 
 R                  The RTP Header Usage bit: if set, indicates that 
                     the PW endpoint distributing this FEC expects to 
                     receive RTP header in the encapsulation. RTP header 
                     will be used only if both endpoints expect to 
                     receive it. If this bit is cleared, Length MUST be 
                     set to 4, otherwise it MUST be either 8 or 12 (see 
                     below). If the peer PW end point cannot meet this 
                     requirement, the Label Mapping message containing 
                     the FEC in question MUST be rejected with the 
                     appropriate status code (see Section 4 below). 
 D                  The Dynamic Timestamping Mode bit: if set, 
                     indicates that the PW endpoint distributing this 
                     FEC expects the peer to use Differential 
                     timestamping mode in the packets sent to it. If the 
                     peer PW end point cannot meet this requirement, the 
                     Label Mapping message containing the FEC in 
                     question MUST be rejected with the appropriate 
                     status code (see Section 4 below). 
 F, X               Reserved for future extensions. MUST be cleared 
                     when distributed and MUST be ignored upon reception 
 SP                 Encodes support for the CESoPSN signaling packets 
                     (see [PWE3-CESoPSN]):  
                     o  '00' for PWs that do not use signaling packets 
                     o  '01' for CESoPSN PWs carrying TDM data packets 
                        and expecting CE application signaling packets 
                        in a separate PW 
                     o  '10' for a PW carrying CE application signaling 
                        packets with the data packets in a separate PW 
                     o  '11' - for CESoPSN PWs carrying TDM data and CE 
                        application signaling on the same PW 
 CAS                MUST be cleared for all types of TDM PWs excluding 
                     trunk-specific NxDS0 services with CAS. For these 
                     services it encodes the trunk framing like 
                     following: 
                     o  '01' - an E1 trunk 
                     o  '10' - a T1/ESF trunk 
                     o  '11' - a T1 SF trunk 
 RSVD-1 and RSVD-2  Reserved bits, MUST be set to 0 by the PW endpoint 
                     distributing this FEC and MUST be ignored by the 
                     receiver 
 PT                 Indicates the value of Payload Type in the RTP 
                     header expected by the PW endpoint distributing 
                     this FEC. Value 0 means that PT value check will 
                     not be used for detecting malformed packets 
 FREQ               Frequency of timestamping clock in units of 8 kHz 
 SSRC               Indicates the value of SSRC ID in the RTP header 
                     expected by the PW endpoint distributing this FEC. 
                     Value 0 means that SSRC ID value check will not be 
                     used for detecting misconnections. Alternatively, 
                     Length can be set to 8 in this case.

 Notes: 
  
 1. This interface parameter MAY be omitted in the following cases: 
     a) SAToP PWs that do not use RTP header [RFC4553] 
     b) Basic CESoPSN NxDS0 services without CE application signaling 
        [PWE3-CESoPSN] 
     c) TDMoIP AAL1 mode 0 or 2 PWs that do not use RTP. 
     d) TDMoIP AAL2 PWs that do not relay CAS signaling and do not use 
        RTP. 
 2. This interface parameter MUST be present in the following cases: 
     a) All TDM PWs that use RTP header 
     b) CESoPSN PWs that carry basic NxDS0 services and use CESoPSN 
        signaling packets to carry CE application signaling. This case 
        is discussed in detail in Section 4 below 
     c) CESoPSN PWs that carry trunk-specific NxDS0 services with CAS 
     d) TDMoIP AAL1 mode 1 PWs 
     e) TDMoIP AAL2 PWs that relay CAS signaling.  
 3. If RTP header and Differential timestamping mode are used, the 
     value of the Length field MUST be set to 8 or 12 in order to 
     include at least the Timestamping Clock Frequency field in the 
     value 
 4. A TDM PW encapsulation MUST either use or not use RTP in both 
     directions. However, it is possible to use Differential 
     timestamping mode in just one direction of the PW.  
  
  
 4. Extending CESoPSN Basic NxDS0 Services with CE Application 
    Signaling 
  
 [PWE3-CESoPSN] defines that basic NxDS0 services can be extended to 
 carry also CE application signaling (e.g., CAS) in separate signaling 
 packets carried in a separate PW. 
  
 The following rules define setup of matching pairs of CESoPSN PWs using 
 the PW Id FEC and the extensions defined above: 
  
 1. The value of PW ID for the CESoPSN PW carrying TDM data packets 
     MUST be even 
 2. The value of PW ID for the CESoPSN PW carrying CE application 
     signaling MUST be the next odd value for the (even) value of PW ID 
     for the CESoPSN PW carrying TDM data packets 
 3. The two PWs MUST: 
     a) Have the same PW Type 
     b) Have the same values of all the Interface Parameters with the 
        exception of the code point in the SP field of the TDM Options 
        parameter.  
        i)   The PWId FEC of the PW carrying TDM data packets must be 
           marked with SP bits set to '01' in this field 
        ii)  The PWId FEC of the PW carrying CE signaling packets must 
           be marked with SP bits set to '10' in this field.

 If only one of the two PWs required to carry a CESoPSN basic NxDS0 
 service and associated CE signaling packets has been established and 
 the other one failed, the established PW MUST be torn down. 
  
 Setup of CESoPSN PWs with CE application signaling using the 
 Generalized PW FEC is left for further study. 
  
  
 5. LDP Status Codes 
  
 In addition to the status codes defined in section 5.3 of [RFC4447], 
 the following status codes defined in [RFC4446] MUST be used to 
 indicate the reason of failure to establish a TDM PW: 
  
 1. Incompatible bit rate: 
     a) In the case of mismatch of T1 encapsulation modes (basic vs. 
        octet-aligned) 
     b) In case of mismatch in the number of timeslots for NxDS0 basic 
        services or trunk-specific NxDS0 services with CAS 
 2. CEP/TDM mis-configuration: 
     a) In the case of mismatch in the desired usage of RTP header 
     b) In the case of mismatch of the desired timestamping clock 
        frequency 
     c) In the case of mismatch of expected signaling packets behavior 
        for basic CESoPSN NxDS0 services extended to carry CE 
        application signaling in separate signaling packets 
     d) In the case of trunk-specific NxDS0 services with CAS if the 
        framing types of the trunks are different 
     e) In the case of TDMoIP AAL1 PWs with different AAL1 modes 
        specified by the end points 
  
 In cases 2a, 2b, 2c and 2e above, the user MAY reconfigure the end 
 points and attempt to setup the PW once again. 
  
 In the case 2d the failure is fatal. 
  
 Note that setting of the Control bit (see section 2 above) to zero MUST 
 result in an LDP status of "Illegal C-Bit". 
  
 6. Using the PW Status TLV 
  
 The TDM PW control word carries status indications for both attachment 
 circuits (L and M fields) and the PSN (R field) (see [RFC4553], [PWE3-
 CESoPSN] and [PWE3-TDMoIP]). Similar functionality is available via use 
 of the PW Status TLV (see [RFC4447], Section 5.4.2).  
  
 If the latter mechanism is employed, the signaling PE sends to its peer 
 a PW Status TLV, setting the appropriate bits (see [RFC4446], Section 
 3.5): 
  
    o Pseudowire Not Forwarding 
    o Local Attachment Circuit (ingress) Receive Fault 
    o Local Attachment Circuit (egress) Transmit Fault

 Control Protocol Extensions for Setup of TDM Pseudowires October 2006 
           
    o Local PSN-facing PW (ingress) Receive Fault  
    o Local PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit Fault. 
  
 As long as the TDM PW interworking function is operational, usage of 
 the Status TLV is NOT RECOMMENDED in order to avoid contention between 
 status indications reported by the data and control plane. However, if 
 the TDM PW interworking function (IWF) itself fails while the PWE3 
 control plane remains operational, Status TLV with all of the above 
 bits set SHOULD be sent. 
  
 7. IANA Considerations 
  
 Most of the IANA assignments required by this draft are already listed 
 in [RFC4446]. Additional assignments are required for three Interface 
 Parameters Sub-TLV type values (see Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5): 
  
    o Number of TDMoIP AAL1 cells per packet (suggested value - 0x0D) 
    o TDMoIP AAL1 mode (suggested value - 0x0E) 
    o TDMoIP AAL2 Options (suggested value - 0x0F). 
  
 8. Security Considerations 
  
 This draft does not have any additional impact on security of PWs above 
 that of basic LDP setup of PWs.
