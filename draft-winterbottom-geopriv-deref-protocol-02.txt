Abstract

   This document describes how to use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
   (HTTP) over Transport Layer Security (TLS) as a dereferencing
   protocol to resolve a reference into a Presence Information Data
   Format Location Object (PIDF-LO).  The document assumes that a
   Location Recipient possesses a secure HELD URI that can be used in
   conjunction with the HELD protocol to request the location of the
   Target.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes how to transport Presence Information Data
   Format Location Object (PIDF-LO) when dereferencing a location URI in
   the form of a secure HELD URI (held:  URI scheme) [1].  This held:
   URI indicates that the XML-based HELD messages are carried on top of
   the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is secured using
   Transport Layer Security (TLS) ([2] and [3]).

   The document describes how HELD [1] is used to request and to receive
   location information in a way that also satisfies the requirements
   laid out in [7].  HELD provides location information in the form of a
   PIDF-LO (see [4]) which, as part of its definition, complies with the
   requirements of a location object as described in [8].

   To use HELD as a dereferencing protocol has the advantage that the
   Location Recipient can indicate the type of location information it
   would like to receive.  This functionality is already available with
   the HELD base specification, described in [1].  Furthermore, the HELD
   response from the LIS towards the Location Recipient not only
   provides the PIDF-LO but also encapsulates supplementary information,
   such as error messages, back to the Location Recipient.

   The general usage scenario envisioned by this document is shown in
   Figure 1.  While the figure shows a typical HELD location request
   being made to initially obtain the location URI.  As Figure 1
   indicates, an alternative Location Configuration Protocol (LCP) that
   can provide a HELD URI can be used.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [5].

   The key conventions and terminology used in this document are defined
   as follows:

   This document reuses the term Target, as defined in [8].

   This document uses the term Location Information Server, LIS, as the
   node in the access network providing location information to an end
   point, or to the node dereferencing a location URI.  This term is
   also used in [9].

   The Location Recipient acts as a HELD client and the LIS as a HELD
   server in the context of this document.

   Many architectural descriptions related to the updated terminology of
   RFC 3693 can be found in [10].

3.  Authorization Models

   This section discusses two extreme types of authorization models for
   dereferencing with HELD URIs, namely "Authorization by Possession"
   and "Authorization via Access Control Lists".  In the subsequent
   subsections we discuss the properties of these two models.  These two
   models can, however, be used in combination in a real deployment.
   Figure 2 shows the communication model relevant for this discussion.
   It is a simplified version of Figure 1 from [7].

                       Figure 2: Communication Model

   It is important to note that this document does not mandate a
   specific authorization model nor does it constraint the usage with
   regard to these models in any way.  Additionally, it is possible to
   combine certain parts of both models.

3.1.  Authorization by Possession

   With this type of authorization model the communication steps with
   respect to Figure 2 are as follows.  We focus on the description of
   the case where the Location URI is dereferenced by an entity other
   than the Target.

   1.  The Target discovers the LIS.

   2.  The Target sends a request to the LIS asking for a location-by-
       reference, as shown in (1) of Figure 2.




Winterbottom, et al.    Expires January 15, 2009                [Page 6]

Internet-Draft        HTTPS Dereferencing Protocol             July 2008


   3.  The LIS responds to the request and returns a Location URI.  This
       reference fullfills the requirements indicated in [7], in
       particular it must be non-guessable (see requirement C9 of [7]).

   4.  The Target then conveys the Location URI to a third party, the
       Location Recipient (for example using SIP as described in [11]).
       This step is shown in (2) of Figure 2.

   5.  The Location Recipient then needs to dereference the Location URI
       in order to obtain the Location Object.  Depending on the URI
       scheme of the Location URI this might, for example in case of a
       HELD URI, be done as described in this document.

   The last step where the LIS has to decide whether to resolve the
   reference and to return the Location Object to the entity asking for
   it is important.  With this authorization model there is the
   assumption that the possession of the Location URI by the Location
   Recipient alone is sufficient, from an authorization point of view,
   to grant access to the Location Object that is being referenced by
   the Location URI.  As such, the Location Recipient authenticates the
   LIS using TLS server-side authentication but no authentication from
   the Location Recipient point of view is demanded.

   A few aspects are worth further discussion when the Target would like
   to avoid unrestricted disclosure of it's location information.

   o  First, the Target is able to control the disclosure of location
      information by making the Location URI available only to selected
      entities.

   o  Second, in order to deal with adversary along the signaling path
      between the Target and the Location Recipient the properties of
      the using protocol need to be taken advantage of.  For example,
      the Location URI may be encrypted end-to-end using S/MIME and
      consequently only the entity that is able to decrypt the protected
      object can resolve the reference.  Depending on the usage of the
      Location URI for certain location based applications (e.g.,
      emergency services, location based routing) specific treatment is
      important, as discussed in [11].

   o  Finally, the Target can place restrictions on the URI itself.  For
      example, the Target may put rules around how long the URI can live
      for, how many times the URI may be dereferences, or indeed,
      precisely what the URI will reveal when accessed.  That is, the
      properties or the URI and policies invoked by the URI determine
      what the recipient receives, regardless of any identification that
      the recipient may present to the LIS.

Internet-Draft        HTTPS Dereferencing Protocol             July 2008


3.2.  Authorization via Access Control Lists

   In this model the communication steps are slightly different, as
   shown below.

   1.  The procedure again starts with the Target performing the LIS
       discovery procedure.

   2.  The Target sends a request to the LIS asking for a location-by-
       reference, as shown in (1) of Figure 2.

   3.  Before handing out the reference the Target uploads authorization
       policies to the LIS that aim to control access to the
       dereferencing step.  A possible format for these authorization
       policies is available with GEOPRIV Common Policy [12] and
       Geolocation Policy [13].  Additional policies are described in
       [14] that allow constraints to be placed on the dereferencing
       procedure to limit the location information being exposed to
       Location Recipients.

   4.  The LIS responds to the request and returns a Location URI.  With
       the uploaded authorization policies in place there are no
       requirements for the Location URI to be non-guessable.

   5.  The Target then conveys the Location URI to a third party, the
       Location Recipient (for example using SIP as described in [11]).
       This step is shown in (2) of Figure 2.

   6.  The Location Recipient then needs to dereference the Location URI
       in order to obtain the Location Object.  Depending on the
       specific content of the authorization policies (such as identity-
       based conditions in the policy rule set) the Location Recipient
       has to be authenticated in order to allow the authorization check
       to continue.

4.  Steps for Retrieval

   When a Location Recipient obtains a Location URI with the "held:" URI
   scheme then the following steps for dereferencing the Location URI
   are being executed:

   1.  The Location Recipient, acting as a HELD client, determines the
       IP address of the LIS based on the obtained Location URI
       following the procedure described in Section 3 of [15].

   2.  The HELD client establishes a TLS connection to the LIS, as
       described in [3].  The TLS ciphersuite TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL
       MUST NOT be used.

   3.  When certificate based authentication is used the client
       authenticates the server and compares the domain part of the
       Location URI with the identity information in the certificate.

   4.  The server MAY require the client to be authenticated.  This
       could, for example, be useful in deployment environments where
       certain Location Recipients are granted access to location
       information only or where access control rules have to be
       executed as part of the authorization procedure.  Various
       authentication mechanisms for HTTP exist and this document does
       not restrict them in any way since the preferred mechanism may be
       deployment specific.

   5.  The client retrieves the PIDF-LO document encapsulated into the
       HELD locationResponse or an error message conveyed in a HELD
       error message.

   The subsequent text describes how HELD protected by TLS can be used
   to qualify location requests to the LIS.  Only a subset of HELD
   functionality is required and is described in the following
   paragraphs.  The HELD based dereferencing step provides ways to tell
   the LIS what information is desired and allows the LIS to communicate
   additional information back to the client.

   The <locationType> element allows location to be requested in a
   specific form, such as civic or geodetic location information.  The
   Location Recipient SHOULD NOT request location as a locationURI.  The
   LIS MUST respond with a "requestError" if it receives a request for a
   locationURI where HELD is being used as a dereference protocol.
   Location information provided by the LIS MUST correspond to the rules
   and guidelines in [6].  If the requested form of location violates
   any authorization policies known to the LIS, then the LIS MUST
   respond with a "cannotProvideLiType" error.

Internet-Draft        HTTPS Dereferencing Protocol             July 2008


   The LIS will provide location information on request even if the
   location information does not fit the form requested.  This stems
   from the premise that some location is better than no location.  HELD
   provides a means for the requestor to modify this behaviour and
   instruct the LIS to return an error if location information is not
   available in the form requested.  This is done using the "exact"
   attribute.

   Location systems often have more than one location determination
   mechanism at their disposal.  Differing determination techniques
   provide different degrees of accuracy over differing periods of time.
   Generally, more accurate determination techniques require more time.
   HELD addresses this trade-off by allowing the requestor to specify
   how long they are prepared to wait for a location result.  This
   allows the LIS to select the most accurate determination technique at
   its disposal that can return a result in the specified time.  The
   HELD attribute for specifying this value is the "responseTime"
   attribute and MAY be used by a Location Recipient to specify their
   preference for the accuracy-time trade-off.

   The LIS MUST support the HELD locationRequest semantic using an HTTP
   GET as described in [1].  The usage of HTTP POST is optional.

   Where the LIS is unable to process the Location Recipient's request,
   it MUST return the appropriate error from the existing HELD error set
   defined in [1].

5.  Examples

   This example in Figure 3 shows the most basic rereferencing request
   for a LO.  This uses the GET feature described by the HTTP binding
   from Section 9 of [1].  This example assumes that the LO is available
   for retrieval at the URL
   "https://lis.example.com/357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o".


            GET held://lis.example.com:80/357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o HTTP/1.1
            Host: lis.example.com
            Accept:application/held+xml,
                   application/xml;q=0.8,
                   text/xml;q=0.7
            Accept-Charset: UTF-8,*

                Figure 3: Minimal GET Dereferencing Request

   The GET request is exactly identical to a minimal POST request that
   includes an empty "locationRequest" element.


          POST held://lis.example.com:80/357yc6s64ceyoiuy5ax3o HTTP/1.1
          Host: lis.example.com
          Accept: application/held+xml,
                  application/xml;q=0.8,
                  text/xml;q=0.7
          Accept-Charset: UTF-8,*
          Content-Type: application/held+xml
          Content-Length: 83

          <?xml version="1.0"?>
          <locationRequest xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:geopriv:held"/>

               Figure 4: Minimal POST Dereferencing Request

   Figure 5 shows a request indicating that both civic and geodetic
   location information has to be returned.  If it cannot be provided,
   the request fails.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document assumes that the use of TLS to protect HTTP is
   sufficient to protect the privacy of the PIDF-LO content while in
   flight.  When access control at the LIS is not applied, as described
   in Section 3.1, then the possession of the location URI is equal to
   the possession of location information.  When the requirements for
   creating a location URI, as described in [7], are met, then the
   reference provides sufficiently high security guarantees for most
   location-based applications.  Furthermore, the ability of the Rule
   Maker to put constraints on the dereferencing step, as described in
   [14], provides the ability to restrict how often location can be
   accessed through a location URI, how long the URI is valid for, and
   the type of location information returned when a location URI is
   accessed.  If this is still not sufficient then the Target is able to
   put authorization policies either to the LIS or uploads the Location
   URI to a presence server that hosts authorization policies, as
   described in [16].

   Connection establishment from the Location Recipient to the LIS will
   be made using HTTP over TLS, and the location URI being dereferenced
   by the Location Recipient will contain the hostname of the LIS.  The
   Location Recipient MUST check the FQDN of the LIS in the reference
   with the identity presented in the server's certificate.  A
   discrepancy may indicate a possible man-in-the-middle-attack, and the
   Location Recipient should take appropriate action based on
   application dependent semantics.  Actions may include but are not
   limited to; proceeding anyway, flagging the result as suspect, or
   giving up.

   In some applications the Location Recipient has a pre-established
   relationship with one or several Location Information Servers and
   hence the LIS might authorize only certain Location Recipients might
   be allowed to resolve a reference.

Appendix A.  GEOPRIV Using Protocol Compliance

   This section compares the GEOPRIV requirements described in [8] with
   the approach outlined in this document.

   Req. 1.  (Location Object generalities):

   o  Regarding requirement 1.1, the Location Object has to be
      understood by the Location Recipient and the Location Server, the
      two communication end points.  The PIDF-LO [4] allows both civic
      and geospatial location information to be expressed.  Combining
      this with [6] ensures that location can be constructed and
      interpreted in a consistent manner.

   o  Regarding requirement 1.2, a number of fields in the civic
      location information format are optional.

   o  Regarding requirement 1.3, the civic location information is
      defined in an extensible way.

   o  Regarding requirement 1.4, the location information itself is not
      defined in this document.

   o  Regarding requirement 1.5, the protocol described in this document
      allows the Location Recipient to resolve a reference to a PIDF-LO
      only.

   o  Regarding requirement 1.6, the Location Object contains both
      location information and privacy rules.  Depending on the
      deployment scenario, which is outside the scope of this document,
      the privacy rules might have stronger or a weaker semantic.

   o  Regarding requirement 1.7, the Location Object is usable in a
      variety of protocols.

   o  Regarding requirement 1.8, no change regarding with respect to the
      encoding of the Location Object (see [4]) was made by this
      document.

   Req. 2.  (Location Object fields):

   o  Regarding requirement 2.1, depending on the deployment scenario an
      identifier pointing to the Target may be carried inside the
      PIDF-LO since the PIDF object provides the ability to carry this
      identifier.  In some circumstances it might be desirable not to
      carry information about the Target's identity in the PIDF-LO.

Internet-Draft        HTTPS Dereferencing Protocol             July 2008


   o  Regarding requirement 2.2, depending on the deployment scenario
      the LIS might require that the Location Recipient performs an
      authentication step.  The security mechanisms for client and
      server authentication are outside the scope of this document and
      defined already for HTTPS itself.

   o  Regarding requirement 2.3, proof of possession of the Location
      Recipient credentials is provided outside the scope of this
      document.  The security mechanisms defined for HTTPS are used by
      this document.

   o  Regarding requirement 2.5, RFC 4119 defines the basis for carrying
      location information in a PIDF document.  The ability to extend
      RFC 4119 to convey motion specific information is work in
      progress.

   o  Regarding requirement 2.6, this document as specified only allows
      the Location Recipient to resolve the reference and to indicate
      which location format has to be returned.

   o  Regarding requirement 2.7, the PIDF-LO relevant elements and
      attributes are available.

   o  Regarding requirement 2.8, provision exists for a reference to an
      external (more detailed rule set) within the PIDF-LO to be made.
      This is the <external-ruleset> element.

   o  Regarding requirement 2.9, security headers and trailers are
      provided Transport Layer Security.

   o  Regarding requirement 2.10, extensibility within the PIDF-LO is
      provided regarding the definition of namespaces.

   Req. 3.  (Location Data Types):

   o  Regarding requirement 3.1, [4] defines geospatial location
      information as the mandatory to implement location format. [6]
      describes in more detail the acceptable forms of geolocation and
      its interaction with civic notations.

   o  With the support of civic and geodedic location information in [4]
      the requirement 3.2 is fulfilled.

   o  Regarding requirement 3.3, rules described in [13] apply to an
      absolute geodetic point.  Geodetic information expressed in a
      PIDF-LO that complies with [6] may express an area or volume
      there-by "fuzzing" the location of the Target.

Internet-Draft        HTTPS Dereferencing Protocol             July 2008


   o  Regarding requirement 3.4, since the PIDF-LO format is designed to
      be extensible it allows further location information types to be
      defined in the future.


   Section 7.2 of [8] details the requirements of a "Using Protocol".
   These requirements are listed below:


   Req. 4.  The using protocol has to obey the privacy and security
            instructions coded in the Location Object regarding the
            transmission and storage of the LO.  This document carries
            the PIDF-LO as is via HTTPS from the LIS to the Location
            Recipient.  The sending and receiving parties must obey the
            instructions carried inside the object.

   Req. 5.  The using protocol will typically facilitate that the keys
            associated with the credentials are transported to the
            respective parties, that is, key establishment is the
            responsibility of the using protocol.  This document does
            not define additional security mechanisms beyond HTTPS.

   Req. 6.  (Single Message Transfer):  In particular, for tracking of
            small target devices, the design should allow a single
            message / packet transmission of location as a complete
            transaction.  The encoding of the RFC 4119-defined Location
            Object format is not changed.  Because of the verbose XML
            encoding it is not tailored towards inclusion into a single
            message.


   Section 7.3 of [8] details the requirements of a "Rule based Location
   Data Transfer".  These requirements are listed below:


   Req. 7.  (LS Rules):  Access to location information is controlled by
            allowing the Target (or by an entity on behalf of the
            Target) to indicate to which Location Recipients the short-
            lived location URI that contains a unguessable random
            component.  Additionally, constraints can be put on the
            dereferencing step by the Target.

   Req. 8.  (LG Rules):  In context of location URI it is not possible
            that there is no relationship between the Location Generator
            and the Location Information Server.  As such, the statement
            made in Requirement 7 applies.

Internet-Draft        HTTPS Dereferencing Protocol             July 2008


   Req. 9.  (Viewer Rules):  The Rule Maker might define (via mechanisms
            outside the scope of this document) which policy rules are
            disclosed to other entities.  These mechanisms are available
            with [13].  These rules are, however, best used when the
            location URI is not directly provided to Location Recipients
            but rather to an intermediary that stores these
            authorization policies, such as a location-based presence
            server.

   Req. 10.  (Full Rule language):  Geopriv has defined a rule language
             capable of expressing a wide range of privacy rules which
             is applicable in the area of the distribution of Location
             Objects.  The format of these rules are described in [12]
             and [13].  These rules may be used in a larger context but
             this document does not define their usage.

   Req. 11.  (Limited Rule language):  A limited (or basic) ruleset was
             introduced with PIDF-LO [4]).


   Section 7.4 of [8] details the requirements of "Location Object
   Privacy and Security".  These requirements are listed below:


   Req. 12.  (Identity Protection):  Identity protection of the Target
             can be provided if both the following conditions are true:

             (a)  the protocol used to convey the reference does not
                  disclose the identity of the Target and

             (b)  if the PIDF-LO does not contain information about the
                  identity about the Target.


             Currently, there is no mechanism available that allows the
             Target to tell the LIS which identity information to
             include in the PIDF-LO.

   Req. 13.  (Credential Requirements):  The security mechanism
             specified in this document is Transport Layer Security.
             TLS offers the ability to use different types of
             credentials, including symmetric, asymmetric credentials or
             a combination of them.

Internet-Draft        HTTPS Dereferencing Protocol             July 2008


   Req. 14.  (Security Features):  Geopriv defines a few security
             requirements for the protection of Location Objects such as
             mutual end-point authentication, data object integrity,
             data object confidentiality and replay protection.  The
             ability to use Transport Layer security fulfills these
             requirements.

   Req. 15.  Minimal Crypto:  The mandatory to implement ciphersuite is
             provided in the TLS layer security specification.

Appendix B.  HELD Compliance to IETF Location Reference Requirements

   This section describes how HELD complies to the location reference
   requirements stipulated in [7].

   High-level requirements for a location configuration protocol.

   C1.  "Location URI support - LCP: The configuration protocol MUST
        support a location reference in URI form."


        COMPLY.  HELD only provides location references in URI form.


   C2.  "Location URI expiration: The LCP MUST support the ability to
        specify to the server, the length of time that a location URI
        will be valid."


        COMPLY. basic HELD supports the LIS informing the Target of the
        location URI expiry time.  HELD context management extension
        [14] provides the Target the ability to specify exipry times for
        location URIs.


   C3.  "Location URI cancellation: The LCP MUST support the ability to
        request the cancellation of a specific location URI."


        COMPLY.  HELD context management extension [14] provides the
        Target the ability to void location URIs when required.


   C4.  "Random Generated: The location URI MUST be hard to guess, i.e.,
        it MUST contain a cryptographically random component."


        COMPLY.  The HELD specification provides specific guidance on
        the security surrounding location URI generation.


   C5.  "Identity Protection - LCP: The location URI MUST NOT contain
        any information that identifies the user, device or address of
        record within the URI form."


        COMPLY.  The HELD specification provides specific guidance on
        the anonymity of the Target with regards to the generation of

        location URIs.


   C6.  "Reuse flag default: The LCP MUST support the default condition
        of a requested location URI being repeatedly reused."


        COMPLY.  The default semantics of location URIs in HELD place no
        limits on the number of times that a location URI can be
        dereferenced.


   C7.  "One-time-use: The LCP MUST support the ability for the client
        to request a 'one-time-use' location URI (e.g., via a reuse flag
        setting)."


        COMPLY.  HELD context management extension [14] provides the
        Target the ability to set the number of times that a location
        URI may yield the Target's location.


   High-level requirements for a location dereference protocol.

   D1.  "Location URI support - LDP: The LDP MUST support a location
        reference in URI form."


        COMPLY.  HELD only provides location references in URI form.


   D2.  "Location URI expiration status: The LDP MUST support a message
        indicating that for a location URI which is no longer valid,
        that the location URI has expired."


        COMPLY.  HELD indicates to the requestor that location for the
        URI cannot be provided by returning a locationUnknown error when
        a location URI is found to have expired.


   D3.  "Authentication: The LDP MUST support either client-side and
        server-side authentication between client and server."


        COMPLY.  Client authentication may be provided using a variety
        of techniques.  However, this document does not mandate a
        specific procedure nor does it specify the format of

        authorization policies that may be in place to control access at
        the LIS.  The server authenticates itself using the methods
        described in HTTP on TLS [3].


   D4.  "Dereferenced Location Form: Location URI dereferencing MUST
        result in a well-formed PIDF-LO."


        COMPLY.  HELD when used as a dereference protocol MUST provide
        location information as a PIDF-LO that complies with [6] as
        described in Section 4.


   D5.  "Repeated use: The LDP MUST support the ability for the same
        location URI to be resolved more than once, based on server
        settings and LCP parameters."


        COMPLY.  A Location Recipient may access and use a location URI
        as many times as desired until such time as the URI expires due
        to age, or is made invalid by other Target policies on the LIS.


   D6.  "Updated location: The LDP MUST support the ability for the same
        location URI to be resolved into a continuum of location values
        (e.g., location updates)."


        COMPLY.  Using base-HELD the location of the Target is
        determined each time that URI is accessed.


   D7.  "Location form: The LDP MUST support dereferenced location in
        both coordinate and civic forms."


        COMPLY.  HELD provide the locationType parameter allowing the
        Location Recipient the ability to specify the form of location
        they require.
