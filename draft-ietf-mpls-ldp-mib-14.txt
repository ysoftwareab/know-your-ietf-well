INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


1.  Introduction

   This document defines 4 MIB Modules which together support the
   configuration and monitoring of the Label Distribution Protocol
   (LDP).  The Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) [RFC3036] is one type
   of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) protocols described in
   [RFC3031] and [RFC3032].  Utilizing all 4 MIB Modules allows an
   operator to configure LDP sessions using 3 different Layer 2 media.
   The Layer 2 media supported by the MIB Modules are Ethernet, ATM and
   Frame Relay as described in [RFC3036], [RFC3034] and [RFC3035].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


3.  Structure of the MIB Modules

   This section describes the structure of the LDP MIB Modules.


3.1.  Overview

   There are 4 MIB Modules in this document.  These MIB Modules are the
   MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB, the MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB, the MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-
   MIB and the MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB.  The MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB
   defines objects which are common to all LDP implementations.  The
   MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB defines Layer 2 Per Platform Label Space
   objects for use with the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.  The MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-MIB
   defines Layer 2 Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) objects for use with
   the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.  The MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB defines Layer
   2 FRAME-RELAY objects for use with the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.

   The MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB Module MUST be implemented and at least one of
   the Layer 2 MIB Modules MUST be implemented by an Agent developer on
   an Label Switching Router (LSR) or Label Edge Router (LER).  As an
   example, if an Label Switching Router (LSR) or Label Edge Router
   (LER) implementation intends to support LDP utilizing a Layer 2 of
   Ethernet, then the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB and the MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB
   Modules MUST implemented.  If an LSR/LER implementation intends to
   support LDP utilizing a Layer 2 of ATM, then the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB
   Module and the MPLS-LDP-ATM-MIB Module MUST be implemented.  If an
   LSR/LER implementation intends to support LDP utilizing a Layer 2 of
   FRAME-RELAY, then the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB Module and the MPLS-LDP-FRAME-
   RELAY-STD-MIB Module MUST be implemented.  An LDP implementation that
   utilizes all three Layer 2 media (Ethernet, Frame-Relay, ATM) MUST
   support all 4 MIB Modules.  Each of the Modules will be discussed in
   detail in the following sections.

   There are 2 compliance statements for each MIB Module.  One
   compliance statement is for full compliance which allows both
   configuration and monitoring via SNMP.  The other compliance
   statement is for read-only compliance which allows only monitoring
   via SNMP.


3.2.  Future Considerations

   The LDP Specification [RFC3036] does not specify the use of VPNs or
   multicast for LDP, and thus, objects related to these areas have not
   been included.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


   [RFC2684] does not describe VP merge capability and so this feature
   has not been included.

   These areas need to be specified in the LDP Specification or other
   specifications prior to being added in this or any other MIB
   document.


3.3.  Interface Indexing

   Interface Indexes as specified in [RFC2863] are used in these MIB
   Modules.  The descriptions of the ifIndexes denote which ifIndex is
   being used.  The use of ifIndex is for actual existing connections.


3.4.  Differences from the LDP Specification

   Currently, there are 3 differences between this specification and the
   LDP Specification.  As described in the Introduction, this document
   is almost entirely based on the LDP specification.  The differences
   are documented here.

   The first difference is that the LDP Entity Table contains some
   DEFVAL clauses which are not specified explicitly in the LDP
   Specification.  These values, although not documented in the LDP
   Specification, are widely used by existing LDP MIB implementations
   and thus, have been adopted within this MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB module.
   Please note, they can certainly be changed during row creation or a
   subsequent SET request.

   A second difference is the mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLRTable in the
   MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB Module.  This table, although provided as a
   way to reserve a range of generic labels, does not exist in the LDP
   Specification.  It was added to the MIB due to a request from the
   working group and because this table was considered useful for
   reserving a range of generic labels.

   The third difference is documented by the TEXTUAL-CONVENTION,
   MplsAtmVcIdentifier which is in the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB [MPLSTCMIB].
   This TC was added to restrict vci values to be greater than 31 as
   described in RFC 3035 [RFC3035].

3.5.  The MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB Module

   This MIB Module contains objects which are common to all LDP
   implementations.  This MIB Module MUST always be implemented along
   with one or more of the Layer 2 MIB Modules.

   This table allows the Label Edge Router (LER) or the Label Switching
   Router (LSR) to initiate and/or receive requests to establish LDP
   sessions.  As the LDP protocol distributes labels and establishes
   sessions with Peers most of the tables in this module are populated
   by the agent as instructed by the LDP protocol.  The exception is the
   mplsFecTable and the mplsLdpLspFecTable which can be configured by
   the operator to specify Forwarding Equivalence Class information for
   an LSP.

   Some scalars and each table in the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB Module is
   described in the following subsections.


3.5.1.  LDP Scalar Objects

   There are several scalar objects in the LDP MIB module.  The
   mplsLdpLsrId is a read-only scalar object which reports Lable
   Switching Router's (LSR's) Identifier.  This MUST be a globally
   unique value, such as the 32-bit router ID assigned to the LSR.

   The mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionCapable scalar object denotes whether the
   LSR is capable of supporting loop detection and if so, which form of
   loop detection.

   There are two LastChange scalar objects, mplsLdpEntityLastChange and
   mplsLdpPeerLastChange.  These objects give an indication of there was
   a change in the number of entries in the table, or if any of the
   values in the respective tables changed.  Please see the object's
   description for more details.

   The mplsLdpEntityIndexNext scalar object is described in the next
   section.


3.5.2.  The LDP Entity Table

   The MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB provides objects to configure/set-up potential
   LDP sessions on a specific LSR/LER.  The mplsLdpEntityTable is used
   to configure information which is used by the LDP protocol to setup
   potential LDP Sessions.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


   Each entry/row in this table represents a single LDP Entity.  There
   is no maximum number of LDP Entities specified.  However, there is an
   mplsLdpEntityIndexNext object which should be retrieved by the
   command generator prior to creating an LDP Entity.  If the
   mplsLdpEntityIndexNext object is zero, this indicates that the
   LSR/LER is not able to create another LDP Entity at that time.


3.5.2.1.  Changing Values After Session Establishment

   One way to manually modify a session's parameters is by using SNMP to
   change the MIB objects related to that session.  Please note, special
   care should be taken if MIB objects which are used in the MPLS LDP
   Session Initialization need to be modified.  If the modification of
   any of these MIB variables takes place anytime after the start of
   session intialization, then the entire session must be halted.  Any
   information learned by that session must be discarded.  The objects
   should then be modified, and session initialization started.
   Assuming that the configuration was done correctly, then a new
   session will be created.

   For example, assume that an operator wishes to change the
   configuration of a Label Range which is used by a Session that has
   already been established.  The operator should change the
   mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "disable(2)".  Setting the
   mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "disable(2)" will cause the session to be
   torn down (i.e. this will signal to LDP that it should send out tear
   down messages for that session).  Also, all information related to
   that session should be removed from this MIB by the Agent.  This
   includes Peer information (i.e. relevant row in the mplsPeerTable)
   and Session statistics (i.e. relevant row in the
   mplsLdpSessionTable).  Also, if the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB module [LSRMIB]
   is implemented and the optional Mapping Table objects are
   implemented, then all information related to the LSPs in this session
   should be removed from these MIB modules. [For more information
   please see the section on "The Mapping Tables".]  At this point, the
   operator could modify the Label Range.  Lastly, the operator should
   set the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus to "enable(1)".  At this point
   session initialization should occur.  The LDP Entity goes through the
   Session Initialization in order to communicate the new Label Ranges
   to the Peer and establish new LSPs.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


3.5.3.  The LDP Entity Statistics Table

   The mplsLpdEntityStatsTable is a read-only table which contains
   statistical information related to failed attempts to establish
   sessions.  Each row in this table AUGMENTS an mplsLdpEntityEntry.
   This table could be used to give insight into how to reconfigure
   values so that a session could be successfully established.  For
   example, if the mplsLdpEntityStatsSessionRejectedLRErrors Counter
   object was increasing, then this would indicate that the Label Range
   (LR) may need to be adjusted.


3.5.4.  The LDP Peer Table

   The mplsLdpPeerTable is a read-only table which contains information
   about LDP Peers known to LDP Entities.  In other words, the Peer
   information is learned by LDP through initialization or discovery.
   This table should be populated by the agent as directed by the LDP
   protocol.

   A row in this table is related to one or more rows in the Hello
   Adjacency Table and related to a single row in the Session Table.
   The values in the Peer table are specific to a Peer and may or may
   not be the same values used in the session.  The reason is that the
   Peer and Entity negotiate certain values.  The Entity's values are
   configured in the mplsLdpEntityTable and the Peer's values are
   learned (and placed into the mplsLdpPeerTable).  The
   mplsLdpSessionTable shows the values used in establishing the
   session.

   One example, of when the Peer's values and the Session's values may
   differ is with the Peer's Path Limit information.  The Peer's Path
   Limit information is learned from the session initialization phase.
   The actual value for the Path Vector Limit is the Peer's value and
   may not be the same value that appears in the session.  There could
   be a mismatch in this value between the Entity and the Peer. In the
   event of a mismatch, then the session will use the Path Limit set by
   the Entity (and not the Peer).

   The Peer Table information was placed in a separate table from the
   Session information to allow for a more comprehensive and coherent
   MIB model.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


3.5.5.  The LDP Session Table

   The LDP Session Table is a read-only table.  Each entry in this table
   represents a single session between an LDP Entity and a Peer. The
   mplsLdpSessionEntry AUGMENTS the mplsLdpPeerEntry.

   The information in this table is learned during session
   establishment.  NOTE: rows in this table will appear during session
   intialization.


3.5.6.  The LDP Session Statistics Table

   The mplsLdpSessionStatsTable is a read-only table which contains
   statistical information on sessions.  This table AUGMENTS the
   mplsLdpPeerTable.


3.5.7.  The LDP Hello Adjacency Table

   This is a table of all adjacencies between all LDP Entities and all
   LDP Peers.  A Session may have one or more adjacencies.  A session
   should not have zero adjacencies, because this indicates that the
   session has lost contact with the Peer.  A session which has zero
   Hello Adjacencies should be removed.


3.5.8.  The LDP LSP Table

   The Label Information Base (LIB) contains information about labels
   learned by the LSR.  The LIB for LDP, CR-LDP and MPLS-RSVP (i.e. all
   currently defined MPLS protocols) is represented in the LSR MIB
   [LSRMIB].  The LIB is represented by the LSR MIB's mplsXCTable (mpls
   Cross Connect Table), mplsInSegmentTable (mpls In Segment Table) and
   the mplsOutSegmentTable (mpls Out Segment Table).  The mplsXCTable
   models the cross-connection of the incoming label with a specific
   outgoing label.  The mplsInSegmentTable stores the incoming label's
   information, and the mplsOutSegmentTable stores the outgoing label's
   information.

   The LDP Session that created the LSP and the LSP's (incoming label,
   outgoing label) pair along with other information is contained in the
   MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB module's mplsXCTable, the mplsInSegmentTable and the
   mplsOutSegmentTable.

   In order to utilize the MPLS-LSR-STD-MIB module's mplsXCTable,

   mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable for LDP LSPs, there needs
   to be a mechanism to associate LDP sessions with LDP LSPs created as
   a result of those LDP sessions.  The mplsInSegmentLdpLspTable and
   mplsOutSegmentLdpLspTable in this MIB contain information to find the
   LDP LSP entries in the mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and
   the mplsXCTable.

   These two tables, the mplsInSegmentLdpLspTable and
   mplsOutSegmentLdpLspTable, have been made optional in the conformance
   section of the MIB.  They only need to be supported if the LSR MIBs
   mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and mplsXCTable are
   implemented.

   As discussed in the section, "Changing Values after Session
   Establishment", if a session is torn down, then all the information
   related to this session, must be removed from the both LDP MIB and,
   if implemented, from the LSR MIB.


3.5.9.  The FEC Table

   The FEC Table is a table which contains FEC (Forwarding Equivalence
   Class) information.  Each entry/row represents a single FEC Element.
   There is also an LDP LSP FEC Table, mplsLdpLspFecTable, which
   associates FECs with the LSPs.


3.5.10.  The LDP Session Peer Address Table

   The MPLS LDP Session Peer Address Table is a table which extends the
   mplsLdpSessionTable.  This table is a read-only table which stores
   Addresses learned after session initialization via Address Message
   advertisement.


3.6.  LDP Notifications

   Currently, there are several notifications which are specific for
   LDP.  These are described in this section.  There are no objects
   which enable or disable notifications from being generated.  RFC 3413
   [RFC3413] contains MIB modules which can be implemented that will
   enable or disable these notifications from being generated.

   The mplsLdpInitSessionThresholdExceeded notification indicates to the
   operator that there may be a misconfigured mplsLdpEntityEntry because
   the session associated with this Entity is not being established, and

   the Entity keeps trying to establish the session.  A side effect of
   this situation is that a row in the mplsLdpSessionTable may not be
   reaching the operational state as indicated by the
   mplsLdpSessionState object.  If the value of
   mplsLdpEntityInitSessionThreshold is 0 (zero) then this is equal to
   specifying the value of infinity for the threshold, and the
   mplsLdpInitSessionThresholdExceeded notification will never be sent.

   The mplsLdpPathVectorLimitMismatch notification is generated when
   there is a mismatch in the Path Vector Limits between the Entity and
   Peer during session initialization.  The session uses the value which
   is configured as the Entity's Path Vector Limit.  However, a
   notification should be generated to indicate that a mismatch
   occurred.  For further details, please see Section 3.5.3 of the LDP
   Specification [RFC3036].

   The mplsLdpSessionUp and mplsLdpSessionDown notifications are
   generated when there is an appropriate change in the
   mplsLdpSessionState object, e.g. when sessions change state (Up to
   Down for the mplsLdpSessionDown notification, or Down to Up for the
   mplsLdpSessionUp notification).  There was discussion about combining
   these two notifications into a single notification, however, some NMS
   applications can utilize two different notifications, rather than
   having to parse the varbind list of a single notification.  For
   example, the SessionDown is matched to a SessionUp notification more
   easily by some NMS applications, than having to parse a Varbind list
   in a SessionChange type of notification.


3.7.  LDP Notification Frequency

   LDP Notifications are expected to be few in number when LDP is
   ubiquitously deployed in a relatively stable network.  A notification
   receiver, e.g. an NMS, that receives these notifications should not
   be overwhelmed by the frequency of LDP notifications.  If this
   assertion proves to be inaccurate, then a throttling object to
   throttle these notifications may be added to future versions of the
   MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB.

4.1.  The MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-MIB Module

   This MIB Module MUST be supported if LDP uses ATM as the Layer 2
   medium.  There are three tables in this MIB Module.  Two tables are
   for configuring LDP to use ATM.  These tables are the
   mplsLdpEntityAtmTable and the mplsLdpEntityAtmLRTable.  The third
   table is the mplsLdpAtmSessionTable which is a read-only table.


4.1.1.  The LDP Entity ATM Table

   The mplsLdpEntityAtmTable provides a way to configure information
   which would be contained in the "Optional Parameter" portion of an
   LDP PDU Initialization Message.


4.1.2.  The LDP Entity ATM Label Range Table

   The mplsLdpEntityAtmLRTable provides a way to configure information
   which would be contained in the "ATM Label Range Components" portion
   of an LDP PDU Intialization Message, see  [RFC3035] and [RFC3036].


4.1.3.  The LDP ATM Session Table

   The MPLS LDP ATM Session Table is a read-only table which contains
   session information specific to ATM.

           The purpose of this table is to provide a mechanism

           with a contiguous range of vci's, or a 'label range'
           for LDP Entities.

           LDP Entities which use ATM must have at least one
           entry in this table.

           There must exist at least one entry in this
           table for every LDP Entity that has

           NOTE:  The ranges for a specific LDP Entity
           are UNIQUE and non-overlapping.  For example,
           for a specific LDP Entity index, there could
           be one entry having LowerBound vpi/vci == 0/32, and
           UpperBound vpi/vci == 0/100, and a second entry
           for this same interface with LowerBound
           vpi/vci == 0/101 and UpperBound vpi/vci == 0/200.
           However, there could not be a third entry with
           LowerBound vpi/vci == 0/200 and
           UpperBound vpi/vci == 0/300 because this label

4.2.  The MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB Module

   This MIB Module MUST be supported if LDP uses FRAME RELAY as the
   Layer 2 medium.  There are three tables in this MIB Module.  Two
   tables are to configure LDP for using Frame Relay.  These tables are
   the mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayTable and the
   mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayLRTable.  The third table,
   mplsLdpFrameRelaySessionTable, is a read-only table.


4.2.1.  The LDP Entity Frame Relay Table

   The mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the "Optional Parameter"
   portion of an LDP PDU Initialization Message.

4.2.2.  The LDP Entity Frame Relay Label Range Table

   The mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayLRTable provides a way to configure
   information which would be contained in the "Frame Relay Label Range
   Components" portion of an LDP PDU Intialization Message, see
   [RFC3034] and [RFC3036].


4.2.3.  The LDP Frame Relay Session Table

   The MPLS LDP Frame Relay Session Table is a read-only table which
   contains session information specific to Frame Relay.

4.3.  The MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB Module

   This MIB Module MUST be supported if LDP uses a Per Platform Label
   Space.  This MIB Module contains a Label Range (LR) table for
   configuring MPLS Generic Label Ranges.  This table is
   mplsLdpEntityGenericLRTable.  Although the LDP Specification does not
   provide a way for configuring Label Ranges for Generic Labels, the
   MIB does provide a way to reserve a range of generic labels because
   this was thought to be useful by the working group.

          However, if the InterfaceIndex is known,
          then it must be represented by this value.

          If an InterfaceIndex becomes known, then the
          network management entity (e.g. SNMP agent) responsible

5.  Revision History

   NOTE TO RFC-Editor:  before publishing this document as an RFC,
   please remove this Revision History (change log) section.


5.1.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-13.txt>

   Fix in the Full Compliance of the MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB module to remove
   MIN-ACCESS read-only from the mplsFecRowStatus and
   mplsLdpLspFecRowStatus objects.  The DESCRIPTION clauses were also
   updated accordingly.


5.2.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-12.txt>

   These fixes were from the MIB Doctor Review.

   - bottom of page6
     s/MPLS-TC-MIB/MPLS-TC-STD-MIB/

   - sect 3.6 first para
     change RFC2573 into RFC3413
     The citation [RFC2573] does not occur in the ref section either
     Neither doe RFC3413

   Fixed line lengths.


5.3.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-11.txt>

   Updated with comments from the 3rd Last Call for this MIB which took
   place, Thursday, June 12 to June 24, 2003.

   Updated with last call comments from Adrian Farrel posted to the MPLS
   Working Group email list on June 12, 2003.

   Updated the 2 outstanding issues from Bert's email May 9th which was
   posted to the MPLS Working Group.  These issues were not updated for
   version 10, so were addressed in version 11: 1) updated #3 from that
   email and 2) reviewed all the InetAddressType and InetAddress objects
   to make sure that descriptions were per rfc3291.

5.4.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-10.txt>

   Renamed the MIB module to include Std and also updated the IANA
   Considerations Section to use mplsStdMIB.

   Updated per Bert's email May 9th, with 2 exceptions: 1) did not yet
   update #3 from that email and 2) did not yet review all the
   InetAddressType and InetAddress objects to make sure that
   descriptions were per rfc3291.

   Changed Ses to Session for clarity.


5.5.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-09.txt>

   Added the new MIB boiler plate and associated MIB reference changes.

   Reworked the OID tree structure so that the Modules only have the
   mplsMIB subid dependency.  This was discussed in mpls wg email
   (discussion was mostly between Bert, Tom and Joan).

   Added IANA Considerations section.  This contains 4 subsections, one
   per MIB module.

   Updated and added new references as needed.

   Changed mplsMIB subid values to agree with the latest "Multiprotocol
   Label Switching (MPLS) Management Overview" document, [MPLSMGMT].

   Moved MIB modules around so that they would appear in subId order.
   The Generic MIB module is shown last, since the subid is 7 (which is
   the last (and largest) subid requested by IANA.



5.5.1.  Changes based on MIB Doctor Review Comments

   The following changes are based on comments from the MIB DR Review.
   The comments are from email to the mpls working group dated, Dec 6,
   2002.  These comments are quoted and prefaced by "REQ: comment goes
   here", and then followed by our resolution.

   "REQ: - missing IPR section".  RSP: it has been added.

   "REQ: - Security considerations probably needs more work
     Security ADs want you to explain what the vulnerabilities/risks

     are and what to do against them.
     Also for read only objects, pls list each (group of) object(s)
     and explain what sensitivity attributes they have".  RSP: Done. We
   added subsections here since the Security template is MIB Module
   based and it seemed to us more clear to do a subsection per MIB
   Module.

   "REQ: - pls do the consistency checking for descriptors and all
   that".  RSP: believe this to be done.  Changed Gen to Generic
   everywhere, changed Fr to FrameRelay, changed RO to ReadOnly.
   Changed Sessions to Ses everywhere.  Reviewed tables to make sure
   they were prefixed consistently.  Added more references, used more
   TCs and other stuff.

   "REQ: - sect 3.5 1st sentence, s/would be/are/ ??".  RSP: done.

   "REQ: - sect 3.5 2nd para first sentence  s/initiation/initiate/ ".
   RSP: done.

   "REQ: - section 3.5.2 s/mpsl/mpls/".  RSP: done.

   "REQ: - mplsXxxIndexNext
     See my comments on FTN MIB and LSR MIB on these type of objects
     Best to use something aka rfc3289 ".    RSP: We have imported the
   IndexInteger and IndexIntegerNextFree TCs (from rfc3289.txt).  NOTE:
   we do not like the names of these TCs because they use the term
   Integer when the values are Unsigned32.  Would prefer new TCs with
   IndexUnsigned32 and IndexUnsigned32NextFree.

   "REQ:- RowStatus and StorageType objects
     see my comments about similar objects in LSR MIB
     for StorageType might also want to add a DEFVAL ".    RSP: Added
   descriptive text to the RowStatus objects to specify which columns
   can be changed when row is active.  Added descriptive text to the
   StorageType objects to specify what happens when the StorageType is
   permanent.  Also added DEFVALs for the StorageType objects.

   "REQ: - mplsLdpNotifications ... { mplsLdpMib 2 }
     why not { mplsLdpMib 0} so that it is right away the prefix?
     I believe LSR MIB does it that way now. You may want to do
     it consistently for all notifications.
     I can live with either way, but prefer them to be shorter OIDs.".
   RSP: We changed this to follow what LSR MIB does (i.e.
   mplsLdpNotifications 0) for shorter OIDs..PP "REQ: -
   mplsXxxLastChange
     does that time stamp only get changed if an addition/deletion takes

     place? Not if something gets changed via a SNMP SET command?
     I think I'd prefer to also see changes (modifications) via SET.
     But in any event, be very explicit about if those are included or
     not.".    RSP:  All Last change object DESCRIPTIONs have been
   updated to be very specific.

   "REQ:- mplsLdpLspType
     All that stuff in the DESCRIPTION clause is just a repeat of the
     TC DESCRIPTION clause. Seems not needed to me. What if a value
     gets added later... how do you stay in sync?".    RSP: This has
   been fixed.

   "REQ: - mplsFecAddrLength
     Should that be of SYNTAX InetAddressPrefixLength as per RFC3291?".
   RSP: yes, fixed.

   "REQ: - mplsFecAddrFamily and mplsFecAddr
     These are strange. The DESCRIPTIONS are certainly not meeting the
     requirements as specified in RFC3291. At other places you do it
     correct, so you do understand what is required I think.". RSP:
   changed to have a better descriptions.  Should note that the TLVs in
   the LDP Specification use Address Family Numbers and are still
   referring to RFC1700.

   "REQ: - mplsLdpLspFecTable claims to be a read-only table.
     Yet you have a read-create RowStatus object in it.".    RSP: fixed.

   "REQ: - mplsLdpSessionUp and mplsLdpSessionDown
     Is it not better to just have one notification, namely a
     mplsLdpSessionStateChange and then the mplsLdpSesState object will
     explain what the change is?".    RSP:  We prefer to leave it this
   way. There are some 3rd Party applications that try to resolve
   Notifications, so you see one for down, then resolve this by seeing
   another one for up.  Granted, these 3rd party apps could be coded to
   parse the varbind within the trap, but then this requires coding
   whereas having 2 distinct notifications is easier on the developer.
   Granted, this maybe makes the MIB design more cumbersome.  If this is
   a blocking issue, then we will change it.

   "REQ:- COMPLIANCE section. I hope that INT ADs are OK with making
   IPv6
     addresses optional. Is that cause current LDP only supports IPv4?
     If so you may want to add that as an explanation.".    RSP: IPv6
   was made mandatory, also supported in MPLS LDP Spec (rfc3036.txt).

   Continue with MIB Dr Comments for the MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-MIB.

   "REQ:- same on mplsXXXIndexNext and RowStatus and STorageType
   objects".    RSP: These hdescriptions have been updated.  It should
   be noted, that these should be EXACTLY the same as the
   mplsLdpEntityTable since the Label Range Tables extend the Entity
   Table.  "REQ:- this looks wierd:

   IANA Considerations Section.  "REQ:- mplsGenModuleROCompliance

     it is good to be clear and consistent".    RSP: done.

   "REQ:- See earlier remark on Notifications (use zero instead of 2
   right away)".    RSP:Removed this branch because there aren't any
   notifications in this MIB module.

   "REQ:- There are still some INTEGER enumerations that start with zero
     It is not a BLOCKING problem... but if acceptable, pls make it
   start
     at 1 (as you have done vor various others of these enumerations)".
   RSP: We would rather leave these enums starting with zero. (There are
   2 of them in the ATM Module).  The reason for leaving them is because
   the value zero is what the protocol uses.  We have added REFERENCES
   to these objects and more info in the descriptions themselves.  We
   believe it is in the best interest of developers to start enums at
   zero.  The INET-ADDRESS-MIB uses the value zero, and since we are
   already required to use that MIB, there is precedence for zero in an
   enum where it makes sense.  We believe the value of zero makes sense
   for where it is being used in this MIB module.

   statement was added about this.  Also, used the DLCI TC from

5.6.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-08.txt>

   Changed "Label Switch Router" to "Label Switching Router".

   Spelling errors fixed (unlabelled, atttempt, subsytem).

   Changed some of the enums to start at 1, instead of zero:
   mplsLdpPeerLoopDetectionForPV and mplsLdpEntityOperStatus.

   Added REFERENCE clauses.

   Added a timestamp object for mplsLdpSesState changes.

   Changed NMS to command generator as defined in RFC2571.

   Added a lastChange objects: mplsLdpEntityLastChange and
   mplsLdpPeerLastChange.

   Added TEXTUAL-CONVENTIONS for MplsLabelDistributionMethod and
   MplsRetentionMode.  These TCs have been incorporated into draft-ietf-
   mpls-tc-mib-04.txt.

   Divided up the one MIB MODULE into 3 additional modules for a total
   of 4 MIB MODULES: 1) mplsLdpMIB, 2) mplsLdpGenericMIB which includes
   objects pertaining to Ethernet as the L2, 3) mplsLdpAtmMIB which
   includes objects pertaining to ATM as the L2, and 4)
   mplsLdpFrameRelayMIB which includes objects pertaining to Frame Relay
   as the L2.

   Also, reduced the number of objects by creating the mplsLdpLspTable
   and removing the Mapping tables.

   In section 3.1 changed "where each row in the table initiates" to
   "where each row in the table represents".

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


   Updated Reference Section and divided them into Normative vs.
   Informative.

   Removed the MplsGenAddress TC and used the INET-ADDRESS-MIB's
   InetAddress TC.  Objects using this TC are:
   mplsLdpEntityTargetPeerAddr, mplsFecAddr, and
   mplsLdpSesPeerNextHopAddr and are noted in the conformance statements
   supporting: unknown(0), ipv4(1), and ipv6(2).

   Removed AddressFamilyNumbers TC and used InetAddressType TC from the
   INET-ADDRESS-MIB.  One of the MIB compilers as a warning because
   apparently one is expected to use InetAddressType and InetAddress
   together (although, think this restriction is too restrictive). Also,
   removed the reference for the Address Family Numbers MIB.

   Changed the name TargPeer to TargetPeer.

   Removed the Enable/Disable trap objects:
   mplsLdpEntityPVLMisTrapEnable, and mplsLdpSesUpDownTrapEnable.  RFC
   3413 should be used to enable/disable traps.

   Removed the import for "transmission" and instead, imported "mplsMIB
   from the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB".

   Changed mplsLdpEntityPVL to mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit and updated
   the DESCRIPTION clause.  Also, the PVL abbreviation was expanded to
   PathVectorLimit for other objects.

   Combined the objects: mplsLdpPeerLoopDectionForPV and mplsLdpPeerPVL
   into one object: mplsLdpPeerPathVectorLimit and updated the
   DESCRIPTION clause.

   mplsLdpEntityTcpDscPort uses InetPortNumber TC from the INET-ADDRESS-
   MIB.  Likewise, mplsLdpEntityUdpDscPort uses the InetPortNumber TC
   from the INET-ADDRESS-MIB.  Also a REFERENCE clause was added.

   The mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength object has the SYNTAX range changed to
   start at 256.  Also the DESCRIPTION clause was updated.

   The mplsLdpSesMaxPduLen object's name was changed to
   mplsLdpSesMaxPduLength and a UNITS clause was added, and the
   DESCRIPTION clause was updated.  This object is related to the
   mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength object.

   The mplsLdpEntityKeepAliveHoldTimer and mplsLdpEntityHelloHoldTimer
   DESCRIPTION clause was changed from "The two octet value" to "The

   The mplsLdpEntityHelloHoldTimer object's DESCRIPTION clause was
   updated.

   A range of Integer32(0..100) was added to the SYNTAX clause of the
   mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold object.  Also, the DESCRIPTION clause
   of this object was updated.

   The mplsLdpEntityOptionalParameters object was renamed to
   mplsLdpEntityLabelType.

   Updated the mplsLdpEntityAdminStatus and mplsLdpEntityRowStatus
   objects.  RowStatus now reflects the status of the row, and Admin
   status controls enabling/disabling the entry.

   Updated the DESCRIPTION clauses for the objects in the
   mplsLdpEntityStatsTable to refer to the
   mplsLdpEntityDiscontinuityTime object.

   Changed StorType to StorageType.


5.7.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-07.txt>

   There were three types of changes:  the first change was that all the
   MPLS Textual Conventions from this MIB, the LSR and MPLS-TE MIBs were
   moved into a new document [MPLSTCMIB], "draft-ietf-mpls-tc-
   mib-00.txt".  The Textual Conventions are now IMPORTED from
   [MPLSTCMIB].  The second type of change was updates based on comments
   from the IESG.  These changes will be discussed below.  The third
   type of changes were based on minor editorial changes from the co-
   authors.

   The "Introduction" and "Structure of the MIB" sections were reworded
   since they were repetitive.

   The "Overview" was rearranged.

   References were added to "The LDP Entity ATM Objects" and "The LDP
   Entity Frame Relay Objects" Sections.

   The Working Group mailing list and Chairs were added to the CONTACT-
   INFO.

   Updated the DESCRIPTION clause for the "mplsLdpEntityLdpId" object.

   Updated the mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion to include a range
   (1..65535).

   Updated the "References" Section.

   Running the MIB through the smilint MIB compiler showed that some
   object names were longer than 32 characters, these were shortened to
   32 characters or fewer.

   The following changes were from the co-authors.

   Other minor editorial changes such as fixing typographical errors,
   and removing MIB comments which are no longer meaningful.

   Page 17 (also page 46) the description was enhanced to describe the
   version field in the LDP header from RFC3036.

   Removed WellKnown from the tcp and upd port names.  It's the ports
   that get set, and the default value is the well known (actually the
   registered) port number.

   mplsLdpEntityInitSesTrapEnable object is useless and was removed
   since setting mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold=0 acheives the same
   thing.  Also removed it from the descriptive text in section 3.

   Page 47, mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime The initial value of this
   was changed to be sysUpTime instead of zero.  sysUpTime for when the
   session starts is more meaningful and was added to the Session
   Up/Down Traps also.  Also, added the Session specific stats to the
   up/down traps.


5.8.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-06.txt>

   All changes were from the second last call which took place Thursday,
   July 20th, until Thursday, July 27th, 2000 and are described in the
   remainder of this section.

   Remove the reference to the MPLS framework document.

   Add an mplsFecIndexNext type of object.

   Change the conformance of the FEC table objects to be part of the
   mplsLdpGeneralGroup.

   The mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable is no longer needed because the

   functionality has been absorbed by the
   mplsLdpEntityConfGenericLabelRangeTable.  The
   mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable has been removed and the front section
   was updated accordingly.

   Other editorial issues, updating references, typos and so forth.


5.9.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-05.txt>

   The majority of changes in this revision are based on Last Call
   comments which were received during the last call from Thursday,
   March 9, 2000 to Friday, March 17, 2000, or slightly thereafter.
   Also, changes were made to agree with the latest specifications.
   These changes are described in this section.

   Changes due to draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-07.txt and draft-ietf-mpls-
   ldp-08.txt. Specifically, removing references to IPv4/IP and using
   router id, as appropriate.

   Removed vpMerge and vpAndVcMerge choices from the object,
   mplsLdpEntityAtmMergeCap.  VP Merge is not described in [RFC3036].

   The LIB Table was removed and replaced by mapping tables to map LDP
   LSPs created by LDP sessions to the mplsInSegment, mplsOutSegment and
   mplsXC  tables in the LSR MIB.  The conformance section was updated
   to include a Mapping Group which is to be implemented iff these LSR
   MIB tables (mplsInSegmentTable, mplsOutSegmentTable and mplsXCTable)
   are implemented.

   The front section was updated to include information on the Generic
   label table.

   Added more in the front section on on Row
   Creation/adminStatus/OperStatus in the LDP Entity and related tables.

   Added a generic label range table. NOTE: there is NO corresponding
   LDP message which relates to the information in this table, however,
   this table does provide a way for a user to 'reserve' a generic label
   range.

   A new TEXTUAL-CONVENTION, MplsAtmVcIdentifier was added.  This TC has
   the same upper bounds as AtmVcIdentifier (from rfc2514) except that
   the lower bound is 32 (and not 0).  The lower bound is 32 since this
   value is specified by [RFC3035].

   Removed the scalar object mplsLsrLabelRetentionMode and added
   mplsLdpEntityLabelRetentionMode.  The change was made to allow
   configuring the retention mode on a per LDP Entity basis, as opposed
   for the entire LSR.

   Typo in section 3.5.2 was fixed.

   Typo in the mplsLdpSessionUp notification description was fixed.

   Section 'LDP Notifications' was expanded to cover both the
   'mplsLdpSessionUp' and 'mplsLdpSessionDown' traps.  Also, the objects
   which enable and disable these traps have been described in this
   Section:

   The 'mplsLdpEntityHopCountLoopDetection' object and the
   'mplsLdpEntityHopCount' object have been combined into the new
   object, 'mplsLdpEntityHopCountLimit'.

   MplsLabel has been updated to reflect the VPI value of 12 bits and
   not 8.

   Added DEFVAL clause to the 'mplsLdpEntityWellKnownDiscoveryPort'
   object.  The default value is 646.

   Added UNITS and DEFVAL clauses to the 'mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength'
   object.  The default value is 4096 and the units is octets.

   Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityProtocolVersion' object.  The
   default value is 1.

    Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityKeepAliveHoldTimer' of 40
   seconds.

   Added DEFVAL clause to 'mplsLdpEntityInitSesThreshold' object.  The
   default value is 8.

   The mplsLdpEntityWellKnownDiscoveryPort was changed into two objects,
   one for TCP and one for UDP.  The names are

5.10.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-04.txt>

   Editorial changes, fixing typo's, fixing wrapping lines, etc.

   Updated references for latest drafts, and added [RFC3032] and
   [RFC3034] to Reference Section.

   Added to the Acknowledgements Section.

   Changed the SYNTAX and DESCRIPTION of the
   'mplsLdpLsrLoopDetectionCapable' object, so that it will also support
   the loop detection by hop count.

   Combined the 'mplsLdpEntityLoopDetectionForPV' and 'mplsLdpEntityPVL'
   objects.  The functionality of the 'mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV' is
   now denoted by the value of 0 (zero) in the 'mplsLdpEntityPVL'
   object.  This results in one less object
   'mplsLdpEntityLoopDectionForPV' but does not sacrifice functionality.

   Changed 'mplsLdpLibLabelType' into two objects:
   'mplsLdpLibInLabelType' and differ from the egress label type.  The
   MIB now reflects this.

   The following items were changed as a result of the Frame Relay Forum
   dropping support for 17-bit DLCIs:  the MplsLabel TC description has
   been modified, and other Frame Relay Object descriptions were also
   modified (as specified in this section).

   The MplsLabel TC was also modified and reference 3. was added to the
   REFERENCE Clause.

   MplsLdpLabelTypes TC was modified to use an enum.

   InterfaceIndex support was added to the Entity information.  This was
   specifically requested by several members of the working group.  An
   additional table, mplsLdpEntityConfGenericTable as a way to configure
   Generic Labels, and an object, 'mplsLdpConfGenericIfIndexOrZero was
   added to map the InterfaceIndex used by Generic Labels.  Objects were
   also added to the 'mplsLdpEntityAtmParmsTable' and the and
   'mplsLdpEntityFrIfIndex', respectively.

   Changed the name of the 'mplsLdpEntityMtu' object to be
   'mplsLdpEntityMaxPduLength' which is more consistent with the LDP
   Specification.  Also, the description and SYNTAX were changed.

   Changed the SYNTAX of the 'mplsLdpSessionMaxPduLength' to unsigned32

   Added and improved the front section discussion on SNMP
   Notifications.

   Also, modified the DESCRIPTION clause of the

   Added objects to enable/disable the sending of traps:

   Added an object to enable/disable sending traps for Sessions changing
   from Up to Down, or Down to Up.

   Added notifications to generate traps from session changing from Up
   to Down, or Down to up.

   Added a StorageType object to the Entity and associated tables which
   are configurable.

   Added a Discontinuity Time object to the Entity Table,

   Added discussion on row creation in the Entity and other associated
   Entity tables.  This is a new Section in the Front part of the
   document called:

   Removed the 'mplsLdpEntityControlMethod'.

   Made 'mplsLdpFecLspId' as part of the INDEX for the FEC table.  This
   is to allow FECs to map to multiple LSPs.  Also add a RowPointer to a
   row in the Session Table.

   Added an operation status object, 'mplsLdpLspOperStatus' and a last
   Change object, 'mplsLdpLspLastChangeto the LIB Table.  This will be
   used to detect whether an LSP has changed its status.

   Changed the name of the mplsLdpPeerTable to the
   mplsLdpEntityPeerTable.  This table contains information relevant to
   Peers which are known to specific Entities.  The indexing of this
   table has also changed to include the Row in the Entity Table that
   this Peer is known by.  The mplsLdpHelloAdjacencyTable and the
   mplsLdpSessionTable have been moved under this table.  Since Hello
   Adjacencies are related to Entity-Peer information and Sessions are
   related to Entity-Peer information this was seen as a comprehensive
   and coherent modelling.  Associated descriptions in the front section
   and in the tables have been changed to reflect this change.

   Moved the 'mplsLdpConfFrLen' object from the

   'mplsLdpEntityConfFrLabelRangeTable' to the
   'mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable' since the Frame Relay
   interface/port can only use one header length at a time, i.e. a
   specific FR interface supports one address length for all VCs on that
   interface.  Also, changed the object so that it only supports 10 and
   23 bit DLCI lengths. (The 17 bit length was dropped by the Frame
   Relay Forum and thus, is no longer required.)  The name of this
   object was changed from 'mplsLdpConfFrLen' to 'mplsLdpEntityFrLen' to
   fit in with the 'mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayParmsTable'.

   Removed the seventeenDlciBits(1) value from the mplsLdpFrSessionLen
   object.  (The 17 bit length was dropped by the Frame Relay Forum and
   thus, is no longer required.)

   Corrected the range of the 'mplsLdpEntityIndexNext' object to include
   0 (zero).


5.11.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-03.txt>

   Reworded the description of the mplsLdpAtmSessionTable to clarify
   that one or MORE label range intersection(s) is/are represented in
   this table.

   Reworded the description of the mplsLdpFrameRelaySessionTable to
   clarify that one or MORE label range intersection(s) is/are
   represented in this table.

   Added a new index, mplsLdpSessionPeerIndex, to the
   mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable.  This new index uniquely identifies
   the entry within a given session.  (Since  adding
   mplsLdpSessionPeerNextHopAddressType,
   mplsLdpSessionPeerNextHopAddress to the INDEX clause of the
   mplsLdpSessionPeerAddressTable leaves a table with only indices and
   no objects, the work around was to add a new index which uniquely
   differentiates an entry within a given session.)

   Quite a few changes to the mplsLdpPeerTable.  First, removed the
   mplsLdpPeerIndex from the mplsLdpPeerTable and other tables.  This
   index served no purpose, so was removed.  Second, removed the
   objects: mplsLdpPeerInternetworkAddrType, and
   mplsLdpPeerInternetworkAddr.  Third, reworded the description of this
   table to include information which is known during Session
   Intialization attempts, the specific information has to do with Loop
   Dection based on Path Vectors.  Since Section 3.5.3 of the LDP Spec
   when describing the PVLim says: "Although knowledge of a peer's path

   Updated the boiler.me from the ops web page dated Weds., Dec 22,
   1999.

   Updated the Security Section from the ops web page.

   Added the following objects to the mplsLdpEntityTable:

   mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit.

   Removed mplsLdpSessionLabelAdvertisement,
   mplsLdpSessionLoopDetectionForPV, and mplsLdpSessionPathVectorLimit
   from the mplsLdpSessionTable.

   Changed the mplsLdpPathVectorLimitMismatch Notification to send
   mplsLdpEntityPathVectorLimit (instead of
   mplsLdpSessionPathVectorLimit).

   Copied the MplsLabel TC from draft-ietf-mpls-lsr-mib-00.txt and
   replaced the MplsLdpGenAddr for mplsLdpLibInLabel and
   mplsLdpLibOutLabel with MplsLabel.

   The mplsLdpSessionIndex was removed throughout the MIB.  This was
   replaced by the object mplsLdpSessionDiscontinuityTime.  The
   motivation was to reduce the number of indices.

   The descriptions for the objects in the mplsLdpSessionStatsTable,
   mplsLdpSessionStatsUnknownMessageTypeErrors and

5.13.  Changes from <draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-mib-01.txt>

   The MIB was updated to correspond to draft-ietf-mpls-ldp-06.txt of
   the LDP Specification [RFC3036].

   The front section was updated.

   The MIB was made to be less ATM-centric.  Essentially, the ATM
   specific objects where removed from the tables and placed in ATM
   specific Tables.  A type was added to the base tables and a row is to
   be created in the ATM/FR/etc.  type table.  Apropos compliance
   statements were added to reflect the separation of ATM and Frame
   Relay objects into their respective tables.

   Objects for Loop Detection were removed from describing the LDP
   implementation (i.e. the scalars were removed) and Loop Dection
   objects were added to the Session Table.  (Although as the LDP
   Specification indicates loop detection should be for an LSR within a
   domain.)

   LSR Ids and does not need to be explicitly in the MIB.)  ATM specific
   objects (mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeLowerBoundVpi
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeLowerBoundVci,
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeUpperBoundVpi
   mplsLdpSessionAtmLabelRangeUpperBoundVci) were removed and put into a

   Hello Adjacency Table was updated.

   The objects, mplsLdpSessionRejectedParamErrors,
   mplsLdpSessionRejectedNoHelloErrors, mplsLdpBadLdpIdentifierErrors,
   mplsLdpBadPduLengthErrors, mplsLdpBadMessageLengthErrors,
   mplsLdpBadTlvLengthErrors, mplsLdpMalformedTlvValueErrors,
   mplsLdpKeepAliveTimerExpiredErrors, mplsLdpShutdownNotifReceived, and
   mplsLdpShutdownNotifSent were added to the mplsLdpEntityStatsTable.

   The mplsLdpSessionStatsTable was added to count statics based on a
   per Session basis.

   The mplLdpPeerConfAtmLabelRangeTable has been removed.  There is no
   need to configure information for a Peer.  All information for a peer
   is learned, thus peer information is read-only.

   (Editorial) References were updated to reflect the documents which

9.  Security Considerations

   This Security Considerations section consists of 4 subsections, one
   for each of the MIB Modules in this document.


9.1.  Security Considerations for MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityTable contains objects to provision potential
        LDP sessions on the Label Switching Router (LSR) or Label Edge
        Router (LER).   The mplsLdpLspFecTable contains objects which
        associate an LSP with a FEC.  Unauthorized access to objects in
        these tables, could result in disruption of traffic on the
        network.  This is especially true if an LDP session has been
        established.  The use of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3
        security should be considered where possible.  Specifically,
        SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with any v3 agent which
        implements this MIB.  Administrators should consider whether
        read access to these objects should be allowed, since read
        access may be undesirable under certain circumstances.

INTERNET-DRAFT                MPLS LDP MIB                 November 2003


   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module i.e., "objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible", may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityTable, mplsLdpPeerTable, mplsLdpSesTable and
        mplsLdpSesStatsTable collectively show the LDP LSP network
        topology.  If an Administrator does not want to reveal the LDP
        LSP topology of the network, then these tables should be
        considered sensitive/vulnerable.


9.2.  Security Considerations for MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-MIB

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityAtmTable and mplsLdpEntityAtmLRTable contain
        objects to provision potential LDP sessions on the Label
        Switching Router (LSR) or Label Edge Router (LER) over Layer 2
        of ATM.  These tables extend the mplsLdpEntityTable in the MPLS-
        LDP-MIB.  Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could
        result in disruption of traffic on the network.  This is
        especially true if an LDP session has been established.  The use
        of stronger mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be
        considered where possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM
        MUST be used with any v3 agent which implements this MIB.
        Administrators should consider whether read access to these
        objects should be allowed, since read access may be undesirable
        under certain circumstances.

   o    the mplsLdpEntityAtmTable and mplsLdpEntityAtmLRTable show the
        Label Ranges for ATM.  If an Administrator does not want to
        reveal this information then these tables should be considered
        sensitive/vulnerable and treated accordingly.



9.3.  Security Considerations for MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayTable and
        mplsLdpEntityFrameRelayLRTable contain objects to provision
        potential LDP sessions on the Label Switching Router (LSR) or
        Label Edge Router (LER) over Layer 2 of Frame Relay.  These
        tables extend the mplsLdpEntityTable in the MPLS-LDP-MIB.
        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result in
        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true
        if an LDP session has been established.  The use of stronger
        mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where
        possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with

9.4.  Security Considerations for MPLS-LDP-GENERIC-STD-MIB

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o    the mplsLdpEntityGenericLRTable contains objects to provision
        potential LDP sessions on the Label Switching Router (LSR) or
        Label Edge Router (LER) over Layer 2 of Ethernet.  This table
        extends the mplsLdpEntityTable in the MPLS-LDP-MIB.
        Unauthorized access to objects in these tables, could result in
        disruption of traffic on the network.  This is especially true
        if an LDP session has been established.  The use of stronger
        mechanisms such as SNMPv3 security should be considered where
        possible.  Specifically, SNMPv3 VACM and USM MUST be used with
        any v3 agent which implements this MIB.  Administrators should
        consider whether read access to these objects should be allowed,
        since read access may be undesirable under certain
        circumstances.

        ethernet.  If an Administrator does not want to reveal this
        information then these tables should be considered
        sensitive/vulnerable and treated accordingly.


9.5.  Additional Security Considerations

   The following paragraphs describe additional security considerations
   which are applicable to all 4 of the MIB Modules in this document.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure "for example by using IPSec",
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is

   allowed to access and GET/SET "read/change/create/delete" the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework "see [RFC3410], section 8",
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms "for
   authentication and privacy".

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED. Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module, is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals "users" that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET "change/create/delete" them.



10.  IANA Considerations

   As described in [MPLSMGMT] and as requested in the MPLS-TC-STD-MIB
   [MPLSTCMIB], MPLS related standards track MIB modules should be
   rooted under the mplsStdMIB subtree.  There are 4 MPLS MIB Modules
   contained in this document, each of the following "IANA
   Considerations" subsections requests IANA for a new assignment under
   the mplsStdMIB subtree.  New assignments can only be made via a
   Standards Action as specified in [RFC2434].


10.1.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LDP-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB 4 } to the MPLS-LDP-STD-
   MIB module specified in this document.


10.2.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LDP-ATM-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB 5 } to the MPLS-LDP-ATM-
   STD-MIB module specified in this document.


10.3.  IANA Considerations for MPLS-LDP-FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB

   The IANA is requested to assign { mplsStdMIB 6 } to the MPLS-LDP-
   FRAME-RELAY-STD-MIB module specified in this document.
