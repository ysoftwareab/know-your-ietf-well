   Inter-FE topology discovery: Topology discovery relates to how the 
   FEs are interconnected with each other with respect to packet 
   forwarding. This is the complete view of the intra-NE network as 
   seen by the CE. 
 
  Inter-FE topology maintenance: Once the inter-FE topology has been 
  discovered, it has to be continuously monitored to ensure that any 
  changes to the topology are reported to the corresponding CE. This 
  represents the steady state and final phase of the protocol.

Internet Draft             ForCES Discovery                  July 2004 
 
   The ForCES framework document [RFC 3746] describes how a set of 
   control elements (CEs) and forwarding elements (FEs) interact with 
   each other to form a single network element (NE). It describes the 
   ForCES  post-association  phase  protocol  working  across  the  Fp 
   reference point between CE and FE. This document describes an 
   important aspect of the ForCES operational infrastructure, that of 
   discovering the layout of the different elements within an NE. 
    
   We  describe  a  mechanism  for  obtaining  the  Intra-NE/Inter-FE 
   topology. 
   The mechanism is divided into two distinct operational pieces: 
   . The FE side component that collects FE neighbor information. 
   . The CE side component that uses the neighbor information to 
     compute the NE topology. 
   Given the above split, we believe that this mechanism fits well 
   within a description of Topology Discovery LFB. 
    
    
    The mechanism at the FE can be divided into two modes or phases. 
    
   . Phase I corresponds to the actual discovery process wherein each 
     element  discovers  its  neighbor  and  maintains  a  neighbor 
     relationship. Upon Joining an NE, the CE will instruct the FE to 
     start collecting this information. This happens when the FE is 
     administratively up and the associated neighbor links are deemed 
     to be provisioned and operationally up. 
   . Phase II corresponds to the topology maintenance phase, wherein 
     any changes to the inter-FE topology during normal operation is 
     reported to the corresponding CE so that an updated view is 
     available. The CE then makes all services it is controlling aware 
     of such details. As an example, based on policy, in a basic IPV4 
     service, the tables of associated FEs will need to be updated. 
    
   As noted above, both phases occur during the post-association phases 
   of  the  ForCES  protocol.  In  other  words,  the  ForCES  protocol 
   association between the CE and the FEs should already have taken 
   place for the discovery mechanism to kick in. This is required 
   because  the  neighbor  relationships  maintained  by  the  FEs  are 
   reported back to the CE (or queried by the CE) over the ForCES 
   protocol. 
    
   The proposed discovery mechanism is required to scale to a very 
   large number of forwarding elements in the NE, with minimal impact 
   on the resources. The following list provides some of the features 
   and goals of the discovery mechanism. 
    
   . Determine connectivity between elements 
   . React to changes in link connectivity

   . Construct topology information from the collected partial topology 
     information 
   . Tolerant to protocol message losses 
   . Applicable to all inter-FE network topologies such as ring, mesh, 
     star etc. 
   . Cause minimal overhead 
   . Agnostic of the network interconnect technology 
    
 
2.1. Motivation 
    
   The ForCES architecture defines a network element (NE) as a single 
   managed entity made up of a collection of FEs and CEs and is 
   indistinguishable from other network elements in the network. This 
   NE model definition leads to three types of links from the networkÆs 
   perspective: internal (or intra-NE) links and external (or inter-NE) 
   links and control links. Intra-NE links are purely internal to the 
   NE and are not exposed to the external world; whereas, inter-NE (or 
   external) links are exposed to the external world and over which 
   routing adjacencies (such as OSPF, IS-IS, BGP etc.) can be formed. 
   An NE can contain FEs that have zero or more internal/external links 
   ¡ e.g. in Fig. 1, FE3 has two internal links and no external links 
   while FE1 and FE2 have two internal links and one external link 
   each. Control links are those links that are used for communication 
   between the CE and FE. If the CE and FE are a single Layer 3 hop 
   away as in Fig.1, the control link is typically a physical link e.g. 
   link A of FE1 in the figure. Control links can be logical as well. 
 
   A packet entering a ForCES NE may travel multiple FEs within the NE 
   before it exits onto the output link. This requires that the packet 
   be correctly forwarded from the ingress FE to the egress FE. This 
   internal forwarding requires knowledge of the physical FE inter-
   connection topology so that the CE can appropriately setup internal 
   LFB tables at each FE to handle packet traversal in a sane manner. 
   We use a simple topology discovery mechanism that only operates on 
   internal links and provides the necessary routing information to 
   forward the packets from the ingress FE to the egress FE. Further, 
   the  mechanism  should  be  able  to  reroute  around  internal  link 
   failures, if a path exists. This makes the NE highly available and 
   resilient.

3. Topology Discovery Mechanism 
 
   The topology discovery mechanism described here will be restricted 
   to the case where the control and the forwarding elements are a 
   single layer 3 hop away. However, there is no restriction on the 
   number of layer 2 hops between the CE and the FEs. Although, the 
   mechanism  can  be  extended  to  the  multi-hop  scenario,  it  is 
   considered beyond the scope of this document to describe it. The 
   mechanism is expected to work on point-to-point as well as multi-
   access links.  
    
   In order to keep the discovery and maintenance mechanism as simple  
   as possible, the FEs only maintain relationships with the respective 
   neighbors to determine the status of the neighbors. No databases are 
   exchanged between the neighbors. This implies that the topology view 
   for each FE is only limited to the adjacent elements. This partial 
   topology information is reported back to the CE (or queried by the 
   CE) over the ForCES protocol. Since the CE receives such information 
   from all the FEs, it can easily construct the full topology from 
   individual partial topologies reported by each FE. Once the CE 
   constructs the full topology, such information can be passed to the 
   FEs, if needed (depending on policy). 
    
Ansari et al.             Expires: Jan 2005                  [Page 5] 
Internet Draft             ForCES Discovery                  July 2004 
   Topology information is needed by a lot of LFBs and associated 
   services that span multiple FEs within a NE. In the case where the 
   FE aids the CE in offloading the table updates, then it makes sense 
   for the FE to be topology aware. It is sometimes also helpful to 
   keep full topology information at the FEs for cases such as ômessage 
   snoopingö optimizations. For example, if an FE is aware of the 
   topology, it could snoop on messages sent to other FEs (e.g. 
   broadcasts,  multicasts)  and  update  its  own  tables  dynamically 
   without involving the CE. Another example would be FE-FE primary-
   backup handover scenario. With each FE being fully aware of the 
   complete topology, the backup FE can take over the responsibilities 
   of the primary without involving the CE for such a handover. 
 
3.1. Minimum requirements  
    
   In order for the protocol to work as described, the following 
   assumptions are made. 
     . Each element has been configured with their respective IDs 
        (CEID, FEID) 
     . Element bindings process has already taken place. In other 
        words, the CE know all the FEs it wants to control and each FE 
        knows which CE is allowed to control it. 
     . The ForCES protocol association has already taken place between 
        the CE and the FE in question. 
     . The protocol is enabled on the required interfaces. 
    
   Note that these are configuration requirements and are satisfied by 
   the respective managers (CEM/FEM). 
      
3.2. Protocol Details 
    
   Once the ForCES protocol association has been established between a 
   CE and a given FE ¡ i.e. it is in post-association phase, the CE 
   starts  sending/advertising  Hello/Probe  messages  to  the  FEÆs 
   neighbors such that the messages go through the given FE. In other 
   words, it looks like the given FE is generating probe messages to 
   the neighbor (except that these messages are coming from the CE over 
   the  ForCES  protocol  first).  However,  this  functionality  of 
   generating probe messages by the CE can be offloaded to the FE 
   itself (to be more precise, to an FE LFB) ¡ so that the FE can 
   originate and terminate the probe messages. This provides better 
   scalability of the CE and itÆs resources. The CE can now simply 
   query each FEÆs neighbor relationship database and register for any 
   events related to topology changes. 
    
   All Hello/Probe messages travel a single PE hop and are not routed 
   to other elements beyond the first hop. This is ensured by using a 
   TTL of one on all Hello/Probe packets. The messages are sent as IP 
   datagrams  (multicast/broadcast,  where  applicable,  or  unicast  in 
Ansari et al.             Expires: Jan 2005                  [Page 6] 
Internet Draft             ForCES Discovery                  July 2004 
   general) to the neighboring elements over configured interfaces. 
   Each FE topology LFB component maintains the neighbor relationships 
   as long as the Hello messages are received from the neighbor. If it 
   does not receive a pre-determined number (configured) of back-to-
   back Hello messages from a given neighbor, it deletes the entry from 
   the database and reports this change to the CE in the form of an 
   event-driven message over the ForCES protocol. This ensures that the 
   CE has the complete and up-to-date information of the underlying 
   topology of the Inter-FE network. 
 
   The Hello message contains information necessary for discovering and 
   maintaining neighbor relationships. It contains the PE ID, type of 
   protocol element (i.e. CE or FE), interval between any two messages, 
   interval for deeming a neighbor inactive, capability information 
   etc. This is, in some ways, similar to the capabilities of the OSPF 
   Hello protocol. 
    
   On receiving the Hello messages from a neighbor, the FE responds 
   back with its own Hello message in a packet format similar to the 
   one  received  from  the  neighbor.  Essentially,  both  sides  are 
   independently sending Hello messages to each other and listing their 
   neighbor table. Also, each neighbor will see itself listed on its 
   neighbors Hello message. This ensures bi-directionality of the link 
   between any two neighbors. 
 
    
   The operation is concisely described by the following steps: 
   . CE activates the topology LFB/component on the FE to initialize on 
     specific ports 
   . FE topology LFB/component sends neighbor probes/hellos 
   . CE queries FE for its neighbors 
   . FE continues to send these probes afterwards (maintenance) and 
     updates asynchronously any new updates 
    
    
3.2.1. Topology Discovery and Maintenance 
    
   Since the CE needs to maintain consistent and up-to-date view of the 
   inter-FE topology, it needs to obtain real-time information of the 
   status of the internal links connecting the FEs. Since the topology 
   discovery and maintenance occurs during the post-association phase, 
   we make use of the event-notification and query/response messages 
   [ForCESP] of the ForCES protocol to provide this information to the 
   CE. It is important to note that each FE only maintains partial 
   topology   information   obtained   through   neighbor   relationship 
   maintenance through Hello messages. The partial topology view seen 
   by each FE is only the neighbor connectivity information. The CE has 
   to derive the complete topology view of the interconnected FEs based 
   on the partial topology information reported by each FE (or queried 
Ansari et al.             Expires: Jan 2005                  [Page 7] 
Internet Draft             ForCES Discovery                  July 2004 
   by the CE). This ensures that that only the CE maintains all the 
   intelligence and the protocol operation on the FEs is very simple 
   and  has  minimal  overhead.  However,  as  mentioned  above,  if 
   optimizations can be performed by having the complete topology 
   information available at the FEs, the CE can push such information 
   to any FE interested in it (interest on the FE may be shown in the 
   form of policy configuration). This is an optional feature available 
   on each FE, which can be turned on or off through configuration or 
   during capability exchange negotiation at setup time. Each FE vendor 
   may decide to make use of this feature in different ways, so the 
   capability to obtain such topology information should exist. 
 
   The periodic Hello messages maintain PE neighbor relationships. 
   Any change in the link or neighbor status causes the FE to generate 
   an  asynchronous/event-driven  message  to  the  CE  indicating  this 
   change. The mechanism defined in [ForCESP] is used for delivering 
   event-driven messages from the FE to the CE. This involves the CE 
   subscribing to such event-driven messages from the FE.   
 
   The CE aggregates the partial topology information received from 
   each FE and generates the inter-FE topology. With this complete 
   knowledge of the inter-FE topology, it can now make appropriate 
   updates to the LFB tables on each FE to move packets inside the NE ¡ 
   from ingress FE to egress FE, assuming that the destination of the 
   packet is not the current NE itself. Any changes in the internal 
   link  states  (and  hence  the  topology)  requires  that  the  CE 
   reconfigure the LFB tables on the FEs based on the most up-to-date 
   information to ensure that the packets do not end up in a black hole 
   or enter a loop.  
    
    
3.2.2. Full topology computation at the CE from partial topologies 
    
   The CE receives neighbor relationships information from each FE that 
   it uses to construct the full topology of the internal network. Each 
   FEÆs neighbor relationship table contains information regarding the 
   local element ID, local port connecting the neighbor, the neighborÆs 
   ID, the neighborÆs port and any optional additional information. 
   Note that the fact that the FE already knows the neighborÆs port 
   information implies that it received the probe/hello messages from 
   the neighbor on that port in response to the hello sent and was, 
   therefore, able to establish bi-directionality of the link. If all 
   the links in the internal network are point-to-point links, the CE 
   simply  has  to  aggregate  all  the  neighbor  relationship  tables 
   obtained from all the FEs to generate the full topology. If we 
   assume the topology to be a graph, each edge of the graph will be 
   present twice ¡ essentially providing the same information from the 
   two endpoints of the graph. After deleting all the duplicate entries 
   (and thus reducing the table size by half), the CE now has accurate

3.4. Inter-FE Topology Discovery Examples 
    
   The following examples illustrate the topology discovery mechanism. 
   For sake of simplicity, we assume that there is only one CE per NE. 
   The FEIDs of the FEs in the topologies below are FE1, FE2, FE3, and 
   FE4. Each FE has port IDs labeled alphabetically. This is also the 
   case with the CE.

   During the element-binding phase, each FE sends out hello messages 
   with its FEID and Port ID (as outlined earlier) to all of its 
   neighbors. Since each neighboring FE also listens to such messages, 
   it  receives  the  hello  message  and  adds  it  to  the  neighbor 
   association table, which may look like that shown in Fig.4(a). In 
   the topology discovery phase, which is post ForCES association 
   stage, the CE queries each FE about its neighbor table. The FE 
   responds  back  with  the  partial  topology  information  available 
   through its neighbor relationships. Both the query and the response 
   are carried by the ForCES protocol. The CE collects the partial 
   topology information from all the FEs in the NE and aggregates this 
   information to fully construct the inter-FE topology. Any changes to 
   the FE neighbor table, e.g. when a link state changes, generates a 
   trigger/update message to the CE. The new information is used to 
   recalculate  the  new  topology  and  subsequently  the  CE  takes 
   appropriate actions based on the new topology ¡ such as updating the 
   packet forwarding tables on the FEs. 
 
   The following examples show the neighbor association tables.
