Abstract

   This document describes the use of the Common Open Policy Service
   (COPS) protocol for supporting Service Level Specification (SLS)
   negotiation. The [SLS-FRW-TEQ] document has presented the need of a 
   Service Level Specification (SLS). Different works [SLS-TEQ], [SLS-
   AQU], [SLS-INTER] have defined some SLSs for CPE-PE interface and
   inter-domain QoS negotiation. The COPS protocol [COPS] has been
   defined by the IETF Resource Allocation Protocol (RAP) WG [RAP] and
   will be used in this memo to communicate SLS information between
   customer and  network provider.

1. Introduction

   This document describes the use of the Common Open Policy Service
   (COPS) protocol [COPS] for supporting Service Level Specification
   (SLS)negotiation. In [SLS-FRW-TEQ], the author has presented the need
   of a Service Level Specification (SLS). Different works, [SLS-TEQ], 
   [SLS-AQU], [SLS-INTER], have defined some SLSs for CPE-PE interface 
   and inter-domain QoS negotiation. The COPS protocol has been defined 
   by the IETF Resource Allocation Protocol (RAP) WG [RAP] and will be 
   used in this memo to communicate the SLS information between a 
   customer and a network provider.

   Many protocols for supporting SLS negotiation could be envisaged 
   [SLS-FRW-TEQ]. This memo uses COPS protocol for the following
   reasons:
   - Policy-based networking provides interesting architecture concepts
     for service level management.
   - COPS is a flexible protocol which may support multiple client-
     types. The definition of COPS based SLS negotiation protocol needs
     only the specification of appropriate objects corresponding to the
     new client-type (COPS-SLS).
   - If the core network uses COPS to configure network devices, the use
     of the same protocol for SLS negotiation may facilitate the network
     configuration process. 

   Here are the changes since the previous version:
- The PIB defines new classes to represent parameters about FlowId, 
traffic conformance, excess treatment, and scope.
- The error object SLSERR is replaced by the class slsNegoRptEntry in SLS-NEGOTIATION-PIB.
- A discussion about Outsourcing and Provisioning models in COPS-SLS is introduced in section 2.

   As depicted in Figure 1, SLS Policy Client negotiates with the SLS 
   Policy Server using COPS protocol. This negotiation process can take 
   place within an administrative domain or between administrative 
   domains. The SLS PEP represents the customer and the SLS PDP 
   represents the network provider. The customer is the entity  
   consuming network resources of network provider. It may be a company, 
   an Application Service Provider (ASP) or another network provider.
   
   When the SLS-PEP module is activated, the PEP connects to its   
   primary SLS-PDP. The SLS-PDP is a server who manages all SLSs of an 
   administrative domain. The SLS-PDP gets to its Policy Repository to 
   retrieve the policy. The SLS policy helps the SLS-PDP to accept or 
   reject the requested SLS. The SLS-PDP MAY also suggest another SLS to 
   be applied to the PEP.

   Once an SLS-PDP and SLS-PEP agreed on a Service Level, the SLS-PDP 
   MAY interact with other entities (e.g., a COPS-PR-DiffServ PDP) so
   that the network resources could be properly provisioned. The 
   interaction between the SLS-PDP and the other entities is outside the 
   scope of this document.

2.2 Outsourcing and Provisioning models in COPS-SLS:

   The COPS-SLS uses the two common models supported by COPS protocol:
   Outsourcing model and Configuration (a.k.a. Provisioning) model. 

   During the negotiation phase, the customer requests a service by 
   triggering the PEP function which negotiate the desired SLS with the 
   provider. The decision sent by the PDP addresses the desired SLS sent 
   by the PEP. There is a direct 1:1 correlation between PEP events and 
   PDP decisions. Therefore, the negotiation phase follows the 
   Outsourcing mode as defined in RFC3084, section 1 [RFC 3084]

   In order to make the negotiation configurable according to the domain 
   policies, a configuration phase is used in COPS-SLS. The 
   configuration phase follows the COPS Provisioning mode defined in 
   RFC3084, section 1 [RFC 3084]. The domain negotiation policies are 
   provisioned down to the customer. These policies indicate the service 
   offered by a provider, this can be the negotiable parameters, the 
   value constraints of these parameters, the dynamic level of the 
   negotiation, etc. The configuration phase is also useful to provision 
   pre-defined service templates that can be requested as is by the 
   customer in case there is a correspondence with its own needs.  

   The negotiation phase follows the Outsourcing mode. However, SLS 
   negotiation information representation in the ClientSI object can be 
   either in built-in object format or in named data structure format
   depending on the protocol designer. We have chosen the named data 





Nguyen, et al.               Expires August 2002              [Page 4]

Internet Draft                   COPS-SLS                  February 2002


   structure format (a.k.a, PIB) for the following reasons:
   - The information carried by the protocol is separated from the 
   protocol itself. When new information needs to be carried, only 
   the PIB is revisited, the protocol operation and objects remain 
   unchanged. This characteristic is interesting for negotiation 
   protocol design because the set of negotiation parameters can be 
   extensible. 

   - It is better to have the same data representation in both     
   configuration phase and negotiation phase. As the configuration phase 
   uses PIB as defined in COPS-PR, we also use PIB to transport SLS 
   information in the negotiation phase. 

   During 52th IETF meeting in Salt Lake City, there was a discussion 
   about the use of both Outsourcing and Provisioning modes in some 
   client-types. There are some propositions to call this combination 
   ôunified modeö or ôCOPS-PR usage in Outsourcing modeö. However, this 
   terminology and the use of Named or Signaled ClientSI object to 
   convey PIB in Outsourcing mode are not yet clearly defined at the 
   moment. So that, the use of Named ClientSI object for the 
   configuration phase and Signaled ClientSI object for the negotiation 
   phase remains unchanged in this version. COPS-SLS will follow the 
   instructions of future RAP WG documents or discussions.


3. Message Content

This section presents the content of the Request, Decision and Report messages.

3.1. Request message (REQ)  PEP -> PDP

   The REQ message is sent by the SLS-PEP to the SLS-PDP with the
   following format:

               <Request> ::= <Common Header>
                             <Client Handle>
                             <Context>
                             *(<Named ClientSI>)
                             *(<Signaled ClientSI>)
                             [<Integrity>]

   Note that *(<entity>) means zero or more <entity>(s). The COPS
   objects IN-Int, OUT-Int and LPDPDecisions are not included in a COPS-
   SLS Request.

   The Named ClientSI object is included in the REQ message when the
   Context object specifies a 'configuration request' (Configuration

   model). This object is used to inform the PDP about the PEP
   negotiation capabilities and all predefined SLS available in the PEP. 

   The Signaled ClientSI object is included in the REQ message when the
   Context object specifies a 'resource-allocation request' (Outsourcing
   model). This object is used to transport the SLS requested by the
   PEP.

3.2. Decision message (DEC) PDP -> PEP

   The DEC message is sent by the SLS-PDP to the SLS-PEP with the
   following format:

      <Decision Message> ::= <Common Header>
                             <Client Handle>
                             *(<Decision>) | <Error>
                             [<Integrity>]

              <Decision> ::= <Context>
                             <Decision Flags>
                             *(<Named Decision Data>)
                             *(<Client Specific Decision Data>)

   A solicited DEC message is sent from the PDP to answer a REQ message
   sent by the PEP. Unsolicited DEC messages may be sent by the PDP
   to transport the updated policy information. The Client-Handle value
   identifies the request the PDP wants to send its decision to.
   The Context object specifies the context of the decision
   ('configuration' or 'resource-allocation').

   The Named Decision Data object is included in the DEC message when
   the Context object specifies a 'configuration' decision. This object
   is used to transport the negotiation configuration (e.g., negotiation
   mode, predefined SLSs, ...) which the PDP wants to install/remove
   in/from the PEP. The action 'install' or 'remove' is specified in the
   Decision Flags object.

   If the Context object specifies a 'resource allocation' decision, the
   Client Specific Decision Data object is included in the DEC message
   only when the PDP suggests another SLS. The Decision Flags object
   will specify the action of 'install' in this case. When the PDP does
   not suggest another SLS, the Client Specific Decision Data object
   MUST NOT be included in the DEC message because the Decision Flags
   object is sufficient to accept/reject the SLS requested by the PEP.
   
3.3. Report State message (RPT) PEP -> PDP

   The RPT message is sent by the SLS-PEP to the SLS-PDP with the

Internet Draft                    COPS-SLS                 February 2002


   following format:

               <Report State> ::= <Common Header>
                                  <Client Handle>
                                  <Report Type>
                                  *(<Named ClientSI>)
                                  *(<Signaled ClientSI>)
                                  [<Integrity>]

   A solicited RPT message MUST be sent by the PEP upon receipt of a DEC
   message from the PDP. The Client-Handle object contains the same
   value as the Client-Handle value in the DEC message to which the PEP
   wants to make a report.

   The Report-Type object is used to specify the action (success/fail)
   taken by the PEP.  The ClientSI objects are eventually included in
   the RPT message to transport error/accounting information. 

4. COPS-SLS protocol objects and Client-Specific data formats:

4.1 COPS-SLS protocol objects:

   The COPS-SLS protocol objects follow the same object formats defined
   in [COPS-PR]. More precisely, six objects (PRID object, PPRID object,
   EPD object, GPERR object, CPERR object and ErrorPRID object) are
   defined in section 4 of [COPS-PR].

                       
4.2 Client-Specific data format:

     
   The Named ClientSI object and the Signaled ClientSI object used in
   the REQ message have the same format as the ClientSI Request Data
   defined in section 5.2 of [COPS-PR]. 

   The Named Decision Data object and the Client Specific Decision Data
   object used in the DEC have the same format as the Named Decision
   Data defined in section 5.1 of [COPS-PR]. 

   The Named ClientSI object used in the RPT message has the same format
   as the Policy Provisioning Report Data defined in section 5.3 of
   [COPS-PR].

   The Signaled ClientSI object used in the RPT message has the same
   format as the Policy Provisioning Report Data defined in section 5.3
   of [COPS-PR], but in the case of a 'Failure' Report-Type due to the
   reject of the PDP suggested SLS, the PEP MUST send a report 
   indicating 'slsNonAccepted' using slsNegoRptEntry PRC.

                Figure 2: Example of COPS-SLS operation

   The next section describes the Common Operation on the COPS-SLS
   connection between the PEP and the PDP.

   When the SLS-PEP module is activated, the PEP connects to its
   primary SLS-PDP and sends the OPN message with a Client-Type=COPS-
   SLS (Figure 2 - step 1).

   If the PDP accepts this PEP, it sends to the PEP a CAT message
   (Figure 2 - step 2). Otherwise, it sends a CC message.

   When the COPS-SLS connection is successfully established, the PEP
   sends the first REQ with a Context='configuration request'. The
   Named ClientSI object is used in this request to inform the PDP about
   the capabilities of the PEP (e.g, the PRCs the PEP understands, the
   negotiation mode the PEP supports, ...) and all existing predefined
   SLS (Figure 2 - step 3). 

   The predefined SLS is defined in [SLS-AQU] as an SLS with predefined 
   values (or a range of values) for a subset of the parameters in the
   generic SLS. 

   In predefined SLS mode, the PDP installs all predefined SLS in
   the PEP. The PEP CAN only request an SLS conforming to one of
   these predefined SLSs. The PEP MUST NOT request an SLS outside these
   predefined SLSs. 
 
   In non-predefined SLS mode, the PEP CAN request an SLS with any
   parameter values. 

   Upon receipt of the REQ message, the PDP sends a solicited DEC
   message with a Context='configuration' and installs the configuration
   information at the PEP (Figure 2 - step 4).

   After receiving the DEC message, the PEP installs the configuration
   sent by the PDP and sends a RPT message to the PDP to report the
   installation result (Figure 2 - step 5).

   If the configuration is successfully installed, the PEP CAN now send
   a REQ message with a Context='resource-allocation' to request the
   desired SLS (Figure 2 - step 6).

   In response to the REQ message, the PDP sends a DEC message with the
   same context (i.e., resource-allocation). The PDP can accept the
   requested SLS, or reject the requested SLS, or suggest another SLS.
   To accept the requested SLS, the PDP sends a DEC message with a
   Decision-Flags='Install' (Figure 2 - step 7). To reject the requested 
   SLS, the PDP sends a DEC message with a Decision-Flags='Remove'. To
   suggest another SLS, the PDP sends a DEC message with a Decision-

   Flags='install' and includes the suggested SLS in the Client Specific
   Decision Data object. 

   If the PEP receives a DEC message accepting/rejecting the requested
   SLS, it installs the decision and sends a 'success' report to the PDP
   (Figure 2 - step 8). If the PEP cannot install the decision,
   it sends a 'failure' report to the PDP including the corresponding
   Error object. If the PEP receives a DEC message suggesting another
   SLS, it can accept the suggestion by sending a RPT message with a
   Report-Type=Success or reject the suggested SLS by sending a RPT
   message with a Report-Type=Failure and an instance of the PRC 
   SlsNegoRptEntry with a 'slsNegoRptFailRea = 1'.

   If the PEP wants to modify some parameters of a negotiated SLS, it
   sends a REQ message using the Client-Handle value identifying the SLS
   and includes in the Signaled ClientSI object the SLS with its new
   parameter values.

   To delete a requested SLS, the PEP sends a DRQ message using the
   Client-Handle value identifying the SLS to be deleted. 

   At any time, the PDP CAN send an unsolicited DEC message to supply
   the PEP with the updated policy information or to degrade some
   negotiated SLS.

   If the PEP receives a SSQ message, it reissues all requested SLSs and
   finishes the synchronization period by the SSC message.
