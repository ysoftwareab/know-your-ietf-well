   3 Scope 
      
     This document specifies the mapping of defect states between a 
     Pseudo Wire and the Attachment Circuits (AC) of the end-to-end 
     emulated service.  This document covers the case whereby the ACs 
     and the PWs are of the same type in accordance to the PWE3 
     architecture [PWEARCH] such that a homogenous PW service can be 
     constructed.  
      
     Ideally only PW and AC defects need be propagated into the Native 
     Service (NS), and NS OAM mechanisms are transported transparently 
     over the PW. Some homogenous scenarios use PW specific OAM 
     mechanisms to synchronize defect state between PEs due to

     discontinuities in native service OAM between the AC and the PW 
     (e.g. FR LMI), or lack of native service OAM (e.g. Ethernet). 
       
     The objective of this document is to standardize the behavior of 
     PEs with respects to failures on PWs and ACs, so that there is no 
     ambiguity about the alarms generated and consequent actions 
     undertaken by PEs in response to specific failure conditions. 
      
     This document covers PWE over MPLS PSN, PWE over IP PSN and PWE 
     over L2TP PSN.

     The rest of this document will follow the following convention:  
          
     The PW can ride over three types of Packet Switched Network (PSN). 
     A PSN which makes use of LSPs as the tunneling technology to 
     forward the PW packets will be referred to as an MPLS PSN. A PSN 
     which makes use of MPLS-in-IP tunneling [MPLS-in-IP], with a MPLS 
     shim header used as PW demultiplexer, will be referred to as an 
     MPLS-IP PSN. A PSN, which makes use of L2TPv3 [L2TPv3] as the 
     tunneling technology, will be referred to as L2TP-IP PSN. 
      
     If LSP-Ping is run over a PW as described in [VCCV] it will be 
     referred to as VCCV-Ping.  
         
     If BFD is run over a PW as described in [VCCV] it will be referred 
     to as VCCV-BFD.

     In the context of this document a PE forwards packets between an 
     AC and a PW. The other PE that terminates the PW is the ææpeerÆÆ PE 
     and the attachment circuit associated with the far end PW 
     termination is the ææremote ACÆÆ.  
      
     Defects are discussed in the context of defect states, and the 
     criteria to enter and exit the defect state. 
      
     The direction of defects is discussed from the perspective of the 
     observing PE and what the PE may explicitly know about information 
     transfer capabilities of the PW service. 
      
     A forward defect is one that impacts information transfer to the 
     observing PE. It impacts the observing PEÆs ability to receive 
     information. A forward defect MAY also imply impact on information 
     sent or relayed by the observer (and as it cannot receive is 
     therefore unknowable) and so the forward defect state is 
     considered to be a superset of the two defect states. 
      
     A reverse defect is one that uniquely impacts information sent or 
     relayed by observer.  
      
     At the present time code points for forward defect and reverse 
     defect have not been specified for BFD and LDP PW control. These 
     are referred to as ææforward defectÆÆ and ææreverse defectÆÆ 
     indications as placeholders for code point assignment. However, a 
     mapping to existing PW status code points [IANA] may be performed: 
      
          Forward defect - corresponds to the logical OR of 
                  Local Attachment Circuit ( ingress ) Receive Fault 
                                  AND 
                  Local PSN-facing PW ( egress ) Transmit Fault 
      
          Reverse defect - corresponds to the logical OR of 
                  Local Attachment Circuit ( egress ) Transmit Fault 
                                  AND  
                  Local PSN-facing PW ( egress ) Receive Fault 
      
   5 Reference Model and Defect Locations 
      
     Figure 1 illustrates the PWE3 network reference model with an 
     indication of the possible defect locations. This model will be 
     referenced in the remainder of this document for describing the 
     OAM procedures.

                  Figure 1: PWE3 Network Defect Locations 
     In all interworking scenarios described in this document, it is 
     assumed that at PE1 the AC and the PW are of the same type. The 
     procedures described in this document exclusively apply to PE1.  
     PE2 for a homogenous service implements the identical 
     functionality (although it is not required to as long as the 
     notifications across the PWs are consistent).  
      
     The following is a brief description of the defect locations: 
      
     (a)  Defect in the first L2 network (N1). This covers any defect 
          in the N1 which impacts all or a subset of ACs terminating in 
          PE1. The defect is conveyed to PE1 and to the remote L2 
          network (N2) using the native service specific OAM defect 
          indication. 
     (b)  Defect on a PE1 AC interface. 
     (c)  Defect on a PE PSN interface. 
     (d)  Defect in the PSN network. This covers any defect in the PSN 
          which impacts all or a subset of the PSN tunnels and PWs 
          terminating in a PE. The defect is conveyed to the PE using a 
          PSN and/or a PW specific OAM defect indication. Note that 
          control plane, i.e., signaling and routing, messages do not 
          necessarily follow the path of the user plane messages. 
          Defect in the control plane are detected and conveyed 
          separately through control plane mechanisms. However, in some 
          cases, they have an impact on the status of the PW as 
          explained in the next section. 
     (e)  Defect in the second L2 network (N2). This covers any defect 
          in N2 which impacts all or a subset of ACs terminating in PE2 
          (which is considered a ææremote AC defectÆÆ in the context of 
          procedures outlined in this draft). The defect is conveyed to 
          PE2 and to the remote L2 network (N1) using the native 
          service OAM defect indication.  
     (f)  Defect on a PE2 AC interface (which is also considered a

     PE1 is obliged to track four abstract defect states that reflect 
     the observed state of both directions of the PW service on both 
     the AC and the PW sides. Faults may impact only one or both 
     directions of the PW.  
      
     The observed state is a combination of faults directly detected by 
     PE1, or faults it has been made aware of via notifications.

     PE1 will directly detect or be notified of AC forward and PW 
     forward defects as they occur upstream of PE1 and impact traffic 
     being sent to PE1. PE1 will only be notified of AC reverse and PW 
     reverse defects as they universally will be detected by other 
     devices and only impact traffic that has already been relayed by 
     PE1. 
      
     The procedures outlined in this document define the entry and exit 
     criteria for each of the four states with respect to the set of 
     potential ACs and PWs within the document scope and the consequent 
     actions that PE1 must perform to properly interwork those 
     notifications. The abstract defect states used by PE1 are common 
     to all potential interworking combinations of PWs and ACs. 
      
     When a PE has multiple sources of notifications from a peer (e.g. 
     PSN and LDP control plane), it is obliged to track all sources, 
     but with respect to consequent actions the forward state ALWAYS 
     has precedence over the reverse state. 
      
   7 PW Status and Defects 
      
     This section describes possible PW defects, ways to detect them 
     and consequent actions. 

   7.1 PW Defects  
       
     Possible defects that impact PWs are the following.     
          
     . Physical layer defect in the PSN interface 
      
     . PSN tunnel failure which results in a loss of connectivity 
     between ingress and egress PE.  
   
     . Control session failures between ingress and egress PE  
          
     In case of an MPLS PSN and an MPLS-IP PSN there are additional 
     defects:  
          
     . PW labeling error, which is due to a defect in the ingress PE,or 
     to an over-writing of the PW label value somewhere along the LSP 
     path.  
          

    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                 [Page 8]  
   
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     . LSP tunnel Label swapping errors or LSP tunnel label merging 
     errors in the MPLS network. This could result in the termination 
     of a PW at the wrong egress PE.  
      
     . Unintended self-replication; e.g., due to loops or denial-of-
     service attacks. 

   7.1.1 Packet Loss  
       
     Persistent congestion in the PSN or in a PE could impact the 
     proper operation of the emulated service.  
      
     A PE can detect packet loss resulting from congestion through 
     several methods. If a PE uses the sequence number field in the 
     PWE3 Control Word for a specific Pseudo Wire [PWEARCH], it has the 
     ability to detect packet loss. [CONGESTION] discusses other 
     possible mechanisms to detect congestion between PWs.  
      
     Generally, there are congestion alarms which are raised in the 
     node and to the management system when congestion occurs. The 
     decision to declare the PW Down and to re-signal it through 
     another path is usually at the discretion of the network operator. 

   7.2 Defect Detection and Notification 

   7.2.1 Defect Detection Tools  
       
     To detect the defects listed in 7.1, Service Providers have a 
     variety of options available:  
      
     Physical Layer defect detection and notification mechanisms such 
     as SONET/SDH LOS, LOF,and AIS/FERF. 
      
     PSN Defect Detection Mechanisms:  
          
     For PWE3 over an L2TP-IP PSN, with L2TP as encapsulation protocol, 
     the defect detection mechanisms described in [L2TPv3] apply. 
     Furthermore, the tools Ping and Traceroute, based on ICMP Echo 
     Messages apply [ICMP].  
          
     For PWE3 over an MPLS PSN and an MPLS-IP PSN, several tools can be 
     used.  
     . LSP-Ping and LSP-Traceroute( [LSPPING]) for LSP tunnel 
     connectivity verification. 
      
     . LSP-Ping with Bi-directional Forwarding Detection ([BFD]) for 
     LSP tunnel continuity checking. 
      
     .Furthermore, if RSVP-TE is used to setup the PSN Tunnels between 
     ingress and egress PE, the hello protocol can be used to detect 


    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                 [Page 9]  
   
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     loss of connectivity (see [RSVP-TE]), but only at the control 
     plane. 
      
     PW specific defect detection mechanisms:  
          
     [VCCV] describes how LSP-Ping and BFD can be used over individual 
     PWs for connectivity verification and continuity checking 
     respectively. When used as such, we will refer to them as VCCV-
     Ping and VCCV-BFD respectively.     
   
     Furthermore, the detection of a fault could occur at different 
     points in the network and there are several ways the observing PE 
     determines a fault exists: 
      
          a. egress PE detection of failure (e.g. BFD)  
          b. ingress PE detection of failure (e.g. LSP-PING) 
          c. ingress PE notification of failure (e.g. RSVP Path-err) 

   7.2.2 Defect Detection Mechanism Applicability  
       
     The discussion below is intended to give some perspective how 
     tools mentioned in the previous section can be used to detect 
     failures.   
          
     Observations:  
          
     . Tools like LSP-Ping and BFD can be run periodically or on 
     demand. If used for defect detection, as opposed to diagnostic 
     usage, they must be run periodically.  
          
     . Control protocol failure indications, e.g. detected through L2TP 
     Keep-alive messages or the RSVP-TE Hello messages, can be used to 
     detect many network failures. However, control protocol failures 
     do not necessarily coincide with data plane failures. Therefore, a 
     defect detection mechanism in the data plane is required to 
     protect against all potential data plane failures. Furthermore, 
     fault diagnosis mechanisms for data plane failures are required to 
     further analyze detected failures. 
          
     . For PWE3 over an MPLS PSN and an MPLS-IP PSN, it is effective to 
     run a defect detection mechanism over a PSN Tunnel frequently and 
     run one over every individual PW within that PSN Tunnel less 
     frequently. However in case the PSN traffic is distributed over 
     Equal Cost Multi Paths (ECMP), it may be difficult to guarantee 
     that PSN OAM messages follow the same path as a specific PW. A 
     Service Provider might therefore decide to focus on defect 
     detection over PWs.  
          
     . In MPLS networks, execution of LSP Ping would detect MPLS label 
     errors, since it requests the receiving node to match the label 
     with the original FEC that was used in the LSP set up. BFD can 
     also be used since it relies on discriminators. A label error 
    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                [Page 10]  
   
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     would result in a mismatch between the expected discriminator and 
     the actual discriminator in the BFD control messages.  
          
     . For PWE3 over an MPLS PSN and an MPLS-IP PSN, PEs could detect 
     PSN label errors through the execution of LSP-Ping. However, use 
     of VCCV is preferred as it is a more accurate detection tool for 
     pseudowires. 
     Furthermore, it can be run using a BFD mode, i.e., VCCV-BFD, which 
     allows it to be used as a light-weight detection mechanism for 
     PWs. If, due to a label error in the PSN, a PW would be terminated 
     on the wrong egress PE, PEs would detect this through the 
     execution of VCCV. LSP ping and/or LSP trace could then be used to 
     diagnose the detected failure. 
        
     Based on these observations, it is clear that a service provider 
     has the disposal of a variety of tools. There are many factors 
     that influence which combination of tools best meets its needs. 

   7.3 Overview of fault notifications  
     For a MPLS PSN and a IP PSN using MPLS-in-IP (MPLS-IP PSN), PW 
     status signaling messages are used as the default mechanism for AC 
     and PW status and defect indication [PWE3-CONTROL]. 
      
     For a IP PSN using L2TPv3, i.e., a L2TP-IP PSN, StopCCN and CDN 
     messages are used for conveying defects in the PSN and PW 
     respectively, while the Set-Link-Info (SLI) messages are used to 
     convey status and defects in the AC and local L2 network. 
      
     Optionally, PEs can negotiate the use of VCCV-BFD for both PW 
     fault detection and AC/PW fault notifications as explained in 
     [VCCV]. What BFD is used for is negotiated: 
              i. not used 
             ii. used for PW fault detection (which implies reverse 
                 notifications) 
            iii. used for PW fault detection and all PW/AC fault 
                 notifications 
      
     When BFD is to be used for all fault notifications, then BFD is 
     the preferred mechanism of exchanging fault notifications. 
      
     PE1 will translate the PW defect states to the appropriate failure 
     indications on the affected ACs. The exact procedures depend on 
     the emulated protocols and will be discussed in the next sections.   

   7.3.1 Use of Native Service notifications  
     In the context of this document, ATM and unstructured SONET/TDM 
     PWs are the only examples of a PW that has native service 
     notification capability. Frame relay does have the FR OAM 
     specification [FRF.19], but this is not commonly deployed. All 
     other PWs use PW specific notification mechanisms. 
      

    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                [Page 11]  
   
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     ATM PWs may optionally also use PW specific notification 
     mechanisms. 
      
     In normal, i.e., defect-free, operation, all the types of ATM OAM 
     cells described in Section 14.2 are either terminated at the PE, 
     for OAM segments terminating in the AC endpoint, or transparently 
     carried over the PSN tunnel [PWE3-ATM]. This is referred to as 
     ææinband ATM OAM over PWÆÆ and is the default method.  
      
     An optional out-of band method based on relaying the ATM defect 
     state over a PW specific defect indication mechanism is provided 
     for PEÆs which cannot generate and/or transmit ATM OAM cells over 
     the ATM PW. This is referred to as ææOut-of-band ATM OAM over PWÆÆ.  

   7.3.2 The Use of PW Status for MPLS and MPLS-IP PSNs 
     This document specifies the use of PW status signaling as the 
     default mechanism for the purpose of conveying the status of a PW 
     and ACs between PEs. 
      
     For a MPLS PSN and a IP PSN using MPLS-in-IP (MPLS-IP PSN), PW 
     status signaling messages are used as the default mechanism for AC 
     and PW status and defect indication [PWE3-CONTROL].  
      
     PW status is used to convey the defect view of the PW local to the 
     originating PE. This is the local PW state, and when the NS does 
     not have native OAM capability or emulation of native capability 
     is prohibitive, the AC state. This is in the form of a ææforward 
     defectÆÆ or a ææreverse defectÆÆ. 

   7.3.3 The Use of L2TP STOPCCN and CDN  
          
     [L2TPv3] describes the use of STOPCCN and CDN messages to exchange 
     alarm information between PEs. Like PW Status, STOPCCN and CDN 
     messages shall be used to report the following failures:  
          
     . Failures detected through defect detection mechanisms in the 
     L2TP-IP PSN  
          
     . Failures detected through VCCV (except for VCCV-BFD)  
          
     . Failures within the PE that result in an inability to forward 
     traffic between ACs and PW  
           
     In L2TP, the Set-Link-Info (SLI) message is used to convey 
     failures on the ACs.  

   7.3.4 The Use of BFD Diagnostic Codes  
       
     If the PEs have negotiated the use of VCCV-BFD for both PW fault 
     detection and AC/PW fault notifications as explained in [VCCV] 


    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                [Page 12]  
   
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     then BFD is the preferred mechanism of exchanging fault 
     notifications. 
      
     [BFD] defines a set of diagnostic codes that partially overlap 
     with failures that can be communicated through PW Status messages 
     or L2TP STOPCCN and CDN messages. To avoid ambiguous situations, 
     these messages SHOULD be used for all failures that are detected 
     through means other than BFD.   
          
     For VCCV-BFD, therefore, only the following diagnostic codes 
     apply:  
      
     Code   Message   
     ----   ------------------------------ 
     0      No Diagnostic  
     1      Control Detection Time Expired  
     3      Neighbor Signaled Session Down  
     7      Administratively Down  
          
     [VCCV] states that, when used over PWs, the asynchronous mode of 
     BFD should be used. Diagnostic code 2 (Echo Function Failed) does 
     not apply to the asynchronous mode, but to the Demand Mode.  
          
     All other BFD diagnostic codes refer to failures that can be 
     communicated through PW Status or L2TP STOPCCN and CDN.  
          
     The VCCV-BFD procedures are as follows:  
          
     When the downstream PE (PE1) does not receive control messages 
     from the upstream PE (PE2) during a certain number of transmission 
     intervals (a number provisioned by the operator), it declares that 
     the PW in its receive direction is down. PE1 sends a message to 
     PE2 with H=0 (i.e. "I do not hear you") and with diagnostic code 
     1. In turn, PE2 declares the PW is down in its transmit direction 
     and it uses diagnostic code 3 in its control messages to PE2.   
       
     When a PW is taken administratively down, the PEs will exchange PW  
     Status messages with code "Pseudo Wire Not Forwarding" or L2TP CDN 
     messages with code "Session disconnected for administrative 
     reasons". In addition, exchange of BFD control messages MUST be 
     suspended. To that end, the PEs MUST send control messages with 
     H=0 and diagnostic code 7.  
          
     In conclusion, one would communicate PW defects through PW Status 
     messages, or L2TP STOPCCN and CDN messages in all cases, except 
     for a well-defined set of exceptions where BFD is used. How PW 
     defects that can be detected through the use of BFD or through 
     other means, are mapped to defect indications on the ACs is 
     described in section Error! Reference source not found. and in 
     subsequent sections.

   8 PW Defect State Entry/Exit  

   8.1 PW Forward Defect Entry/Exit 
       
     A PE will enter the PW forward defect state if one of the 
     following occurs  
      
     . It detects loss of connectivity on the PSN tunnel over which the 
     PW is riding. This includes label swapping errors and label 
     merging errors. 
      
     . It receives a message from PE2 indicating PW ææforward defectÆÆ or 
     ææPW not forwardingÆÆ, which indicates PE2 detected or was notified 
     of a PW fault downstream of it or that there was a remote AC 
     fault. 
                 
     In the case of an L2TP-IP, this is a L2TP StopCCN or CDN message. 
     A StopCCN message indicates that the control connection has been 
     shut down by the remote PE [L2TPv3]. This is typically used for 
     defects in the PSN which impact both the co 
     ntrol connection and the individual data plane sessions. On 
     reception of this message, a PE closes the control connection and 
     will clear all the sessions managed by this control connection. 
     Since each session carries a single PW, the state of the 
     corresponding PWs is changed to DOWN. A CDN message indicates that 
     the remote peer requests the disconnection of a specific session 
     [L2TPv3]. In this case only the state of the corresponding PW is 
     changed to DOWN. This is typically used for local defects in a PE 
     which impact only a specific session and the corresponding PW. 
                  
     . It detects a loss of PW connectivity, including label errors, 
     through VCCV-BFD or VCCV-PING in no reply mode.  
          
     Note that if the PW control session between the PEs fails, the PW 
     is torn down and needs to be re-established. However, the 
     consequent actions towards the ACs are the same as if the PW 
     entered the forward defect state. Precise details of AC defect 
     state entry and exit criteria are specified elsewhere (e.g. I.610) 
     and such references will supersede the descriptions herein. 
      
     PE1 will exit the forward defect state if the notified PW status 
     from the PE2 has the ææforward defectÆÆ indication clear, and it has 
     established that PW/PSN connectivity is working in the forward 
     direction. Note that this may result in a transition to the PW 
     working or PW reverse defect states. 
     For a PWE3 over a L2TP-IP PSN, a PE will exit the PW forward 
     defect state when the following conditions are true: 
      
     .  All defects it had previously detected have disappeared, and  
          

    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                [Page 14]  
   
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     . A L2TPv3 session is successfully established to carry the PW 
     packets. 

   8.2 PW reverse defect state entry/exit  
      
     A PE will enter the PW reverse defect state if one of the 
     following occurs  
      
     . It receives a message from PE2 indicating PW ææreverse defectÆÆ 
     which indicates PE2 detected or was notified of a PW/PSN fault 
     upstream of it or that there was a remote AC fault and it is not 
     already in the PW forward defect state.  
      
     PE1 will exit the reverse defect state if the notified PW status 
     from the PE2 has the ææreverse defectÆÆ indication clear, or it has 
     entered the PW forward defect state. 
      
     For a PWE3 over a L2TP-IP PSN, a PE will exit the PW reverse 
     defect state when the following conditions are true: 
      
     . All defects it had previously detected have disappeared, and  
          
     . A L2TPv3 session is successfully established to carry the PW 
     packets. 

   8.2.1 PW reverse defects that are treated as AC Forward Defects 
      
     Some PW mechanisms will result in PW defects being detected by or 
     notified to PE1 when PE1 is upstream of the fault but the 
     notification did not originate with PE2. The resultant actions are 
     identical to that of entering the AC forward defect state as PE1 
     needs to synchronize state with PE2 and the PW state communicated 
     from PE1 to PE2 needs to indicate state accordingly. 
       
     When the PSN uses RSVP-TE or proactively uses LSP-PING as a PW 
     fault detection mechanism, PE1 must consider entry to the AC 
     forward defect state to be the logical or of the AC entry criteria 
     outlined for each AC type in the subsequent sections, and that of 
     the known PW state in the direction of PE2 downstream of PE1 
     (indicated via RSVP patherr or LSP-PINGs). 
       
     The exit criteria being when the logical AND of the RSVP fault 
     state, LSP-PING fault state and the actual AC forward defect exit 
     criteria has been met, indicating no forward defects.   
      
   9 AC Defect States 

   9.1 FR ACs 
     PE1 enters the AC Forward Defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met:

     (i)    A PVC is not ædeletedÆ from the Frame Relay network and 
             the Frame Relay network explicitly indicates in a full 
             status report (and optionally by the asynchronous status 
             message) that this Frame Relay PVC is æinactiveÆ. In this 
             case, this status maps across the PE to the corresponding 
             PW only. 
     (ii)   The LIV indicates that the link from the PE to the Frame 
             Relay network is down. In this case, the link down 
             indication maps across the PE to all corresponding PWs. 
     (iii)  A physical layer alarm is detected on the FR interface. In 
             this case, this status maps across the PE to all 
             corresponding PWs. 
     A PE exits the AC Forward Defect state when all defects it had 
     previously detected have disappeared. 
      
     The AC reverse defect state is not valid for FR ACs. 

   9.2 ATM ACs  

   9.2.1 AC Forward Defect State Entry/Exit 
      
     PE1 enters the AC forward defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
     (i)    It detects or is notified of a physical layer fault on the 
             ATM interface and/or it terminates an F4 AIS flow or has 
             loss of F4 CC for a VP carrying VCCÆs. 
     (ii)   It terminates an F4/F5 AIS OAM flow indicating that the 
             ATM VP/VC is down in the adjacent L2 ATM network (e.g., N1 
             for PE1). This is applicable to the case of the ææout-of-
             band ATM OAM over PWÆÆ method only. 
     (iii)  It detects loss of connectivity on the NS ATM VPC/VCC 
             while terminating ATM continuity checking (ATM CC) with 
             the local ATM network and CE. 
      
     A PE exits the AC Forward Defect state when all defects it had 
     previously detected have disappeared. The exact conditions under 
     which a PE exits the AIS state, or declares that connectivity is 
     restored via ATM CC are defined in I.610 [I.610]. 

   9.2.2 AC Reverse Defect State Entry/Exit 
      
     A PE enters the AC reverse defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
     (i)    It terminates an F4/F5 RDI OAM flow indicating that the 
             ATM VP/VC AC is down in the adjacent L2 ATM network (e.g., 
             N1 for PE1). This is applicable to the case of out-of-band 
             ATM OAM over PW only. 
      
     A PE exits the AC Reverse Defect state if the AC state transitions 
     to working or to the AC forward defect state. The criteria for 
     exiting the RDI state are described in I.610.

   9.3 Ethernet AC State 
      
     PE1 enters the forward defect state if any of the following 
     conditions are met: 
      
     (i)    A physical layer alarm is detected on the Ethernet 
             interface. 
      
     A PE exits the Ethernet AC forward defect state when all defects 
     it had previously detected have disappeared. 
      
   10 PW Forward Defect Entry/Exit procedures 

   10.1 PW Forward Defect Entry Procedures 

   10.1.1 FR AC procedures  
     These procedures are applicable only if the transition from the 
     working state to the PW Forward defect state. A transition from PW 
     reverse defect state to the forward defect state does not require 
     any additional notification procedures to the FR AC as it has 
     already been told the peer is down. 
     (i)    PE1 MUST generate a full status report with the Active bit 
             = 0 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
             as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR 
             ACs. 

   10.1.2 Ethernet AC Procedures 
     No procedures are currently defined. 

   10.1.3 ATM AC procedures 
     On entry to the PW Forward Defect State 
     (i)    PE1 MUST commence F5 AIS insertion into the corresponding 
             AC. 
     (ii)   PE1 MUST terminate any F5 CC generation on the 
             corresponding AC. 

   10.1.4 Additional procedures for a FR PW, an ATM PW in the ææout-of-
        band ATM OAM over PW methodÆÆ, and an Ethernet PW 
     If the PW failure was explicitly detected by PE1, it MUST assume 
     PE2 has no knowledge of the defect and MUST notify PE2 in the form 
     of a reverse defect notification: 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (i)    A PW Status message indicating a ææreverse defectÆÆ, or 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code if the optional use of VCCV-BFD 
             notification has been negotiated 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN

  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "active" Or, 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code if the optional use of VCCV-BFD 
             notification has been negotiated  
      
     Otherwise the entry to the defect state was the result of a 
     notification from PE2 (indicating that PE2 already had knowledge 
     of the fault) or loss of the control adjacency (similarly visible 
     to PE2). 

   10.2 PW Forward Defect Exit Procedures 

   10.2.1 FR AC procedures  
     On transition from the PW forward defect state to the reverse 
     defect state PE1 takes no action w.r.t. the AC. 
      
     On exit from the PW Forward defect state 
     (i)    PE1 MUST generate a full status report with the Active bit 
             = 1 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
             as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR 
             ACs.

   10.2.4 Additional procedures for a FR PW, an ATM PW in the ææout-of-
        band ATM OAM over PWÆÆ method, and an Ethernet PW 
     If the PW failure was explicitly detected by PE1, it MUST notify 
     PE2 in the form of clearing the reverse defect notification: 
      
     For PW over MPLS PSN or MPLS-IP PSN 
     (i)    A PW Status message with the ææreverse defectÆÆ indication 
             clear, and the remaining indicators showing either working 
             or a transition to the ææforward defectÆÆ state. Or, 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same attribute as (i) 
             if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated  
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "active" Or, 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code with the same attributes as (i) 
             if the optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been 
             negotiated

   10.3 PW Reverse Defect Entry Procedures 

   10.3.1 FR AC procedures  
     On transition from the PW forward defect state to the reverse 
     defect state PE1 takes no action w.r.t. the AC. 
      
     On entry to the PW reverse defect state 
     (i)    PE1 MUST generate a full status report with the Active bit 
             = 0 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
             as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR 
             ACs. 

   10.3.2 Ethernet AC Procedures 
     No procedures are currently defined 

   10.3.3 ATM AC procedures 
     On entry to the PW Reverse Defect State 
     (i)    PE1 MUST commence F5 RDI insertion into the corresponding 
             AC. This applies to the case of an ATM PW in the ææout-of-
             band ATM OAM over PWÆÆ method only. 

   10.4 PW Reverse Defect Exit Procedures 

   10.4.1 FR AC procedures  
     On transition from the PW reverse defect state to the PW forward 
     defect state PE1 takes no action with respect to the AC. 
      
     On exit from the PW Reverse defect state 
     (i)    PE1 MUST generate a full status report with the Active bit 
             = 1 (and optionally in the asynchronous status message), 
             as per Q.933 annex A, into N1 for the corresponding FR 
             ACs. 

   10.4.2 Ethernet AC Procedures 
     No procedures are currently defined 

   10.4.3 ATM AC procedures 
     On exit from the PW Reverse Defect State 
     (i)    PE1 MUST cease F5 RDI insertion into the corresponding AC. 
     This applies to the case of an ATM PW in the ææout-of-band ATM OAM 
     over PWÆÆ method only. 

   10.5 Procedures in FR Port Mode 
      
     In case of pure port mode, STATUS ENQUIRY and STATUS messages are 
     transported transparently over the PW. A PW Failure will therefore 
     result in timeouts of the Q.933 link and PVC management protocol 
    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                [Page 19]

     at the Frame Relay devices at one or both sites of the emulated 
     interface.  

   10.6 Procedures in ATM Port Mode 
          
     In case of transparent cell transport, i.e., "port mode", where 
     the PE does not keep track of the status of individual ATM VPCs or 
     VCCs, a PE cannot relay PW defect state over these VCCs and VPCs. 
     If ATM CC is run on the VCCs and VPCs end-to-end (CE1 to CE2), or 
     on a segment originating and terminating in the ATM network and 
     spanning the PSN network, it will timeout and cause the CE or ATM 
     switch to enter the ATM AIS state.  
      
   11 AC Defect Entry/Exit Procedures 

   11.1 AC Forward defect entry: 
     On entry to the forward defect state, PE1 may need to perform 
     procedures on both the PW and the AC. 

   11.1.1 Procedures for a FR PW, an ATM PW in the ææout-of-band ATM OAM 
        over PWÆÆ method, or an Ethernet PW

             optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been negotiated. 
      
     For PW over L2TP-IP PSN 
     (i)    An L2TP Set-Link Info (LSI) message with a Circuit Status 
             AVP indicating "inactive", or 
     (ii)   A VCCV-BFD diagnostic code of ææforward defectÆÆ if the 
             optional use of VCCV-BFD notification has been negotiated.

             PW. 
          b. If PE1 is originating F4 or F5 I.610 CC cells, PE1 will 
             suspend CC generation for the duration of the defect 
             state. 

   11.1.3 Additional procedures for ATM ACs 
     On entry to the AC forward defect state PE1 will commence RDI 
     insertion into the AC as per I.610. This procedure is applicable

   12 SONET Encapsulation (CEP)  
       
     [CEP] discusses how Loss of Connectivity and other SONET/SDH 
     protocol failures on the PW are translated to alarms on the ACs 
     and vice versa. In essence, all defect management procedures are 
     handled entirely in the emulated protocol. There is no need for an 
     interaction between PW defect management and SONET layer defect 
     management.  
    
  Nadeau, et al.           Expires August 2005                [Page 22]  
   
  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
          
   13 TDM Encapsulation  
       
     From an OAM perspective, the PSN carrying a TDM PW provides the 
     same function as that of SONET/SDH or ATM network carrying the 
     same low-rate TDM stream. Hence the interworking of defect OAM is 
     similar.  
      
     For structure-agnostic TDM PWs, the TDM stream is to be carried 
     transparently across the PSN, and this requires TDM OAM 
     indications to be transparently transferred along with the TDM 
     data. For structure-aware TDM PWs the TDM structure alignment is 
     terminated at ingress to the PSN and regenerated at egress, and 
     hence OAM indications may need to be signaled by special means. In 
     both cases generation of the appropriate emulated OAM indication 
     may be required when the PSN is at fault. 
      
     Since TDM is a real-time signal, defect indications and 
     performance measurements may be classified into two classes, 
     urgent and deferrable. Urgent messages are those whose contents 
     may not be significantly delayed with respect to the TDM data that 
     they potentially impact, while deferrable messages may arrive at 
     the far end delayed with respect to simultaneously generated TDM 
     data. For example, a forward indication signifying that the TDM 
     data is invalid (e.g. TDM loss of signal, or MPLS loss of packets) 
     is only of use when received before the TDM data is to be played 
     out towards the far end TDM system. It is hence classified as an 
     urgent message, and we can not delegate its signaling to a 
     separate maintenance or management flow. On the other hand, the 
     forward loss of multiframe synchronization, and most reverse 
     indications do not need to be acted upon before a particular TDM 
     frame is played out.  
      
     From the above discussion it is evident that the complete solution 
     to OAM for TDM PWs needs to have at least two, and perhaps three 
     components. The required functionality is transparent transfer of 
     native TDM OAM and urgent transfer of indications (by flags) along 
     with the impacted packets. Optionally there may be mapping between 
     TDM and PSN OAM flows. 
      
     TDM AIS generated in the TDM network due to a fault in that 
     network is generally carried unaltered, although the TDM 
     encapsulations allow for its suppression for bandwidth 
     conservation purposes. Similarly, when the TDM loss of signal is 
     detected at the PE, it will generally emulate TDM AIS.  
      
     SAToP and the two structure-aware TDM encapsulations have 
     converged on a common set of defect indication flags in the PW 
     control word. When the PE detects or is informed of lack of 
     validity of the TDM signal, it raises the local ("L") defect flag, 
     uniquely identifying the defect as originating in the TDM network. 
     The remote PE must ensure that TDM AIS is delivered to the remote 
     TDM network. When the defect lies in the MPLS network, the remote

  Internet Draft    draft-ietf-pwe3-oam-msg-map-02.txt     February 2005 
   
     PE fails to receive packets. The remote PE generates TDM AIS 
     towards its TDM network, and in addition raises the remote defect 
     ("R") flag in its PSN-bound packets, uniquely identifying the 
     defect as originating in the PSN. Finally, defects in the remote 
     TDM network that cause RDI generation in that network, may 
     optionally be indicated by proper setting of the field of valid 
     packets in the opposite direction. 
      
  14 Appendix A: Native Service Management 

   14.1 Frame Relay Management  
          
     The management of Frame Relay Bearer Service (FRBS) connections 
     can be accomplished through two distinct methodologies:  
        
     1. Based on ITU-T Q.933 Annex A, Link Integrity Verification 
     procedure, where STATUS and STATUS ENQUIRY signaling messages are 
     sent using DLCI=0 over a given UNI and NNI physical link. [ITU-T 
     Q.933]  
           
     2. Based on FRBS LMI, and similar to ATM ILMI where LMI is common 
     in private Frame Relay networks.  
       
     In addition, ITU-T I.620 addresses Frame Relay loopback, but the 
     deployment of this standard is relatively limited. [ITU-T I.620]  
           
     It is possible to use either, or both, of the above options to 
     manage Frame Relay interfaces. This document will refer 
     exclusively to Q.933 messages.  
          
     The status of any provisioned Frame Relay PVC may be updated 
     through:  
            
     . STATUS messages in response to STATUS ENQUIRY messages, these 
     are mandatory.  
          
     . Optional unsolicited STATUS updates independent of STATUS 
     ENQUIRY (typically under the control of management system, these 
     updates can be sent periodically (continuous monitoring) or only 
     upon detection of specific defects based on configuration.  
           
     In Frame Relay, a DLC is either up or down. There is no 
     distinction between different directions. TO achieve commonality 
     with other technologies, æædownÆÆ is represented as a forward 
     defect. 
      
     Frame relay connection management is not implemented over the PW 
     using either of the techniques native to FR, therefore PW 
     mechanisms are used to synchronize the view each PE has of the 
     remote NS/AC. A PE will treat a remote NS/AC failure in the same 
     way it would treat a PW or PSN failure, that is using AC facing FR 
     connection management to notify the CE that FR is æædownÆÆ.

   14.2 ATM Management  
        
     ATM management and OAM mechanisms are much more evolved than those 
     of Frame Relay.  There are five broad management-related 
     categories, including fault management (FT), Performance 
     management (PM), configuration management (CM), Accounting 
     management (AC), and Security management (SM). ITU-T 
     Recommendation I.610 describes the functions for the operation and 
     maintenance of the physical layer and the ATM layer, that is, 
     management at the bit and cell levels ([ITU-T I.610]). Because of 
     its scope, this document will concentrate on ATM fault management 
     functions. Fault management functions include the following:  
           
     1) Alarm indication signal (AIS)  
     2) Remote Defect indication (RDI).  
     3) Continuity Check (CC).  
     4) Loopback (LB)  
           
     Some of the basic ATM fault management functions are described as 
     follows: Alarm indication signal (AIS) sends a message in the same 
     direction as that of the signal, to the effect that an error has 
     been detected.  
          
     Remote defect indication (RDI) sends a message to the transmitting 
     terminal that an error has been detected. RDI is also referred to 
     as the far-end reporting failure. Alarms related to the physical 
     layer are indicated using path AIS/RDI. Virtual path AIS/RDI and 
     virtual channel AIS/RDI are also generated for the ATM layer.  
           
     OAM cells (F4 and F5 cells) are used to instrument virtual paths 
     and virtual channels respectively with regard to their performance 
     and availability. OAM cells in the F4 and F5 flows are used for 
     monitoring a segment of the network and end-to-end monitoring. OAM 
     cells in F4 flows have the same VPI as that of the connection 
     being monitored. OAM cells in F5 flows have the same VPI and VCI 
     as that of the connection being monitored.  The AIS and RDI 
     messages of the F4 and F5 flows are sent to the other network 
     nodes via the VPC or the VCC to which the message refers. The type 
     of error and its location can be indicated in the OAM cells. 
     Continuity check is another fault management function. To check 
     whether a VCC that has been idle for a period of time is still 
     functioning, the network elements can send continuity-check cells 
     along that VCC. 

   14.3 Ethernet Management  
      
     At this point in time, inband Ethernet OAM standards are being 
     specified in the International Telecommunications Union -
                                                             - 
     Telecommunications (ITU-T) and the Institute of Electrical and 
     Electronics Engineers (IEEE). However, it will take some time

     before they are widely deployed. Therefore, this document 
     specifies only the procedures for mapping a defect due to a 
     Ethernet physical layer fault. Defects on a remote Ethernet AC or 
     defects in a PW cannot be mapped back to the local Ethernet 
     network. 
      
   15 Security Considerations 
      
     The mapping messages described in this document do not change the 
     security functions inherent in the actual messages.
