  A YANG Data Model for Segment Routing in IPv6 (SRv6) support in Path
           Computation Element Communications Protocol (PCEP)
                     draft-li-pce-pcep-srv6-yang-01

Abstract

   This document augments a YANG data model for the management of Path
   Computation Element communications Protocol (PCEP) for communications
   between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and a Path Computation
   Element (PCE), or between two PCEs in support for Segment Routing in
   IPv6.  The data model includes configuration data and state data
   (status information and counters for the collection of statistics).

1.  Introduction

   The Path Computation Element (PCE) defined in [RFC4655] is an entity
   that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
   network graph, and applying computational constraints.  A Path
   Computation Client (PCC) may make requests to a PCE for paths to be
   computed.

   PCEP is the communication protocol between a PCC and PCE and is
   defined in [RFC5440].  PCEP interactions include path computation
   requests and path computation replies as well as notifications of
   specific states related to the use of a PCE in the context of
   Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) and Generalized MPLS (GMPLS)
   Traffic Engineering (TE).  [RFC8231] specifies extensions to PCEP to
   enable stateful control of MPLS TE LSPs.

   [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] extends [RFC8664] to support SR
   for IPv6 data plane.

Internet-Draft               PCEP-SRv6-YANG                    July 2020


   [I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-yang] defines a YANG [RFC7950] data model for the
   management of PCEP speakers.  This document contains a specification
   of the PCEP-SRv6 YANG module, "ietf-pcep-srv6" which provides the
   PCEP-SRv6 [I-D.ietf-pce-segment-routing-ipv6] data model.

   The PCEP operational state is included in the same tree as the PCEP
   configuration consistent with Network Management Datastore
   Architecture [RFC8342].  The origin of the data is indicated as per
   the origin metadata annotation.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Terminology and Notation

   This document also uses the following terms defined in [RFC7420]:

   o  PCEP entity: a local PCEP speaker.

   o  PCEP peer: to refer to a remote PCEP speaker.

   o  PCEP speaker: where it is not necessary to distinguish between
      local and remote.

   Further, this document also uses the following terms defined in
   [RFC8231] :

   o  Stateful PCE, Passive Stateful PCE, Active Stateful PCE

   o  Delegation, Revocation, Redelegation

   o  LSP State Report, Path Computation Report message (PCRpt).

   o  LSP State Update, Path Computation Update message (PCUpd).

   [RFC8281] :

   o  PCE-initiated LSP, Path Computation LSP Initiate Message
      (PCInitiate).

   [RFC8408] :

   o  Path Setup Type (PST).

3.1.  Tree Diagrams

   A simplified graphical representation of the data model is used in
   this document.  The meaning of the symbols in these diagrams is
   defined in [RFC8340].

3.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   In this document, names of data nodes and other data model objects
   are often used without a prefix, as long as it is clear from the
   context in which YANG module each name is defined.  Otherwise, names
   are prefixed using the standard prefix associated with the
   corresponding YANG module, as shown in Table 1.

6.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed
   via network management protocol such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is SSH [RFC6242].
   The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is TLS [RFC8446]

   The NETCONF access control model [RFC8341] provides the means to
   restrict access for particular NETCONF or RESTCONF users to a pre-
   configured subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol
   operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in the YANG module which are
   writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is the
   default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or vulnerable
   in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g., <edit-config>)
   to these data nodes without proper protection can have a negative

   effect on network operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes
   and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /pcep:pcep/pcep:entity/pcep:capability/pcep-srv6:srv6 - configure
      local SRv6 capability and parameters.

      /pcep:pcep/pcep:entity/pcep:peers/pcep:peer/pcep:capability/pcep-
      srv6:srv6 - configure peer's SRv6 capability and parameters.

   Unauthorized access to above list can adversely affect the PCEP
   session between the local entity and the peers.  This may lead to
   inability to compute new paths, stateful operations on the delegated
   as well as PCE-initiated LSPs.

   Some of the readable data nodes in this YANG module may be considered
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
   important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config, or
   notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

      /pcep:pcep/pcep:entity/pcep:lsp-db/pcep:lsp/pcep-srv6:srv6 - The
      SRv6 SID in the network.  Unauthorized access to this could
      provide the all path and network usage information.
