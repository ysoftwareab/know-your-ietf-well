                   A PFS-preserving protocol for LURK
                        draft-erb-lurk-rsalg-01

Abstract

   This document defines a protocol between a content provider and an
   external key owner that enables the provider to act as a TLS
   termination end-point for the key owner, without having the key
   actually being provisioned at the provider.

   The protocol between the two preserves forward secrecy, and is also
   designed to prevent the use of the key owner as a general-purpose
   signing oracle which would make it complicit in attacks against uses
   of the very keys it is trying to protect.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Three entities are involved in this protocol, although only two
   actually

   participate in the protocol exchanges:

         Client    <----->    Server    <---->    KeyOwner

   The "KeyOwner" is an entity holding a Certificate and associated
   private Key, typically bound to an identity such as a DNS name.

   The "server" acts on behalf of the KeyOwner, such as terminating TLS
   connections.  From external appearances, such as TLS peer name
   verification, the server is indistinguishable from the KeyOwner.

Internet-Draft            draft-erb-lurk-rsalg                  May 2016


   The "client" is the end-entity that initiates a connection to the
   server.

2.  Goals and Non-Goals

   It is not a goal to protect against an active attacker who can
   decrypt or actively MiTM any of the traffic.

   It is not a goal to protect Client-Server traffic in the event of a
   full compromise of a KeyOwner private key.

   This protocol can support Client-Server communications from SSLv3 up
   through TLS 1.2.  (TLS 1.3 will have to be evaluated at a later
   date.)

   Past Client-Server communications must remain private in the event
   that a Server is compromised (Perfect Forward Secrecy).  For Server
   Key Exchange signing requests, this is not an issue.  For RSA
   decryption requests used by the TLS_RSA_* cipher suites, the "RSALG"
   message exchanges described below provide PFS protection.

   The protocol should not become a generic signing oracle, even if it
   is suboptimal with regard to network bandwidth utilization.  This is
   done by not simply signing values, but by computing the full
   signature hash at the KeyOwner.

3.  Protocol Overview

   Communication between the Server and KeyOwner MUST be over a
   mutually-authenticated TLS connection that uses PFS key exchange.
   TLS 1.2 or later SHOULD be used.

3.1.  Setup

   A Server can contact a KeyOwner at any time to request the state of
   the KeyOwner.  When a Server is notified of a state change in a
   KeyOwner response message, it MUST then request the state of the
   KeyOwner.

3.2.  Server Key Exchange

   A KeyOwner will sign requests on behalf of the Server for the
   signature required for the Server Key Exchange Message.  This message
   includes the client and server random values and key parameters.

3.3.  RSALG

   The basic premise of RSALG is that in the TLS_RSA_* handshakes:

   o  The KeyOwner will not decrypt the PMS and provide it back to the
      Server.  Instead, the KeyOwner will full compute the Master Secret
      (via the PRF function) and provide that.

   o  The Server will choose a random ephemeral value, N, and provide a
      cryptographically-hashed value of (such as SHA256(N)) as its
      Server Random value.  The Server sends N to KeyOwner which then
      computes the same hashed value and uses that hash as its input to
      the PRF.

   An attacker who later gains access to KeyOwner would be unable to
   derive the same Master Secret.  This attacker would be able to see
   the Client Random, Server Random and encrypted PMS, but would be
   unable to replay this to KeyOwner unless they could reverse the
   cryptographic hash function used to compute the server random.

3.3.1.  Implementation Note - Modified Bleichenbacher Attack

   If an attacker can gain access to a Server, they could mount a
   Bleichenbacher attack against it (REF NEEDED).  The standard SSL/TLS
   defense against the Bleichenbacher attack (generating a string of
   random bytes) is not effective here, since an attacker could generate
   two requests with identical inputs and learn information about the
   validity of the padding by seeing whether it gets a consistent output
   in both cases.  This is possible because the attacker also controls
   (the input to) the server random.

   To avoid this variation on the Bleichenbacher attack, KeyOwner should
   compute the HMAC-SHA-384 over the PRF inputs as its "invalid"
   response, using a private key as the hash key, to ensure that the
   output is a deterministic function of the input and cannot be
   calculated by the attacker.  This private key must be globally unique
   per keypair, therefore the RSA private key being used to decrypt the
   PMS is an obvious choice.

   The PRF inputs to the HMAC-SHA-384 described above are the encrypted
   PMS, client version and server version.

3.3.2.  Implementation Note - Hash Calculation

   In TLS 1.2 and earlier, the first four bytes of a server random value
   are actually a timestamp.  An implementation must use those four
   bytes as an input to the hash function as described above, then

Internet-Draft            draft-erb-lurk-rsalg                  May 2016


   overwrite them as input to the PRF calculated by the KeyOwner and the
   Server Random value provided to the Client.

   Example:

       server_random = N
       server_random[0..3] = get_time()

   Server communicates server_random to KeyOwner

   Both Server and KeyOwner compute the following:

       saved_time = server_random[0..3]
       server_random = sha256(server_random)
       server_random[0..3] = saved_time

3.4.  Session Ticket Key Request

   A Server that supports TLS session tickets for multiple KeyOwners
   SHOULD ensure that the ticket encryption keys are secure in the face
   of various compromises.  Using a hash of the private key as one of
   the inputs to the session ticket KDF ensures that the traffic for
   KeyOwner is protected against compromise of, or malicious behavior
   by, other input parts to the session ticket KDF.  It also limits the
   extent to which compromise of a particular session ticket key effects
   the Server acting on behalf of multiple KeyOwners.

   After receiving a request, the KeyOwner computes an HMAC over a
   server-supplied salt and a fixed string using the private key for the
   certificate specified in the request as the hash key.

   The fixed string is set by the KeyOwner, for example "LURK SESSION
   TICKET".

       session_ticket_secret = HMAC-SHA-384(private_key,
                                            server_salt + fixed_string)

4.  LURK Message Formats

   The formats below are described using the TLS Presentation Language.

   The following message header appears at the start of every message:

      algorithms that the KeyOwner supports (see RFC5246, section
      7.4.1.4.1).  TODO: TLSv1.3 considerations

   certificate_list  A list of certificate that are supported by the
      KeyOwner.  The purpose field is a value that MUST be pre-
      configured by the Server and KeyOwner so a Server can have context
      of where to use the corresponding ASN.1Cert.  An example pre-
      configuration of the purpose field is: purpose = sha256(hostname)

   state  A hash of the current state of the server.  A KeyOwner MUST
      provide this value in every response message and MUST update the
      value to let a Server know to send a setup_request message.  This
      value MUST be consistant across multiple KeyOwners with identical
      configurations.  An example of this value: state =
      sha256(supported_signature_algorithms + certificate_list)

4.4.  Session Ticket Request

   A session ticket key input request message looks like this:

       struct {
           lurk_msg_header  header;
           uint64           id;
           uint8            cert<32>;
           uint8            server_salt<48>;
       } lurk_session_ticket_request;

   id A unique identifier to allow pipelining and match requests and
      responses.

   cert  The identifier for the keypair to be used in this request.
      This SHOULD be the SHA256 value of the public key.

   server_salt  A server supplied random salt.

4.5.  Response Message

   A response message, used by both request types, looks like this:

       enum {
           success(0), invalidParameters(1), certUnavailable(2),
           permissionDenied(3), insufficentResources(4), (255)
       } ResponseStatus

           opaque           data<0..2^16-1>;
       } lurk_response;

   id The request id for which this is the response.

   state  A 32 byte tag identifying the current state of the server.
      This is expected to be the same value found in the setup_response
      message.  If this value is different the Server MUST send a
      setup_request message.

   data  For any status other than success, the data is ignored and MUST
      be NULL.  For rsalg requests, the data contains the master secret.
      For server_kx requests, the data contains the signed hash.  For
      session ticket key requests, the data contains the computed HMAC.

5.  Open Issues

   The KeyOwner could choose the TLS server random.  This makes RSALG
   even less likely to be useful as an oracle, but has turned out to be
   difficult to integrate into existing TLS/SSL libraries.

   Should the lurk_request and lurk_response messages be padded out to
   eight-byte alignment?

   Should we use variant for the different request/response payloads?
