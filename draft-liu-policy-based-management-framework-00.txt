                 SUPA Policy-based Management Framework
             draft-liu-policy-based-management-framework-00

Abstract

   Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions (SUPA) defines base YANG data
   models to encode policy, which point to device-, technology-, and
   service-specific YANG models developed elsewhere.  Policy rules
   within an operator's environment can be used to express high-level,
   possibly network-wide policies to a network management function
   (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a network element).  The
   network management function can then control the configuration and/or
   monitoring of network elements and services.  This document describes
   the SUPA basic framework, its elements and interfaces.

1.  Introduction

   Traffic flows over increasingly complex enterprise and service
   provider networks become more and more important.  Meanwhile, the
   rapid growth of the variety makes the task of network operations and
   management applications deploying new services much more difficult.
   Moreover, network operators want to deploy new services quickly and
   efficiently.  Two possible mechanisms for dealing with this growing
   difficulty are the use of software abstractions to simplify the
   design and configuration of monitoring and control operations, and
   the use of programmatic control over the configuration and operation
   of such networks.  Policy-based management can be used to combine
   these two mechanisms into an extensible framework.

Internet-Draft   SUPA Policy-based Management Framework   September 2017


   Policy rules within an operator's environment are a set of rules that
   define how services are designed, delivered, and operated.  The SUPA
   (Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions) data model represents high-
   level, possibly network-wide policy, which can be input to a network
   management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a
   network element).The network management function can then control the
   configuration and/or monitoring of network elements and services
   according to such policies.

   SUPA defines a generic policy information model (GPIM) [I-D.ietf-
   supa-generic-policy-info-model] for use in network operations and
   management applications.  The GPIM defines concepts and terminology
   needed by policy management independent of the form and content of
   the policy rule.  The Event-Condition-Action (ECA) Policy Rule
   Information Model (EPRIM) [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policyinfo-model]
   extends the GPIM by defining how to build policy rules according to
   the event-condition-action paradigm.

   Both the GPIM and the EPRIM are targeted at controlling the
   configuration and monitoring of network elements throughout the
   service development and deployment lifecycle.  The GPIM and the EPRIM
   can both be translated into corresponding YANG [RFC6020][RFC6020bis]
   modules that define policy concepts, terminology, and rules in a
   generic and interoperable manner; additional YANG modules may also be
   derived from the GPIM and/or EPRIM to manage specific functions.

   The key benefit of policy management is that it enables different
   network elements and services to be instructed to behave the same
   way, even if they are programmed differently.  Management
   applications will benefit from using policy rules that enable
   scalable and consistent programmatic control over the configuration
   and monitoring of network elements and services.

   Some typical and useful instances, for authors to understand the
   applicability of SUPA, such as SNMP blocking upon load of link
   reaching a threshold, virtual maching migration upon the changinng of
   user location, are written in [I-D.cheng-supa-applicability].

2.  Terminology

   SUPA: Simplified Use of Policy Abstractions, is the working group
   name, which defines a data model, to be used to represent high-level,
   possibly network-wide policies, which can be input to a network
   management function (within a controller, an orchestrator, or a
   network element).

   YANG: an acronym for "Yet Another Next Generation".  YANG is a data
   modeling language used to model configuration and state data

   manipulated by the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), NETCONF
   remote procedure calls, and NETCONF notifications.[RFC6020]

   ECA: Event-Condition-Action, is a short-cut for referring to the
   structure of active rules in event driven architecture and active
   database systems.

   EMS: Element Management System, software to monitor and control
   network elements (devices) in telecommunications.

   NMS: Network Management System, a set of hardware and/or software
   tools that allow an IT professional to supervise the individual
   components of a network within a larger network management framework.

   OSS: Operations/Operational Support System, are computer systems used
   by telecommunications service providers to manage their networks
   (e.g., telephone networks).

   BSS: Business Support Systems, are used to support various end-to-end
   telecommunication services.

   GPIM: Generic Policy Information Model, which defines concepts and
   terminology needed by policy management independent of the form and
   content of the policy rule.

   EPRIM: ECA Policy Rule Information Model, which extends the GPIM by
   defining how to build policy rules according to the event-condition-
   action paradigm.

   GPDM: Generic Policy Data Models [I-D.ietf-supa-generic-policy-data-
   model], are created from the GPIM.  These YANG data model policies
   are used to control the configuration of network elements that model
   the service(s) to be managed.  The relationship of information model
   (IM) and DM can be founded in [RFC3444].

   Declarative Policy: policies that specify the goals to be achieved
   but not how to achieve those goals (also called "intent-based"
   policies).  Please note that declarative policies are out of scope
   for the initial phase of SUPA.

3.  Framework for Generic Policy-based Management

   This section briefly describes the design and operation of the SUPA
   policy-based management framework.

Internet-Draft   SUPA Policy-based Management Framework   September 2017


3.1.  Overview

   Figure 1 shows a simplified functional architecture of how SUPA is
   used to define policies for creating network element configuration
   snippets.  (Note from Editor: a "snippet" is a small piece of
   information (e.g., part of a sentence that was cut out).)  SUPA uses
   the GPIM to define a consensual vocabulary that different actors can
   use to interact with network elements and services.  The EPRIM
   defines a generic structure for imperative policies.  The GPIM, and/
   or the combination of the GPIM and the EPRIM, is converted to generic
   YANG data modules.

   In one possible approach (shown with asterisks in Figure 1), SUPA
   Generic Policy and SUPA ECA Policy YANG data modules together with
   the Resource and Service YANG data models specified in IETF (which
   define the specific elements that will be controlled by policies) are
   used by the Service Interface Logic.  This Service Interface Logic
   creates appropriate input mechanisms for the operator to define
   policies (e.g., a web form or a script) for creating and managing the
   network configuration.  The operator interacts with the interface,
   the policies input by operators are then translated to configuration
   snippets.

   Note that the Resource and Service YANG models may not exist.  In
   this case, the SUPA generic policy YANG data modules serve as an
   extensible basis to develop new YANG data models for the Service
   Interface Logic This transfers the work specified by the Resource and
   Service YANG data models specified in IETF into the Service Interface
   Logic.

                         Figure 1: SUPA Framework

   Figure 1 is exemplary.  The Operator actor can interact with SUPA in
   other ways not shown in Figure 1.  In addition, other actors (e.g.,
   an application developer) that can interact with SUPA are not shown
   for simplicity.

   The EPRIM defines an ECA policy as an example of imperative policies.
   An ECA policy rule is activated when its event clause is true; the
   condition clause is then evaluated and, if true, signals the
   execution of one or more actions in the action clause.  This type of
   policy explicitly defines the current and desired states of the
   system being managed.  Imperative policy rules require additional
   management functions, which are explained in section 3.2 below.

   Figure 2 shows how the SUPA Policy Model is used to create policy
   data models step by step and how the policy rules are used to

   communicate among various network management functions located on
   different layers.

   The Generic Policy Information Model (GPIM) is used to construct
   policies.  The GPIM defines generic policy concepts, as well as two
   types of policies: ECA policy rules and declarative policy
   statements.

   A set of Generic Policy Data Models (GPDM) are then created from the
   GPIM.  These YANG data model policies are then used to control the
   configuration of network elements that model the service(s) to be
   managed.

   Resource and Service YANG Data Models: models of the service as well
   as physical and virtual network topology including the resource
   attributes (e.g., data rate or latency of links) and operational
   parameters needed to support service deployment over the network
   topology.

      The arrow with Ds means derived from.

   The components within this framework are:

   SUPA Policy Model: represents one or more policy modules that contain
   the following entities:

   Generic Policy Information Model: a model for defining policy rules
   that are independent of data repository, data definition, query,
   implementation languages, and protocol.  This model is abstract and
   is used for design; it MUST be turned into a data model for
   implementation.

   Generic Policy Data Model: a model of policy rules that are dependent
   on data repository, data definition, query, implementation languages,
   and protocol.

   ECA Policy Rule Information Model (EPRIM): represents a policy rule
   as a statement that consists of an event clause, a condition clause,
   and an action clause.  This type of Policy Rule explicitly defines
   the current and desired states of the system being managed.  This
   model is abstract and is used for design; it MUST be turned into a
   data model for implementation.

   ECA Policy Rule Data Model: a model of policy rules, derived from
   EPRIM, while each policy rule consists of an event clause, a
   condition clause, and an action clause.

   EMS/NMS/Controller: represents one or more entities that are able to
   control the operation and management of a network infrastructure
   (e.g., a network topology that consists of Network Elements).

   Network Element (NE), which can interact with local or remote
   EMS/NMS/Controller in order to exchange information, such as
   configuration information, policy enforcement capabilities, and
   network status.

   Relationship between Policy, Service and Resource models can be
   illustrated by the figure below.

   Policies are used to control the management of resources and
   services, while data from resources and services are used to select
   and/or modify policies during runtime.  More importantly, policies
   can be used to manage how resources are allocated and assigned to
   services.  This enables a single policy to manage one or multiple
   services and resources as well as their dependencies. (1:1..n) in (1)
   and (2) below figure 3 show one policy rule is able to manages and
   can adjust one or multiple services/resources.  Line (1) and (2)
   connecting policy to resource and policy to service are the same, and
   line (3) connecting resource to service is different as it's
   navigable only from resource to service.

3.2.  Operation

   SUPA can be used to define various types of policies, including
   policies that affect services and/or the configuration of individual
   or groups of network elements.  SUPA can be used by a centralized

   and/or distributed set of entities for creating, managing,
   interacting with, and retiring policy rules.

   The SUPA scope is limited to policy information and data models.
   SUPA does not define network resource data models or network service
   data models; both are out of scope.  Instead, SUPA makes use of
   network resource data models defined by other WGs or SDOs.

   Declarative policies are out of scope for the initial phase of SUPA.

3.3.  The GPIM and the EPRIM

   The GPIM provides a common vocabulary for representing concepts that
   are common to different types of policy, but which are independent of
   language, protocol, repository, and level of abstraction.  Hence, the
   GPIM defines concepts and vocabulary needed by policy management
   systems independent of the form and content of the policy.  The EPRIM
   is a more specific model that refines the GPIM to specify policy
   rules in an event-condition-action form.

   This enables different policies at different levels of abstraction to
   form a continuum, where more abstract policies can be translated into
   more concrete policies, and vice-versa.  For example, the information
   model can be extended by generalizing concepts from an existing data
   model into the GPIM; the GPIM extensions can then be used by other
   data models.

3.4.  Creation of Generic YANG Modules

   An information model is abstract.  As such, it cannot be directly
   instantiated (i.e., objects cannot be created directly from it).
   Therefore, both the GPIM and the combination of the GPIM and the
   EPRIM, are translated to generic YANG modules.

   SUPA will provide guidelines for translating the GPIM (or the
   combination of the GPIM and the EPRIM) into concrete YANG data models
   that define how to manage and communicate policies between systems.
   Multiple imperative policy YANG data models may be instantiated from
   the GPIM (or the combination of the GPIM and the EPRIM).  In
   particular, SUPA will specify a set of YANG data models that will
   consist of a base policy model for representing policy management
   concepts independent of the type or structure of a policy, and as
   well, an extension for defining policy rules according to the ECA
   paradigm.(Note from Editor: This means that policies can be defined
   using the GPIM directly, or using the combination of the GPIM and the
   EPRIM.  If you use only the GPIM, you get a technology- and vendor-
   independent information model that you are free to map to the data
   model of your choice; note that the structure of a policy is NOT

   defined.  If you use the GPIM and the EPRIM, you get a technology-
   and vendor-independent information model that defines policies as an
   event-condition-action (i.e., imperative) rule.)

   The process of developing the GPIM, EPRIM and the derived/translated
   YANG data models is realized following the sequence shown below.
   After completing this process and if the implementation of the YANG
   data models requires it, the GPIM and EPRIM and the derived/
   translated YANG data models are updated and synchronized.

   (1)=>(2)=>(3)=>(4)=>(3')=>(2')=>(1')

   Where, (1)=GPIM; (2)=EPRIM; (3)=YANG data models; (4)=
   Implementation; (3')= update of YANG data models; (2')=update of
   EPRIM; (1') = update of GPIM

   The YANG module derived from the GPIM contains concepts and
   terminology for the common operation and administration of policy-
   based systems, as well as an extensible structure for policy rules of
   different paradigms.  The YANG module derived from the EPRIM extends
   the generic nature of the GPIM by representing policies using an
   event-condition-action structure.

   The above sequence allows for the addition of new, as well as the
   editing of existing model elements in the GPIM and EPRIM.  In
   practice, the implementation sequence may be much simpler.
   Specifically, it is unlikely that the GPIM will need to be changed.
   In addition, changes to the EPRIM will likely be focused on fine-
   tuning the behavior offered by a specific set of model elements.

4.  Security Considerations

   This informational document presents the framework and workflow of
   SUPA, as well as an explanation on the relationship of policy,
   service and resources.  This document does not introduce any new
   security issues, and the framework has no security impact on the
   Internet.  The same considerations are relevant as those for the base
   NETCONF protocol (see Section 9 in [RFC6241]).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no actions for IANA.
