 Registry Lock Extension for the Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP)
                      draft-wisser-registrylock-04

Abstract

   This extensions defines an additional protective layer for changes to
   domain [RFC5731], host [RFC5732] and contact [RFC5733] objects
   managed through EPP.

   EPP allows changes to objects only by the sponsoring client.  EPP
   objects are usually managed by the sponsoring client on behalf of the
   sponsoring clients customers.  All of these interactions are ususally
   fully automated.

   In case of a system breach, there is no protection in EPP to changes
   to any object by the intruder.

   This extension defines a protective layer that aims to break
   automated changes and work flows by requiring manual intervention.

   The actual form of manual intervention is out-of-scope for this
   document.  By whom and how changes can be made is up to the registry
   and registrars to decide.

1.  Introduction

   This extensions defines an additional protective layer for changes to
   domain [RFC5731], host [RFC5732] and contact [RFC5733] objects
   managed through EPP.

   EPP allows changes to objects only by the sponsoring client.  EPP
   objects are usually managed by the sponsoring client on behalf of the
   sponsoring clients customers.  All of these interactions are ususally
   fully automated.

   In case of a system breach, there is no protection in EPP to changes
   to any object by the intruder.

   This extension defines a protective layer that aims to break
   automated changes and work flows by requiring manual intervention.

   The actual form of manual intervention is out-of-scope for this
   document.  By whom and how changes can be made is up to the registry
   and registrars to decide.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this protocol.

   "regLock" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:registryLock-1.0".  The XML namespace
   prefix "reglock" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it
   and instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer
   to interpret and output the XML documents.

2.  Object Protection

   This extension provides additional protection to objects managed by a
   sponsoring client on behalf of a registrant.  This is achieved by
   requiring additional authorization for transform commands.

   Solutions can be broadly categorized as in-band or out-of-band
   authorizations.  Where in-band authorizations would provide
   authorization through EPP.  Whereas out-of-band solutions provide
   authorization by some other means.

   *  either by temporarily unlocking the object for changes
   *  or by authorizing pending changes after they have been submitted
      to the server

2.1.  Out-of-band Authorization

   Out-of-band Authorization is not covered in this document.  By
   definition out-of-band authorization will not use EPP and therefore
   is not subject of consideration here.

   Registries must provide means for the registrar or registrant to
   temporarily unlock the domain, to remove registry lock or ro
   authorize changes submitted to the server through some means than
   EPP.

2.2.  In-band Authorization

   Currently defined authorization schemes are not deemed secure enough
   for in-band change authorization.  Therefore this document does not
   allow in-band authorization.  This is left as a future development
   once secure enough authorization schemes have been defined.

   The current defined authorization scheme is based on static
   passwords.  This would mean that once a password is known any change
   can be made.  Security here is once again dependend on the security
   of all automatic systems invloved.

2.3.  Command Execution Restrictions

   Once an object has Registry Lock enabled all transform commands
   except <renew> MUST only be executed if a proper authorization has
   been made.

   Otherwise the command MUST be rejected with EPP result code 2201
   "Authorization error" or 1001 "Command completed successfully; action
   pending" [RFC5730] section 3 in depending on the chosen out-of-band
   authorization.

Internet-Draft                registryLock                     July 2021


   if the server has returned a 1001 "Command completed successfully;
   action pending" answer, it MUST follow [RFC5731], [RFC5732],
   [RFC5733] in handling succeeded or failed commands.

   The following EPP flags must be set.

   *  serverDeleteProhibited
   *  serverTransferProhibited
   *  serverUpdateProhibited

   If the object is unlocked the flags SHOULD be cleared and the server
   should answer to an <info> request with the according information.

   OPEN QUESTION: If a domain is under registry lock, can a subordinate
   host be updated?

   *  I got one "no" answer - hosts might not be owned by domain owner
   *  In .se/.nu all subordinary hosts are automatically owned by the
      domain owner and locked if the domain is locked.

   We need more input!

   If the object is temporarily unlocked only <update> commands are
   allowed.  <delete> and <transfer> are explicitly not allowed.  For
   the time of the temporary unlock the serverUpdateProhibited status
   should be cleared.

2.4.  Temporary Unlock

   While an object is locked some situations could require a change.  To
   fully unlock the object would remove all protection and could not
   provide any guarantee that the object is protected again after the
   desired changes have been made.

   Temporarily unlocking the object allows for a more fine grained
   security model for all objects.

   Any temporary unlocking of the object has to be time limited.  After
   that time has passed no further changes are possible.

   Additionally the number of allowed EPP commands can be specified to
   further limit the changes possible.

   Registries and registrars can further limit the possibles changes,
   e.g. not allowing owner changes even for temporarily unlocked Domain
   objects.

   IS THE LAST PARAGRAPH A GOOD IDEA?  INPUT NEEDED!!!

Internet-Draft                registryLock                     July 2021


   When an object is temporarily unlocked the serverUpdateProhibited
   SHOULD be cleared while changes are possible.

   When either the time for the temporary unlock has passed or the
   maximum amount of EPP changes has been made the object MUST return to
   a fully locked status.  The serverUpdateProhibited flag MUST be set
   again and the infData response MUST no longer contain a
   <unlockedUntil> element.

3.  Object Attributes

3.1.  Locking Status

   Locking Status information indicates if the additional protection of
   Registry Lock is enabled for an object.

   Boolean values MUST be represented in the XML Schema format described
   in Part 2 of the W3C XML Schema recommendation
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

4.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].

4.1.  EPP Query Commands

4.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <check> command
   or <check> response described in the EPP mappings [RFC5731],
   [RFC5732] or [RFC5733].

4.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP domain mapping [RFC5731], host mapping [RFC5732]
   or contact mapping [RFC5733] However, additional elements are defined
   for the <info> response.

   When an <info> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <resData> element MUST contain child elements as described in the EPP
   object mappings.

   In addition, the EPP <extension> element SHOULD contain a child
   <regLock:infData> element that identifies the extension namespace the
   epp client has indicated support for the extension in the <login>
   command.

Internet-Draft                registryLock                     July 2021


   The <regLock:infData> element contains the following child elements:

   *  Exactly one <locked> element that indicates if Registry Lock is
      enabled for the object.
   *  An OPTIONAL <unlockedUntil> element if the object currently can be
      changed by the sponsoring client.  The field indicates the time
      stamp when the lock will become active again.
   *  An OPTIONAL <eppCmdCount> attribute that indicates the number of
      EPP <update> commands that will be executed.

4.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP mapping
   [RFC5731], [RFC5732] or [RFC5733].

4.2.  EPP Transform Commands

4.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension is intended to be used within the scope of the object
   creation.  It does not define a <create> command of its own.

   This extension adds elements to the EPP <create> command as described
   in the EPP [RFC5730].

   When submitting a <create> command to the server, the client MAY
   include in the <extension> element a <registryLock:lock> element to
   create the domain in a locked state.  The extension includes the
   following element:

   *  A <regLock:lock> element indicating that the domain MUST be
      created in a locked state.

   When a <create> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   response is as described in the EPP objects mappings [RFC5731],
   [RFC5732], [RFC5733].

   Example <host:create> command

C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>

4.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <delete> command
   or <delete> response described in the EPP mappings [RFC5731],
   [RFC5732] or [RFC5733].

   If the object is locked, the EPP <delete> command MUST be rejected
   with EPP response code 2201 "Authorization error" [RFC5730] section
   3.  See Section 2.3

4.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <renew> command
   or <renew> response described in the EPP mappings [RFC5731],
   [RFC5732] or [RFC5733].

   Execution of the EPP <renew> command is not restricted by this
   extension.

4.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP mappings
   [RFC5731], [RFC5732] or [RFC5733].

   If the object is locked, the EPP <transfer> command MUST be rejected
   with EPP response code 2201 "Authorization error" [RFC5730] section
   3.  See Section 2.3

4.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension adds elements to the EPP <update> command as described
   in [RFC5730].

   If the object is not locked, the <update> command can be used to lock
   the object, similarly to the <create> command.

   If the object is in locked state, but temporarily unlocked, the
   server MUST execute the command as if the object were unlocked.

   If the object is locked the server can handle <update> commands in
   two ways

   *  answering the command with EPP response code 1001 "Command
      completed successfully; action pending" [RFC5730] section 3
   *  rejecting with EPP response code 2201 "Authorization error"
      [RFC5730] section 3

   Registries can narrow down allowed changes when a domain is locked.
   Registries could prohobit changes of registrant for doamins even if
   the domain is temporatily unlocked or password authorization is
   given.

   When a <update> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   response is as described in the EPP objects mappings [RFC5731],

5.  Formal Syntax

   One schema is presented here that is the EPP Registry Lock Extension
   schema.

   The formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   of the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  XML Namespace

   This document uses URNs to describe XML namespaces and XML schemas
   conforming to a registry mechanism described in [RFC3688].  The
   following URI assignment is requested of IANA:

Internet-Draft                registryLock                     July 2021


   Registration request for the registryLock namespace:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp:registryLock-1.0
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: None.  Namespace URIs do not represent an XML specification.

   Registration request for the registryLock XML schema:

      URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:schema:epp:registryLock-1.0
      Registrant Contact: IESG
      XML: See the "Formal Syntax" section of this document.

6.2.  EPP Extension Registry

   The EPP extension described in this document should be registered by
   the IANA in the EPP Extension Registry described in [RFC7451].  The
   details of the registration are as follows:

   Name of Extension: "Registry Lock Extension for the Extensible
   Provisioning Protocol (EPP)"

   Document status: Standards Track

   Reference: (insert reference to RFC version of this document)

   Registrant Name and Email Address: IESG, <iesg@ietf.org>

   TLDs: Any

   IPR Disclosure: None

   Status: Active

   Notes: None

7.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section and the reference to
   RFC 7942 [RFC7942] before publication.

   Implemented by .SE since 2019.

8.  Security Considerations

   The security properties of EPP from [RFC5730] are preserved.

   This extensions introduces an additional security layer for changes
   of objects managed through EPP.  The overall security of these
   measures depends on the security of the out-of-band authorization.
   Registries and registrars are therefore adviced to select secure
   forms of authorization.

   Current EPP authorizations schemes are not secure enough to allow in-
   band authorization.  Registries and registrars therefore MUST not
   implent in-band command authorization.
