1. Introduction

   [IS-IS] specifies the IS-IS protocol (ISO 10589) with extensions to 
   support IPv4 in [IS-IS-IP]. A router advertises one or several Link 
   State Protocol data units which are composed of variable length 
   tuples called TLVs (Type-Length-Value).

   [IS-IS-TE] defines a set of new TLVs whose aims are to add more 
   information about links characteristics, increase the range of IS-IS 
   metrics and optimize the encoding of IS-IS prefixes. 

   This document defines a new sub-TLV named "Link-attributes" carried 
   within the extended IS reachability TLV (type 22) specified in 
   [IS-IS-TE].

2. Link-attributes sub-TLV format

   The link-attribute sub-TLV is carried within the TLV 22 and has a 
   format identical to the sub-TLV format used by the Traffic 
   Engineering Extensions for IS-IS [IS-IS-TE]: 1 octet of sub-type, 1 
   octet of length of the value field of the sub-TLV followed by the 
   value field, in this case, a 16 bit flags field.

   The Link-attribute sub-type is 19 (to be assigned by IANA) and has a 
   length of 2 octets.

   This sub-TLV is OPTIONAL and MAY appear at most once for a single IS 
   neighbor. If a received LSP contains more than one Link-Attribute 
   Sub-TLV, an implementation MAY decide to consider only the first 
   encountered instance.

   The following bits are defined:
   
   Local Protection Available (0x01). When set, this indicates that the 
   link is protected by means of some local protection mechanism (e.g 
   [FRR]).

   Link excluded from local protection path (0x02). When set, this link 
   SHOULD not be included in any computation of a repair path by any 
   other router in the routing area. The triggers for setting up this 
   bit are out of the scope of this document.

3. Interoperability with routers non supporting this capability

   A router not supporting the link-attribute sub-TLV MUST just 
   silently ignore this sub-TLV.

4. Security considerations

   No new security issues are raised in this document.

5. IANA considerations

   IANA will assign a new codepoint for the link-attribute sub-TLV 
   defined in this document and carried within TLV 22. Suggested value 
   is 19 (to be assigned by IANA).

6. Intellectual Property Considerations

   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any
   Intellectual Property Rights or other rights that might be claimed 
   to pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described 
   in this document or the extent to which any license under such 
   rights might or might not be available; nor does it represent that 
   it has made any independent effort to identify any such rights. 
   Information on the procedures with respect to rights in RFC 
   documents can be found in BCP 78 and BCP 79.

   Copies of IPR disclosures made to the IETF Secretariat and any 
   assurances of licenses to be made available, or the result of an 
   attempt made to obtain a general license or permission for the use 
   of such proprietary rights by implementers or users of this 
   specification can be obtained from the IETF on-line IPR repository 
   at http://www.ietf.org/ipr.

   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
   rights that may cover technology that may be required to implement
