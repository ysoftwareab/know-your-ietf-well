            Packet loss resiliency for Router Solicitations
                    draft-ietf-6man-resilient-rs-06

Abstract

   When an interface on a host is initialized, the host transmits Router
   Solicitations in order to minimize the amount of time it needs to
   wait until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is
   received.  In certain scenarios, these router solicitations
   transmitted by the host might be lost.  This document specifies a
   mechanism for hosts to cope with the loss of the initial Router
   Solicitations.

1.  Introduction

   As specified in [RFC4861], when an interface on a host is
   initialized, in order to obtain Router Advertisements quickly, a host
   transmits up to MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS (3) Router Solicitation
   messages, each separated by at least RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL (4)
   seconds.  In certain scenarios, these router solicitations
   transmitted by the host might be lost. e.g. The host is connected to
   a bridged residential gateway over Ethernet or WiFi.  LAN
   connectivity is achieved at interface initialization, but the
   upstream WAN connectivity is not active yet.  In this case, the host
   just gives up after the initial RS retransmits.

   Once the initial RSs are lost, the host gives up and assumes that
   there are no routers on the link as specified in Section 6.3.7 of
   [RFC4861].  The host will not have any form of Internet connectivity
   until the next unsolicited multicast Router Advertisement is
   received.  These Router Advertisements are transmitted at most
   MaxRtrAdvInterval seconds apart (maximum value 1800 seconds).  Thus
   in the worst case scenario a host would be without any connectivity
   for 30 minutes.  This delay may be unacceptable in some scenarios.

2.  Proposed algorithm

   To achieve resiliency to packet loss, the host needs to continue
   retransmitting the Router Solicitations until it receives a Router
   Advertisement, or until it is willing to accept that no router
   exists.  If the host continues retransmitting the RSs at
   RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL second intervals, it may cause excessive
   network traffic if a large number of such hosts exists.  To achieve
   resiliency while keeping the aggregate network traffic low, the host
   can use some form of exponential backoff algorithm to retransmit the
   RSs.

   Hosts complying to this specification MUST use the exponential
   backoff algorithm for retransmits that is described in Section 14 of
   [RFC3315] in order to continuously retransmit the Router
   Solicitations until a Router Advertisement is received.  The hosts
   SHOULD use the following variables as input to the retransmission
   algorithm:

     IRT  4 seconds

     MRT  3600 seconds

     MRC  0

     MRD  0

   The initial value IRT was chosen to be in line with the current
   retransmission interval (RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL) that is specified
   by [RFC4861] and the maximum retransmission time MRT was chosen to be
   in line with the new value of SOL_MAX_RT as specified by [RFC7083].
   This is to ensure that the short term behavior of the RSs is similar
   to what is experienced in current networks, and longer term
   persistent retransmission behavior trends towards being similar to
   that of DHCPv6 [RFC3315] [RFC7083].

2.1.  Stopping the retransmissions

   On multicast-capable links, the hosts following this specification
   SHOULD stop retransmitting the RSs when Router Discovery is
   successful (i.e. an RA with a non-zero Router Lifetime that results
   in a default route is received).  If an RA is recieved from a router
   and it does not result in a default route (i.e. Router Lifetime is
   zero) the host MUST continue retransmitting the RSs.

   On non-multicast links, the hosts following this specification MUST
   continue retransmitting the RSs even after an RA that results in a
   default route is received.  This is required because, in such links,

   sending an RA can only be triggered by an RS.  Please note that such
   links have special mechanisms for sending RSes as well. e.g. The
   mechanism specified in Section 8.3.4. of ISATAP [RFC5214] unicasts
   the RSes to specific routers.

3.  Configuring the use of retransmissions

   Implementations of this specification are encouraged to provide a
   configuration option to enable or disable potentially infinite RS
   retransmissions.  If a configuration option is provided, it MUST
   enable RS retransmissions by default.  Providing an option to enable/
   disable retransmissions on a per-interface basis allows network
   operators to configure RS behavior most applicable to each connected
   link.

4.  Known Limitations

   When an IPv6-capable host attaches to a network that does not have
   IPv6 enabled, it transmits 3 (MAX_RTR_SOLICITATIONS) Router
   Solicitations as specified in [RFC4861].  If it receives no Router
   Advertisements, it assumes that there are no routers present on the
   link and it ceases to send further RSs.  With the mechanism specified
   in this document, the host will continue to retransmit RSs
   indefinitely at the rate of approximately 1 RS per hour.  It is
   unclear how to differentiate between such a network with no IPv6
   routers and a link where an IPv6 router is temporarily unreachable
   but could become reachable in the future.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document does not require any IANA actions.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document does not present any additional security issues beyond
   those discussed in [RFC4861] and those RFCs that update [RFC4861].
