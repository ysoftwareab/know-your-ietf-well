Abstract

   RFC3261 currently specifies 3DES as the required minimum ciphersuite
   for implementations of S/MIME in SIP.  This document updates the
   normative guidance of RFC3261 to require the Advanced Encryption
   Standard (AES) for S/MIME.

Internet-Draft       S/MIME AES Requirement for SIP        February 2003


1. Introduction

   The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) specification (RFC3261 [1])
   currently details optional support (a normative MAY) for the use of
   secure MIME, or S/MIME (RFC2633 [8]).  Since RFC3261 was published,
   the S/MIME specification and the underlying Cryptographic Message
   Syntax (CMS, RFC3369 [3]) have undergone some revision.  Ongoing work
   has identified AES as a algorithm that might be used for content
   encryption in S/MIME.

   The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES [6]) is widely believed to be
   faster than Triple-DES (3DES, which has previously been mandated for
   usage with S/MIME) and to be comparably secure.  AES is also believed
   to have comparatively low memory requirements, which make it suitable
   for use in mobile or embedded devices, an important use-case for SIP.

   As an additional consideration, the SIP specification has a
   recommendation (normative SHOULD) for support of Transport Layer
   Security (TLS, RFC2246 [7]).  TLS support in SIP requires the usage
   of AES.  That means that currently, implementations that support both
   TLS and S/MIME must support both 3DES and AES.  A similar duplication
   of effort exists with DSS in S/MIME as a digital signature algorithm
   (the mandatory TLS ciphersuite used by SIP requires RSA).  Unifying
   the ciphersuite and signature algorithm requirements for TLS and S/
   MIME would simplify security implementations.

   It is therefore desirable to bring the S/MIME requirement for SIP
   into parity with ongoing work on the S/MIME standard, as well as to
   unify the algorithm requirements for TLS and S/MIME.  To date, S/MIME
   has not yet seen widespread deployment in SIP user agents, and
   therefore the minimum ciphersuite for S/MIME could be updated without
   obsoleting any substantial deployments of S/MIME for SIP (in fact,
   these changes will probably make support for S/MIME easier).  This
   document therefore updates the normative requirements for S/MIME in
   RFC3261.

   Note that work on these revisions in the S/MIME working group is
   still in progress.  This document will continue to track that work as
   it evolves.  By initiating this process in the SIP WG now, we provide
   an early opportunity for input into the proposed changes and give
   implementers some warning that the S/MIME requirements for SIP are
   potentially changing.

2. Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
   RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as

   described in RFC2119 [2] and indicate requirement levels for
   compliant SIP implementations.

3. S/MIME Ciphersuite Requirements for SIP

   The following updates the text of RFC3261 Section 23.3, specifically
   the fifth bullet point.  The text currently reads:

         o  S/MIME implementations MUST at a minimum support SHA1 as a
            digital signature algorithm, and 3DES as an encryption
            algorithm.  All other signature and encryption algorithms MAY
            be supported.  Implementations can negotiate support for these
            algorithms with the "SMIMECapabilities" attribute.

   This text is updated with the following:

   S/MIME implementations MUST at a minimum support RSA as a digital
   signature algorithm, SHA1 as a digest algorithm, and AES as an
   encryption algorithm (as specified in [4].  For key wrap, S/MIME
   implementations MUST support the AES Key Wrap Algorithm ([5]).  S/
   MIME implementations of AES MUST support 128-bit AES keys, and SHOULD
   support 192 and 256-bit keys.  Note that the S/MIME specification [8]
   mandates support for 3DES as an encryption algorithm, DH for key
   encryption and DSS as a signature algorithm.  In the SIP profile of
   S/MIME, support for 3DES, DH and DSS is RECOMMENDED but not required.
   All other signature and encryption algorithms MAY be supported.
   Implementations can negotiate support for algorithms with the
   "SMIMECapabilities" attribute.

   Transfer encoding used in S/MIME for SIP MUST use DER (Distinguished
   Encoding Rules), not the Basic ASN.1 Encoding Rules.

4. Security Considerations

   The migration of the S/MIME requirement from Triples-DES to AES is
   not known to introduce any new security considerations.

5. IANA Considerations

   This document introduces no considerations for IANA.
