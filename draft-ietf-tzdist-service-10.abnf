start=<date-time>  OPTIONAL, and MUST NOT occur more than once.
         Specifies the inclusive UTC date-time value at which the
         returned time zone data is truncated at its start.

end=<date-time>  OPTIONAL, and MUST NOT occur more than once.
         Specifies the exclusive UTC date-time value at which the
         returned time zone data is truncated at its end.

start=<date-time>:  REQUIRED, and MUST occur only once.  Specifies
         the inclusive UTC date-time value for the start of the period
         of interest.

end=<date-time>:  REQUIRED, and MUST occur only once.  Specifies
         the exclusive UTC date-time value for the end of the period of
         interest.  Note that this is the exclusive end value - i.e., it
         represents the date just after the range of interest. e.g., if
         a client wants the expanded date just for the year 2014, it
         would use a start value of "2014-01-01T00:00:00Z" and an end
         value of "2015-01-01T00:00:00Z".  An error occurs if the end
         value is less than or equal to the start value.
