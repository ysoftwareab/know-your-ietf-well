1. Introduction

   This document specifies an Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)
   [1] mechanism for authentication and session key distribution using
   the GSM Subscriber Identity Module (SIM).

   GSM authentication is based on a challenge-response mechanism. The
   authentication algorithm that runs on the SIM can be given a 128-bit
   random number (RAND) as a challenge. The SIM runs an operator-
   specific confidential algorithm which takes the RAND and a secret
   key Ki stored on the SIM as input, and produces a 32-bit response
   (SRES) and a 64-bit long key Kc as output. The Kc key is originally
   intended to be used as an encryption key over the air interface.
   Please find more information about GSM authentication in [2].

   In EAP/SIM, several RAND challenges are used for generating several
   64-bit Kc keys, which are combined to constitute a longer session
   key. EAP/SIM also enhances the basic GSM authentication mechanism by
   accompanying the RAND challenges with a message authentication code
   in order to provide mutual authentication.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this

      by GSM operators.

3. Overview

   Figure 1 shows an overview of the EAP/SIM authentication procedure.
   This version of EAP/SIM exchange uses three roundtrips to authorize
   the user and generate a session key. The Authenticator typically
   communicates with the user's AAA server using an AAA protocol. The
   AAA communications is not shown in the figure.

   The first EAP Request issued by the Authenticator is EAP-
   Request/Identity. The clients response includes the user's
   International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) (Section 4).

   Following the client's EAP-Response/Identity packet, the client
   receives EAP Requests of type 18 (SIM) from the Authenticator and

   sends the corresponding EAP Responses. The EAP packets that are of
   the Type SIM also have a Subtype field. The first EAP-Request/SIM
   packet is of the Subtype 1 (Start). This packet contains the list of
   EAP/SIM protocol version numbers supported by the AAA server. The
   client's response (EAP-Response/SIM/Start) contains the version
   number selected by the client. The client must select one of the
   versions from the EAP Request. The EAP-Response/SIM/Start packet
   also contains the client's key lifetime proposal and a random number
   NONCE_MT, picked up by the client. All subsequent EAP Request and
   Response packets contain the same version as the client's EAP-
   Response/SIM/Start packet. This document describes the EAP/SIM
   protocol version 1.

   In this document, we assume that the AAA server has an interface to
   the GSM network and it operates as a gateway between the Internet
   AAA network and the GSM authentication infrastructure. After
   receiving the EAP Response/SIM/Start, the AAA server obtains n GSM
   triplets from the user's home operator's Authentication Centre (AuC)
   on the GSM network. From the triplets, the AAA server derives
   MAC_RAND and the session key. Section 10 specifies how these
   cryptographic values are calculated.

   The next EAP Request the Authenticator issues is of the type SIM and
   subtype Challenge. It contains the RAND challenges, the key lifetime
   decided by the AAA Server, and a message authentication code for the
   challenges and the lifetime (MAC_RAND). On receipt of this message,
   the client runs the GSM authentication algorithm on the SIM card and
   calculates a copy of MAC_RAND. The client then verifies that the
   calculated MAC_RAND equals the received MAC_RAND. If the MAC_RAND's
   do not match, then the client cancels the authentication procedure
   and does not send any authentication values calculated on the SIM to
   the network.

   Since the RAND's given to a client are accompanied with the message
   authentication code MAC_RAND, the client is able to verify that the
   RAND's are fresh and they have been generated by the GSM network.

   If all checks out, the client responds with the EAP-
   Response/SIM/Challenge, containing the client's response MAC_SRES
   (Section 10). The AAA server verifies that the MAC_SRES is correct
   and sends the EAP-Success packet, indicating that the authentication
   was successful. The AAA server may also include the derived session
   key in the message it sends to the Authenticator.

   In the following sections, we discuss the EAP/SIM authentication and
   key distribution mechanism in detail.

4. EAP-Response/Identity

   In the beginning of EAP authentication, the Authenticator issues the
   EAP-Request/Identity packet to the client. The client responds with
   EAP-Response/Identity, which contains the user's identity. The
   formats of these packets are specified in [1].

   GSM subscribers are identified with the International Mobile
   Subscriber Identity (IMSI) [4]. The IMSI is composed of a three
   digit Mobile Country Code (MCC), a two digit Mobile Network Code
   (MNC) and a not more than 10 digit Mobile Subscriber Identification
   Number (MSIN). In other words, the IMSI is a string of not more than
   15 digits. MCC and MNC uniquely identify the GSM operator.

Internet Draft    EAP SIM Authentication (Version 1)     February 2001


   Internet AAA protocols identify users with the Network Access
   Identifier (NAI) [5]. When used in a roaming environment, the NAI is
   composed of a username and a realm, separated with "@". The username
   portion identifies the subscriber within the realm. The AAA nodes
   use the realm portion of the NAI to route AAA requests to the
   correct AAA server.

   With EAP/SIM, the client transmits the user's IMSI as a NAI in the
   EAP Response/Identity packet. When the IMSI is encoded as a NAI, the
   username portion of the NAI contains the IMSI as a string of digits,
   and the realm portion identifies the AAA server. The AAA network
   routes the AAA request to the correct AAA server using the realm
   part of the NAI.

5. EAP-Request/SIM/Start

   In EAP/SIM Version 1, the first SIM specific EAP Request is of
   subtype Start. The EAP Request/SIM/Start packet contains a list of
   EAP/SIM versions supported by the AAA server. The format of the EAP
   Request/SIM/Start packet is shown below.

   this may occur for example if the AAA server is not able to obtain
   the GSM triplets for the subscriber or the AAA server receives an
   incorrect MAC_SRES.

   As specified in [1], the EAP client must respond with EAP-
   Response/Nak when it receives an EAP Request of an undesired or
   unrecognized authentication type.

   Following subsections describe EAP/SIM specific operations on error
   cases.

9.1. EAP-Response/SIM/Unknown-Subtype

   If the client receives an EAP Request packet of the type SIM with a
   subtype that it does not recognize, the client MUST sends the EAP-
   Response/SIM/Unknown-Subtype packet shown below. The Authenticator
   (or the AAA server) MAY then proceed with other EAP Requests or it
   MAY send an EAP-Failure packet.

9.2. EAP-Response/SIM/Unsupported-Version

   If the client receives an EAP Request packet of the type SIM and a
   subtype that it recognizes, but with a version that it does not
   support, then the client MUST sends the EAP-
   Response/SIM/Unsupported-Version packet shown below. The
   Authenticator (or the AAA server) MAY then proceed with other EAP
   Requests or it MAY send an EAP-Failure packet.

9.3. Other Failures on EAP/SIM Client

   If some other error besides the ones listed above occurs on the
   client, then the client does not send EAP messages to the network
   but simply cancels the authentication procedure. An example of such
   an error is an invalid MAC_RAND value in the EAP-
   Request/SIM/Challenge packet.

10. Calculation of Cryptographic Values

   This section specifies how the SIM-generated session key K and the
   message authentication codes MAC_RAND and MAC_SRES are calculated.

   In the formulae, the notation PRF(key, msg) denotes the keyed
   pseudo-random function used to generate a deterministic output that
   appears pseudo-random. The PRF() is used both for key derivations
   and for authentication (i.e. as a keyed MAC). With EAP/SIM version
   1, the PRF() is HMAC-MD5 [6].

   K

      PRF(n*Kc, n*RAND | IMSI | NONCE_MT)

   MAC_RAND

      PRF(n*Kc, n*RAND | NONCE_MT | key lifetime)

   MAC_SRES

      PRF(n*Kc, n*SRES | IMSI | NONCE_MT)

   When generating the key K, the PRF is used as a mixing function to
   combine several session keys (Kc's) generated by the GSM
   authentication procedure and the random number NONCE_MT into a
   single session key. There are several reasons for this. The current
   GSM session keys are at most 64 bits, so two or more of them are
   needed to generate a 128-bit key. By using a one-way function to
   combine the keys, we are assured that even if an attacker manages to
   learn the EAP/SIM session key, it doesn't help him in learning the
   original GSM Kc's. In addition, since we include the random number
   NONCE_MT in the calculation, the client is able to verify that the
   SIM authentication values it receives from the network are fresh and
   not a replay.

11. IANA Considerations

   IANA has assigned the EAP type number 18 for EAP/SIM authentication.

12. Security Considerations

   The protocol in this document is intended to provide the appropriate
   level of security to operate Extensible Authentication Protocol
   using the GSM SIM.
