                Multicast using Multicast Routing Header
                         draft-chen-pim-mrh6-00

Abstract

   This document describes an efficient solution for multicast along an
   explicit P2MP Path/Tree using an IPv6 extension header called
   multicast routing header (MRH).  The MRH with the path encoded in
   link numbers is added into a packet to be multicast at the ingress.
   The packet is delivered to the egresses along the path.  There is no
   state stored in the core of the network.

   tree is instantiated in the forwarding plane by a controller at Root,
   intermediate Replication nodes and Leaves of the tree.

   [I-D.chen-pim-srv6-p2mp-path] proposes a stateless solution for a SR
   P2MP path.  The overhead for encoding the P2MP path using SIDs in SRH
   may be large.

   This document describes an efficient solution for multicast along an
   explicit P2MP Path/Tree using an IPv6 extension header called
   multicast routing header (MRH).  The MRH with the path encoded in
   link numbers is added into a packet to be multicast at the ingress.
   The packet is delivered to the egresses along the path.  There is no
   state stored in the core of the network.

2.  Overview of Multicast using MRH

   Figure 1 shows an example network having nodes P1, P2, P3, P4, PE1 to
   PE10.  For each of the links connected to a node, a number called
   local link number (or link number for short) is assigned to it.  For
   example, PE1 has three links: link from PE1 to CE1, link from PE1 to
   P1, and link from PE1 to PE10.  These three links have link numbers
   1, 2 and 3 respectively on PE1.  P1 has five links: P1 to PE1, P1 to
   P2, P1 to P3, P1 to PE8 and P1 to PE9.  These five links have link
   numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 respectively on P1.  P3 has two links: P3 to
   P1 and P3 to P4.  These two links have link numbers 1 and 2
   respectively on P3.

   P2MP path from ingress PE1 via P1 towards egresses PE2 to PE9 in
   Figure 1 is represented by the link numbers along the path: PE1's
   link number 2; P1's link numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5; P2's link numbers 1
   and 2; P3's link number 2; and P4's link numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5.

   After receiving a packet from traffic source CE1, ingress PE1
   encapsulates the packet in a MRH with a P2MP path represented by the
   link numbers along the path.  The packet in the MRH is transmitted
   along the path to the egresses of the path.

   When a node such as P1 receives a packet with the MRH, the node gets/
   pops each of its link numbers, finds the address of the next hop from
   a neighbor address table using the link number (i.e., the link number
   such as 3 of the link from the node to the next hop such as P3),
   sends the packet to the next hop (such as P3).

   Figure 2 shows the neighbor IPv6 address table of P1.  The table
   comprises five rows of link number, link type and IPv6 address for
   the five links of P1.  The first row comprises link number 1, link
   type P2P for link from P1 to next hop PE1 and PE1's IPv6 address.
   The 2nd row comprises link number 2, link type P2P for link from P1
   to next hop P2 and P2's IPv6 address.  The 3rd row comprises link
   number 3, link type P2P for link from P1 to next hop P3 and P3's IPv6
   address.  The 4-th row comprises link number 4, link type P2P for
   link from P1 to next hop PE8 and PE8's IPv6 address.  The 5-th row
   comprises link number 5, link type P2P for link from P1 to next hop
   PE9 and PE9's IPv6 address.

           +==============+============+======================+
           | Link number  | Link type  | Address of next hop  |
           +==============+============+======================+
           |      1       |    P2P     | IPv6 address of PE1  |
           +--------------+------------+----------------------+
           |      2       |    P2P     | IPv6 address of P2   |
           +--------------+------------+----------------------+
           |      3       |    P2P     | IPv6 address of P3   |
           +--------------+------------+----------------------+
           |      4       |    P2P     | IPv6 address of PE8  |
           +--------------+------------+----------------------+
           |      5       |    P2P     | IPv6 address of PE9  |
           +==============+============+======================+

                Figure 2: Neighbor IPv6 address table of P1

   Using link number 1, P1 gets PE1's IPv6 address from the table; using
   link number 2, P1 gets P2's IPv6 address from the table; using link
   number 3, P1 gets P3's IPv6 address from the table; and so on.

3.  Encoding of P2MP Path/Tree

   Figure 3 shows the encoding of the P2MP path/tree in Figure 1 from
   PE1 via P1 to PE2, PE3, ..., PE9.  Each link on the tree is encoded
   or represented by the link number of the link.  For example, the link
   from PE1 to P1 on the tree is encoded by link number 2 of the link on
   PE1.  The link from P1 to P2 on the tree is encoded by link number 2
   of the link on P1.  The link from P1 to P3 on the tree is encoded by
   link number 3 of the link on P1.

   For each link from its upstream node to its downstream (or say next
   hop) node on the tree, three fields are used for the link: 1). link
   number (Link-No for short) field for storing the link number, 2).
   number of branches (N-Branches for short) for storing the number
   branches/sub-trees of the tree from the next hop node, and 3). size
   of branches+ (S-Branches+ for short) for storing the size of branches
   of the tree from the next hop node and the fields following.  The
   size is in bits, bytes, or other units.

   For example, for the link from PE1 to P1 on the tree, Link-No field
   has value of 2 since the link number is 2 for the link on PE1;
   N-Branches field has value of 4 since there are 4 branches from P1;
   S-Branches+ field has value of 22 (bytes) since 22 bytes are used for
   storing/encoding 4 branches from P1 when the three fields Link-No,
   N-Branches and S-Branches+ for a link occupy 2 bytes in total.

   For the link from P1 to P2 on the tree, Link-No field has value of 2
   since the link number is 2 for the link on P1; N-Branches field has
   value of 2 since there are two branches from P2; S-Branches+ field
   has value of 14 (bytes) since 14 bytes are used for storing/encoding
   the two branches (i.e., sub-trees) from P2 and the fields following.

   For the link from P1 to P3 on the tree, Link-No field has value of 3
   since the link number is 3 for the link on P1; N-Branches field has
   value of 1 since there is one branch (i.e., sub-tree) from P3;
   S-Branches+ field has value of 10 (bytes) since 10 bytes are used for
   storing/encoding the branch from P3 and no other fields following.

   For the link from P2 to egress PE2 on the tree, Link-No field has
   value of 1 since the link number is 1 for the link on P2; N-Branches
   field has value of 0 since there is no branch (i.e., sub-tree) from
   PE2; S-Branches+ field has value of 0 (bytes).

   Figure 4 shows an enhancement of encoding the P2MP path/tree in
   Figure 1 using L flag.  The L flag added for a link indicates whether
   the next hop is a leaf node.  When L is set to one indicating the
   next hop is a leaf (i.e., egress), the "N-Branches" and "S-Branches+"
   fields are removed.  There are 8 links to leaves (i.e., egress nodes)
   on the tree, which are 2 links from P2 to PE2 and PE3; 4 links from
   P4 to PE4, PE5, PE6 and PE7; and 2 links from P1 to PE8 and PE9.
   These 8 links have their L flags set to one.  The N-Branches and
   S-Branches+ fields for these 8 links are removed from the encoding of
   the tree.  This reduces the space/memory for encoding the tree.

   Figure 4: Encoding of tree from PE1 via P1 to PE2, PE3, ..., PE9 with
                                  L flag

   For example, suppose that two fields L and Link-No with padding
   (padding is not shown) for a link to leaf occupy 1 byte; four fields
   L, Link-No, N-Branches and S-Branches+ for a link to a transit node
   occupy 2 bytes.  In this case, the S-Branches+ field for link from
   PE1 to P1 is 14 (bytes), which is the size of the fields for 11 links
   (i.e., link from P1 to P2, link from P1 to P3, ..., link from P4 to
   PE7) encoding the sub-trees from P1 to PE2, PE3, ..., PE9.  The
   S-Branches+ field for link from P1 to P2 is 8 (bytes), which is the
   size of the fields for 7 links (i.e., link from P2 to PE2, link from
   P2 to PE3, link from P3 to P4, and 4 links from P4 to PE4 - PE7)
   encoding the sub-trees from P1 to PE2 and PE3, and the fields
   following them.

   Encoding the tree without L flag occupies 24 bytes in total as
   illustrated in Figure 3.  Encoding the tree with L flag occupies 16
   bytes in total as illustrated in Figure 4.  8 bytes (or say 33% of
   space/memory) are saved/reduced.

   Figure 5 shows an enhancement of encoding the branch/sub-tree from P3
   to PE4, PE5, PE6 and PE7 in Figure 1 using B flag.  The B flag added
   for a link indicates whether the link bits+ are used to represent the
   link numbers and other link related information such as whether
   links' remote end nodes (i.e., next hops) are leaves.  When B flag
   for the link from upstream node such as P3 to downstream node such as
   P4 is set to one indicating the link bits+ are used, the links from
   downstream node such as P4 on the tree are encoded or represented by
   link bits+.  A link bits+ contains a P (short for plus leaf) field,
   S-Bits (short for size of the bits in a unit such as byte) field, and
   Bits field.

   P field has a value such as 1 indicating that a bit with value of 1
   (one) in Bits field means that the corresponding link is on the
   branch and the link's next hop is a leaf.  There are four links to
   leaves (i.e., egress nodes) from P4, which are link from P4 to PE4
   with link number 2, link from P4 to PE5 with link number 3, link from
   P4 to PE6 with link number 4, and link from P4 to PE7 with link
   number 5.  These four links are represented by the 2-th bit, 3-th
   bit, 4-th bit and 5-th bit in the Bits field (from left to right)
   respectively.

   S-Bits field has a value such as 1 indicating the size of the Bits
   field in a unit such as byte.

   Suppose that the fields (i.e., L, B, Link-No, No-Branches and
   S-Branches+) for the link from P3 to P4 occupy 2 bytes; P and S-Bits
   occupy 1 byte.  In this case, the link bits+ for the links from P4
   occupy 2 bytes, encoding the branch from P3 uses 4 bytes in total.

   The number of branches from P4 is the number of bits with value of
   one in the Bits field.  The N-Branches field for the link from P3 to
   P4 is used for other purpose.  For example, N-Branches field and
   S-Branches+ field combined to represent the size of the branches plus
   the fields following (i.e., S-Branches+).

   Figure 6 shows an enhancement of encoding the branch part from PE1
   via P1 to P2, P3, PE8 and PE9 on the P2MP tree/path in Figure 1 using
   B flag.  B flag for the link from upstream node PE1 to downstream
   node P1 is set to one indicating that the link bits+ are used to
   represent the information about the links on the tree from downstream
   node P1.

   P field has a value such as 0 indicating that a bit with value of 1
   (one) in Bits field means that the corresponding link from downstream
   node P1 is on the tree.

   S-Bits field has a value such as 1 indicating the size of Bits field
   in a unit such as byte.

   Bits field of one byte has the second (2-th) bit, third (3-th) bit,
   4-th bit and 5-th bit set to one (from left to right), indicating
   four links from P1 on the tree: the link from P1 to P2 with link
   number 2, link from P1 to P3 with link number 3, link from P1 to PE8
   with link number 4 and link from P1 to PE9 with link number 5.  The
   fields for each of these links do not have Link-No field, which is
   called reduced fields.

   of branches from P2 is 2 and the size of the branches from P2 plus
   the fields following is 6.

   The reduced fields (i.e., L = 0, B = 0, No-Branches = 1, S-Branches+
   = 4) for the link from P1 to P3 indicates that the link's next hop is
   not leaf, link bits+ is not used for the branches from P3, the number
   of branches from P3 is 1 and the size of the branches from P3 plus
   the fields following is 4.

   The reduced fields (i.e., L = 1) for the link from P1 to PE8
   indicates that the link's next hop PE8 is a leaf.

   The reduced fields (i.e., L = 1) for the link from P1 to PE9
   indicates that the link's next hop PE9 is a leaf.

   Suppose the fields (i.e., L, B, Link-No, No-Branches and S-Branches+)
   for a link to a transit node occupy 2 bytes; P and S-Bits occupy 1
   byte; the reduced fields (i.e., L, B, No-Branches and S-Branches+)
   for a link to a transit node occupy 11 bits, the reduced fields
   (i.e., L) for a link to a leaf occupy 1 bit.  In this case the
   reduced fields for four links from P1 to P2, P3, PE8 and PE9 uses 3
   bytes (i.e., 24 bits).  Encoding the branch part from PE1 via P1 to
   P2, P3, PE8 and PE9 uses 7 bytes.

   Figure 7 shows an enhancement of encoding the P2MP path/tree in
   Figure 1 using both L and B flags.

   The branch part from PE1 via P1 to P2, P3, PE8 and PE9 is the same as
   the one in Figure 6 and occupies 7 bytes.

   The link from P2 to PE2 is represented by L = 1 and Link-No = 1.  The
   link from P2 to PE3 is represented by L = 1 and Link-No = 2.  These
   two links occupy 2 bytes.  In an option, when L = 1, the Link-No
   field and Pad are combined to represent link number.

   The branch from P3 is the same as the one in Figure 5 and occupies 4
   bytes.  Encoding the tree of 13 nodes uses 13 bytes in total.

   The P2MP path/tree from PE1 via P1 to PE2 - PE9 in Figure 1 is
   encoded by the link numbers of the links on the tree as illustrated
   in Figure 7.  The link from ingress PE1 to P1 is encoded by the link

   on the tree, and the size of the branches+ from P1, which is 11.  The

   Bits field for the links from P1 to P2, P3, PE8 and PE9, which is 4
   since there are 4 bits with value 1 in the Bits field.

   For an IP multicast packet to be transmitted by the P2MP path/tree,
   PE1 constructs an IPv6 packet for each sub-tree/branch from PE1 and
   sends the packet containing a MRH and the IP multicast packet to the
   next hop along the sub-tree.

   The P2MP path/tree has one sub-tree from PE1 via P1 to PE2 - PE9.
   PE1 finds P1's IPv6 address from PE1's neighbor IPv6 address table
   using the link number 2 and sets DA (destination address) of the IPv6
   packet to P1's IPv6 address and SA (source address) of the IPv6
   packet to PE1's IPv6 address.  PE1 builds the MRH based on the
   encoding of the tree in Figure 7 through setting b flag to 1, which
   is the value of B for the link from PE1 to P1, SL to 11, which is the
   value of S-Branches+ for the link from PE1 to P1.  nB is not set
   since B = 1.  Figure 10 shows the IPv6 packet to be sent to P1, which
   is received by P1.  Note that some details are not shown.

   PE9.  This is determined by b = 1 and the Bits+ fields pointed by SL
   = 11.

   There are 4 links from P1.  The 2-th bit in the Bits field has value
   1 indicating the link with link number 2, which is the link from P1
   to P2.  The reduced fields (i.e., L = 0, B = 0, No-Branches = 2,
   S-Branches+ = 6) for the link indicates that the link's next hop P2
   is not leaf, link bits+ is not used for the branches from P2, the
   number of branches from P2 is 2 and the size of the branches from P2
   plus the fields following is 6.

   The 3-th bit has value 1 indicating the link with link number 3,
   which is the link from P1 to P3.  The reduced fields (i.e., L = 0, B
   = 0, No-Branches = 1, S-Branches+ = 4) for the link indicates that
   the link's next hop P3 is not leaf, link bits+ is not used for the
   branches from P3, the number of branches from P3 Is 1 and the size of
   the branches from P3 plus the fields following is 4.

   The 4-th bit has value 1 indicating the link with link number 4,
   which is the link from P1 to PE8.  PE8 is a leaf, which is indicated
   by the first L = 1.  The 5-th bit has value 1 indicating the link
   with link number 5, which is the link from P1 to PE9.  PE9 is a leaf
   indicated by the second L = 1.

   The link number of the link from P2 to leaf PE2 is 1 on P2.  The link
   number of the link from P2 to leaf PE3 is 2 on P2.  The link number
   of the link from P3 to P4 is 2 on P3.  The size of branches from P4
   is 2.  The link numbers of the links from P4 to leaf PE4, PE5, PE6
   and PE7 are 2, 3, 4 and 5 on P4 respectively.

   After receiving the IPv6 packet from PE1, P1 determines whether the
   packet's next header is a MRH through checking if the next header is
   routing header and routing type in the routing header is TBD for MRH.
   When the next header is the MRH, P1 duplicates the packet for each
   link/branch/sub-tree from P1 and sends the packet copy with an
   updated MRH (note: only SL, b and nB are updated) to the next hop
   along the branch.  Since b = 1, the number of bits with value 1 in
   the Bits field of Bits+ pointed by SL = 11 is the number of branches/
   links from P1 according to Figure 10, which is 4.

   The 2-th bit in the Bits field has value 1 indicating the link with
   link number 2, which is the link from P1 to P2.  The first reduced
   fields is for link from P1 to P2 and indicates the number of branches
   from P2 is 2 and the size of branches from P2 plus the ones following
   them is 6.

   P1 duplicates the packet for the link with link number 2, finds P2's
   IPv6 address from P1's neighbor IPv6 address table using the link

   P4 duplicates the packet for the first branch, finds PE4's IPv6

   MRH based on the encoding of the sub-tree in Figure 13 through
   setting SL to 0 since PE4 is a leaf.  Figure 14 shows the packet to

              Figure 14: IPv6 packet with MRH received by PE4

   After receiving the packet from P4, PE4 determines whether the
   packet's next header is a MRH.  When the packet's next header is the
   MRH, PE4 checks if PE4 itself is a leaf (i.e., egress) through
   checking whether SL is 0.  When PE4 is a leaf, PE4 decapsulates the
   packet and sends the IP multicast datagram to the IP multicast
   forwarding module.

   Alternatively, after receiving the packet from P3 and determining
   that the packet's next header is a MRH, P4 checks if each of its next
   hops is a leaf.  When the next hop is a leaf, P4 decapsulates the
   packet and sends the IP multicast datagram to the next hop.  Since 4
   next hops PE4 - PE7 are leaves, P4 sends the IP multicast datagram to
   PE4 - PE7.

5.  Procedures/Behaviors

   This section describes the procedures or behaviors on the ingress,
   transit and egress/leaf node of a P2MP path to deliver a packet
   received from the path to its destinations.

5.1.  Procedure/Behavior on Ingress Node

   For a packet to be transported by a P2MP Path, the ingress of the
   P2MP path duplicates the packet for each sub-tree/branch of the P2MP
   path branching from the ingress, encapsulates the packet copy in a
   MRH containing the sub-tree and sends the encapsulated packet copy to
   the next hop node along the sub-tree.

   For example, there is one sub-tree branching from the ingress of the
   P2MP path/tree in Figure 1.  The sub-tree is from ingress PE1 via

Internet-Draft             Multicast using MRH                March 2022


   next hop node P1 towards PE2 to PE9.  PE1 sends P1 the packet as
   shown in Figure 10.

5.2.  Procedure/Behavior on Transit Node

   When a transit node of a P2MP path/tree receives a packet transported
   by the P2MP path/tree, the node determines whether the current
   routing header is a MRH.  After determining that it is a MRH, the
   node executes the procedure to duplicate the packet for each of the
   downstream links of the node on the P2MP path/tree and send the
   packet copy to next hop (i.e., downstream node) of the link.

   Suppose that the transit node receives the packet from a upstream
   link from a upstream node to the transit node and there are n
   downstream links from the transit node on the P2MP path/tree (i.e.,
   there are n branches/sub-trees from the transit node on the P2MP
   path/tree, where n is greater than zero).

   The information about the upstream link is in b and nB field of the
   MRH.  When b = 0, nB field contains the number of branches from the
   transit node.  The information about n downstream links is pointed by
   SL.  When b = 1, the number of branches from the transit node is the
   number of bits with value 1 in the Bits field of the Bits+ fields
   pointed by SL.  The information about n downstream links is encoded
   by the Bits field and the fields following the Bits field.

   For example, when node P1 receives the packet transported by the P2MP
   path/tree in Figure 1 from ingress PE1, the MRH is illustrated in
   Figure 10.  The b = 1, the Bits field of the Bits+ fields pointed by
   SL = 11 has 4 bits with value 1.  So there are 4 branches from P1.
   The information about 4 downstream links (i.e., link from P1 to P2,
   link from P1 to P3, link from P1 to PE8 and link from P1 to PE9) is
   encoded by the Bits field and the reduced fields for these 4 links
   following the Bits field.

   For each of the downstream links of the transit node, the transit
   node duplicates the packet for the link, sets SL, b and nB in the
   packet copy accordingly.  If the next hop is a leaf (i.e., egress),
   the transit node sets SL to 0; otherwise, the transit node sets SL, b
   and nB to the value of S-Branches+, B and N-Branches for the link
   respectively when B is 0.  When B = 1, the transit node sets SL and b
   to the value of S-Branches+ and B for the link respectively.  The
   transit node finds the IPv6 address of the next hop (i.e., the
   downstream node) of the link from the neighbor IPv6 address table of
   the transit node using the link number of the link, sets the DA of
   the packet copy to the IPv6 address of the next hop, sets the SA of
   the packet copy to the IPv6 address of the transit node, and sends
   the packet copy to the next hop of the link.

Internet-Draft             Multicast using MRH                March 2022


   For example, for the first downstream link from P1 (i.e., link from
   P1 to P2), P1 duplicates the packet for the link, sets SL to 6 (which
   is the value of the S-Branches+ field for the link), b to 0 (which is
   the value of B for the link) and nB to 2 (which is the value of the
   N-Branches field for the link).  P1 finds the IPv6 address of the
   next hop P2 of the link from the neighbor IPv6 address table of P1
   using the link number 2 of the link, sets the DA of the packet copy
   to the P2's IPv6 address, sets the SA of the packet copy to the P1's
   IPv6 address, and sends the packet copy to P2.  The packet copy
   received by P2 is shown in Figure 11.

   For the second downstream link from P1 (i.e., link from P1 to P3), P1
   duplicates the packet for the link, sets SL, b and nB to 4, 0 and 1
   respectively, which are the values of S-Branches+, B and N-Branches
   for the link from P1 to P3 respectively.  P1 finds the IPv6 address
   of the next hop P3 of the link from the neighbor IPv6 address table
   of P1 using the link number 3 of the link, sets the DA of the packet
   copy to the P3's IPv6 address, sets the SA of the packet copy to the
   P1's IPv6 address, and sends the packet copy to P3.  The packet copy
   received by P3 is illustrated in Figure 12.

   For the 3-th downstream link from P1 (i.e., link from P1 to PE8), P1
   duplicates the packet for the link, sets SL to 0 since PE8 is a leaf
   (i.e., egress).  P1 finds the IPv6 address of the next hop PE8 of the
   link from the neighbor IPv6 address table of P1 using the link number
   4 of the link, sets the DA of the packet copy to the PE8's IPv6
   address, sets the SA of the packet copy to the P1's IPv6 address, and
   sends the packet copy to PE8.

5.3.  Procedure/Behavior on Egress Node

   When an egress node of a P2MP path receives a packet transported by
   the path, the DA of the packet is the IPv6 address of the egress node
   and there is an indication in the MRH for the leaf/egress.  The
   egress node proceeds to process the next header in the packet.

   For example, after receiving the IPv6 packet from P4, PE4 determines
   whether the packet's next header is a MRH.  When the packet's next
   header is the MRH, PE4 checks if PE4 itself is a leaf (i.e., egress)
   through checking whether SL is 0.  When PE4 is a leaf, PE4
   decapsulates the packet and sends the IP multicast datagram to the IP
   multicast forwarding module.
