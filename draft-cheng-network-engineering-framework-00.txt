1. Introduction and Background

1.1 Long-term and Short-term Internet Engineering Models

Figure 1 illustrates the long-term and short-term Internet Engineering 
model for a network. Traditionally, Network Planning is used to build a 
physical network with static topology. Traffic Engineering is used to 
optimize network resource utilization for traffic demands. It is the 
optimization of network resources based on a fixed network topology. It 
allows traffic to utilize network resources in an efficient way. 
Network Planning is a long-term process to optimize network resources 
for long-term traffic growth, while Traffic Engineering is a short-term 
process to optimize network resources for short-term traffic 
fluctuation.

1.2 Conventional Traffic Engineering and Limitation

Traffic Engineering, in short is putting traffic where the capacity is. 
This is contrasted with Network Engineering, which is putting capacity 
to where the traffic wants to be.

[TE-FRWK] has a detailed definition of Internet Traffic Engineering. 
"Internet traffic engineering is defined as that aspect of Internet 
Network Engineering dealing with the issues of performance evaluation 
and performance optimization of operational IP networks. Traffic 
Engineering encompasses the application of technology and scientific 
principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and control 
of Internet traffic [RFC-2702, AWD2] ... "

In traditional IP traffic engineering, the underlying network topology 
is assumed to be relatively static [rfc2702, te-MPLS-diff]. In 
particular, the links connecting the IP/MPLS routers in the backbone 
are typically provisioned for a long period of time due to the 
difficulties of rapid reconfiguration of the links.

The main objective of IP/MPLS traffic engineering is efficient mapping 
of traffic demands onto the network topology to maximize resource 
utilization while meeting QoS constraints such as delay and packet 
loss. The traffic demands may be obtained from measurement, projection, 
customer prescription, Service Level Agreement (SLA), or combination of 
the above. The mapping may be done in a multi-period fashion 
corresponding to diurnal or weekly patterns. In a MPLS network, the 
mapping is facilitated by establishing explicit label switched paths. 
In a connectionless IP network, the mapping can be attempted by 
adjusting IGP weights. 

The key assumption of current Internet Traffic Engineering is that the 
total network resources for IP routers to use are fixed. This 
assumption is changed by the Automatically Switched Transport Network 
(ASTN). Instead of a fixed amount of resources, the total network 
resources for IP routers can now be flexible. The IP network can get 
more resources from its provider network, which may be a lower layer 
network. It can also return resources to its provider network. The ASTN 
is a provider network to the IP network, which provides a flexible 
network resource pool to the IP client network. However, the resources 
(bandwidth, links, ports) of the pool are limited.



1.3 Layered Network 

In the computational view, the network is layered. For "switching" 
networks, they can be layered according to network's "switching" 
granularity. For example, an IP router's switching granularity is a 
packet; a SONET circuit's switching granularity is STS-1; a non-OEO 
optical switch's switching granularity is a wavelength. These different 
types of NEs are at different network layers. They form client/server 
relationship among each other.

     __________________________________________V________________

                  Figure 1 Switching Hierarchies


This layered view doesn't need to translate into implementation or 
network partition directly. In the computational view, there is a 
separate logical control entity for each layer. In the implementation, 
these entities may collapse or integrated onto a single control plane. 
However, it is critical to understand implication of layering to the 
Network Engineering process. 

The implication of layering is that network connections at different 
logical layers are triggered by different reasons and may be created at 
different time because of:


(1) Bandwidth*Time Mismatch

The bandwidth*time in the IP user networks is of finer granularity; 
whereas the bandwidth*time in the provider networks is of larger 
granularity. Hence, multiple IP links often tunneled into a link to 
increase link utilization. The holding time of an IP link is usually 
shorter than the holding time of an optical link, since an optical link 
typically contains multiple IP links. Tearing down one or more IP links 
may only result in the reduction of bandwidth in an optical link. 
Tearing down an optical link can only be done if all constituent IP 
links are torn down, or if the remaining IP links can be re-routed 
through another optical link.


(2) Cost/Value Mismatch

The establishment of a link incurs a certain cost to the client IP 
network. It is important that the cost is within a planned budget. This 
may involve re-optimization and tearing down some circuit links. The 
circuit network is a limited resource, it is important that the total 
value of the links established from a circuit network is maximized.



1.4 Conventional IP Network Planning and Limitation

In conventional IP network, static topology is normally set up at the 
network planning time according to the most stringent traffic demand 
patterns in a given duration. Because of forecasting mismatch and the 
inability of changing the network topology fast enough, Traffic 
Engineering limits itself to achieve higher network resource 
utilization. 

Observe that the static topology of the IP network introduces 
limitations. Consider first the case when traffic demands are well 
estimated a priori. In this case, provisioning needs to be done 
according to the most stringent traffic demand patterns in a given 
duration (even under the assumption that the best TE plan, which can 
take advantages of multi-period traffic pattern is used). Therefore, 
network resources remain under-utilized when traffic demands are light 
(e.g., during weekends or evenings) since provisioned links cannot be 
released easily.

When the traffic demands cannot be estimated accurately, network 
planning may not be done correctly. For example, if link provisioning 
is inadequate, traffic demands can exceed the required network 
resources. This may occur because of forecasting mismatch or the 
inability of provisioning the network fast enough to meet the growth in 
resource requirements. On the other hand, it may be necessary to over-
provision the network due to the difficulties of forecasting the 
traffic growth accurately.

Furthermore, if the provisioning cycle (i.e., the time it takes to add 
resources to the network) is long, resource provisioning needs to take 
into account the projected traffic growth until the beginning of the 
next cycle. Consequently the extra network resources may be 
significantly under-utilized at the early part of a cycle if the 
projected growth is large.



1.5 Terminology

Link-connection û one channel between subnets. That is to say one unit 
of capacity between subnets. A link connection may or may not be 
carrying traffic.

Link û a set of all link connections between a pair of subnets that are 
equivalent for routing. This definition allows a link to have zero link 
connections.

An IP link û a unidirectional physical connection between two IP 
routers. Note that usually IP links are bi-directional. Any request for 
a bi-directional link can then be accomplished by two requests, each 
for an uni-directional link. It could be an optical network connection 
through the underlying circuit switched network. In this case, an IP 
router has logical adjacency with its IP router peer and physical 
adjacency with the circuit switch that it is connected to.

A configurable IP link-connection û an IP link, which can be 
dynamically setup and released within the circuit-switched layer, thus 
may actively change the IP network topology.

A non-configurable IP link-connection û an IP link, which cannot be 
dynamically setup and released within the circuit-switched layer.

User Network û an IP network, which can dynamically setup and release a 
link within the circuit-switched Network.

Provider Network û a circuit-switched network, which can dynamically 
setup and release a link for the user network.

Capacity û The ability of a link or link connection to carry traffic, 
doesnÆt imply the traffic is present or not present.

Traffic û the presence of traffic in the capacity of a link or link 
connection.

Overloaded port û A port which has more traffic than the port capacity

Overloaded router û An IP router which has no more port capacity for 
addition traffic

Configurability û the ability of the IP layer to add a link, delete a 
link, and modify the parameter(s) of a link.


2. Network Engineering 

2.1 Why Network Engineering

We present a first-draft description of Internet Network Engineering 
functionality and capabilities to address the limitation of classic IP 
Traffic Engineering and Network Planning. Figure 2 illustrates the 
engineering hierarchy for an Internet Engineering Process for a network 
to satisfy traffic demands from both short-term and long-term 
perspectives.

               Figure 2 Engineering Hierarchy


We consider a network consists of a set of IP routers that are inter-
connected either through fix links or through a set of circuit 
switches. That is, there are two logical layers, i.e., IP layer and the 
underlying circuit-switched layer. These two logical layers interact in 
a user-provider relationship. The circuit-switched layer can be thought 
of as merely providing dynamically configurable links for the client 
network. 

Network Engineering considers user link configuration within a provider 
domain, hence the choice of the signaling protocol, which will carry 
parameters defined in this paper, is not relevant for the time being.



2.2 What is Network Engineering

Network Engineering is a part of a larger Network Planning function, 
which makes decisions on installing fiber and network equipment for a 
network based on forecast traffic demands. The user network and 
provider network will have independent Network Planning processes. The 
computation for Network Planning is typically done offline since it 
involves searching on multi-dimensional solution spaces. Network 
Engineering is an automation of the part of Network Planning that can 
be supported from a provider network.

Network Engineering is an automatic network provisioning procedure. It 
is to allocate/de-allocate provider network resources to be used by the 
user network. In other words, Network Engineering is to put the 
capacity where the traffic wants to be.

Internet Network Engineering process concerns with the management of 
the (virtual) links in the IP network based on the traffic demands that 
are expected between any two routers in the network (pro-active) and 
the actual traffic demands (re-active). The fundamental issue is 
design, ranking, and choice of an IP link, which is to be established 
by the circuit-switched layer.

It is also worth being able to calculate the number of current open 
connections and the maximum number of open connections allowed (due to 
limits in either capacity or connection identifiers). Network 
Engineering may also add a link or modify (i.e. increase) a link on 
request of a traffic engineering process (if compliant with policy), 
which is not able to complete a call in the absence of available 
bandwidth. 

In the following sub-sections, we will elaborate the ôhowö, ôwhenö, and 
ôwhereö concept.



2.3 How 

To data network, conventional transport networks are "static". They are 
provisioned as leased line services. Classic IP TE considers a fixed IP 
layer topology. 

A distributed transport control plane can provide an on-demand 
automatic choice and configuration of underlying circuits to be used in 
the IP layer. The new control plane of the transport network transforms 
the "dummy pipes" into a foundation for switched connection services, a 
service platform that can provide automatic link provisioning function 
rather than simple transmission. This new function enables numerous 
upper layer services.

This new dynamic of adding and deleting capacity of the transport 
network has profound impacts on conventional data networking. It 
changes the data network's basic assumption that the transport network 
consists of fixed pipes, i.e., a static network. In the new paradigm, 
the transport network can be considered as a configurable back plane. 
Packet switches can dynamically adjust the network topology according 
to end network traffic to optimize overall network performance. 



2.4 When

Network Engineering also monitors the layered network to determine 
- when a new link should be added to the IP network, 
- when an existing link should be modified (i.e. increased or 
reduced), or 
- when a link should be released. 

Network Engineering is a new functional module in addition to 
conventional Traffic Engineering. This function is independent of any 
network models (e.g., peers, overlay or augmented)). 



2.5 Where

The connection resources available from the provider network are 
limited. Network Engineering much choose where the most beneficial 
links to add. Network Engineering should also monitor the bandwidth 
demands from a source/destination relationship in order to identify the 
traffic patterns in the network. Where necessary, a network's topology 
can be optimized by e.g. adding direct links between two heavily 
interconnected nodes. Decisions are taken based on policies set by the 
network operator. 

Many efforts have been devoted to the control plane design. That is, 
ôhowö to automatically provision a link. Our work on the other hand 
focuses on ôwhenö and ôwhereö to automatically provision a link.



3. Architectural Element of Network Engineering 

3.1 Architectural Overview

Figure 3 shows an architecture for the Network Engineering. A decision 
making functional module is triggered by some triggering mechanisms 
(e.g., proactive input or reactive input), and takes the current 
network status (e.g., traffic information and topology information) to 
compute the output. 

The input of the Network Engineering process is the current measured 
state of the user network. Proactive information makes possible traffic 
shaping for particular purposes, e.g., busy hour, network overload 
threshold, etc. The proactive mechanism might also use the bandwidth 
advertising from the circuit network in order to pre-estimate the links 
to establish. The bandwidth advertising might be invoked periodically. 
Reactive information can trigger the establishment of new links upon 
measured performance.

The output of the Network Engineering phase is a target IP link, which 
can be configured as a switched circuit. In other words, the result of 
the Network Engineering is to add a link, delete a link, or modify 
parameters of a link.

3.2 Traffic Information

An IP network has network internal information and external 
information, that can be applied to proactively or reactively 
triggering switched links. 

The network internal information deals with the traffic statistics 
collected over a certain period of time, based on which particular 
traffic flows can be established according to the predictable traffic 
patterns. The internal information can also trigger the reconfiguration 
of the existing traffic patterns for more efficient service-level 
guarantees or network throughput. This information is reactive but can 
be also used predictively by assuming cyclic traffic patterns.

The network-external information deals with boundary-to-boundary 
traffic requests. If such a request identifies an amount of resources 
that is needed to predict the need for circuits. This information can 
be neither estimated nor measured. An example of such information might 
be a new contract or a new traffic request. In this case, for example, 
the predictable traffic patterns as defined by the long-term traffic 
measurements have to be revised. 

Examples of internal information are: packet loss [rfc2680], router 
overload, port overload, link overload. Examples of external 
information are: SLA violations, or new SLAs. Such information triggers 
the network design to automatically configure an IP link. Depending on 
the triggering information, configuration can be adding, deleting 
circuit links, or modifying existing traffic parameters.

Both external and internal information may result in connection 
requests. The network-internal information are obtained based on the 
measurements within the user network, and the network-external 
information can be estimated based on the service contract information 
related to the new traffic.



3.3 Network Topology Information

3.3.1 IP Network Topology Information

In order to perform Network Engineering function, the IP router need to 
have the following topology information:

1. Conventional Routes to IP peers 
These are standard IP routes to various destinations learnt through 
conventional IGPs (e.g., ISIS or OSPF) as well as EGPs (e.g., BGP).

2. Forwarding Adjacencies
Forwarding Adjacencies [LSP-HIER] are IP (i.e., Layer 3) neighbors that 
are connected by an underlying circuit-LSP through a provider network. 
These connections are dynamic in nature and can be set up and torn down 
as required. 

Both IP routes and Forwarding Adjacencies are used for packet 
forwarding. Such information is disseminated using the usual IGP/EGP 
routing protocols. A Provider network treats traffic carrying this kind 
of information as user traffic. In addition to these two types of 
information, a client network also maintains information about:

3. Potential Fas -
PFAs are remote CAGs [BGP/GMPLS]. They represent NEs that belong to the 
same client network (in a remote location) or to a different client 
network that allows NEs in the local network to connect to it. The NEs 
represented by a PFA are not connected yet but can be connected to the 
local NE. Such a connection is a direct connection at the IP layer with 
an underlying physical connection that spans multiple AS-es. 

Information about PFAs can be disseminated through BGP extensions in 
the provider network or some other directory server/yellow pages 
mechanism.

4. Accessible IP Routes through the PFAs
This provides information about all the IP routers reachable through a 
PFA endpoint. For example, in Figure 1, a route to A1 would be an 
accessible IP route reachable through PFA A2 from the viewpoint of 
router A5. Such information can be used for the IP Network Engineering 
[NE-FRWK] function to determine the source and destination of the 
optical circuit connections.

Although this document does not address the issue of how this 
information is disseminated, we note here that various options exist 
for doing so. These options include dissemination through established 
client network connections or a dedicated client network control plane 
network. 


3.3.2 Server Network Topology Information

There is no topology information exchange needed at the user-provider 
boundary. The user knows its own topology and treats the provider 
network as a point-like switch.



3.4 Triggering Mechanisms

There is a set of triggering events, which defines ôwhenö to activate 
network engineering function. 	

1. Direct user request û User should be able to request a network 
engineering function. For example, an operator may need to do on-
line or off-line capacity planning or business modeling for his 
network. 

2. Response to adding a link û It is among network engineering 
capability to add a link to the network. The request maybe a result 
of future planning of the network or an unexpected traffic loads.

3. Response to deleting a link û It is among network engineering 
capability to delete a link from the network. The request maybe a 
result of future planning to an expected reduced traffic loads.

4. Response to modifying a link û It is among Network Engineering 
capability to modify a link to the network. If the request is to 
increase the capacity of a link, it maybe a result of future 
planning of the network or an unexpected traffic loads. If the 
request is to decrease the capacity of a link, it maybe a result of 
future planning or reduced traffic loads.	

5. Congestion condition û Congestion problem is probably one of the 
most studied problem in contemporary Internet networks. When a 
congestion condition is not properly handled, it will significantly 
degrade network performance.	
 
6. Router overload û Upon a router overload condition, it is desirable 
to find an alternative route for traffic going through the router.

7. Link overload û Upon a link overload condition, it is desirable to 
add more capacity parallel to the congested link. If this is not 
feasible, it is desirable to increase capacity over a different 
route and redirect some of the existing traffic to the newly added 
link to relief the overloaded condition.	

8. Maintenance û In the maintenance phase, it is also desirable to run 
Network Engineering function.	

9. Failure û Upon a failure situation, e.g., link failure, network 
failure, etc., it is desirable to run Network Engineering function.	

10. Routine û If none of the above condition occurs, it is desirable 
to run the Network Engineering function on a regular basis. 
Routinely running network engineering function can insure that the 
network is making the most efficient use of it network resources. 
The interval of the routine depends on the network sizes and traffic 
loads of the network.



3.5 The Decision Making Module

Network Engineering decision making module will involve the path 
computation depending on the knowledge of the layered network. The 
problem of selecting a new link that best satisfies demands for 
bandwidth is a multi-dimensional optimization problem, i.e. one that is 
mathematically "hard" and probably not possible to compute perfectly, 
even in principle. This problem can be decomposed into two parts: link 
design, and link choice. The design phase identifies a set of links 
that would satisfy some needs; whereas the choice phase chooses a final 
set of links based on maximizing total value.

First of all, link design provides a set of potential links that meets 
the following criteria:

1. links that are configurable in the circuit-switched layer (e.g., 
with free ports, and free capacities), and

2. links that has enough capacity to meet traffic demands. 

During the design phase, we distinguish different types of links based 
on the number of hops the link bridges. The output of link design can 
be zero or more candidate links to be ôconfiguredö (e.g., add, delete, 
modify) in the circuit-switched layer. If no link is selected, it means 
blocking in the circuit layer.

Secondly in the choice phase, a set of criteria, for choosing a final 
link amongst a set of candidate links, is needed. The criteria are 
based on the consideration of bandwidth, distance, and duration. Link 
choice ranks the set of potential links, selected from the above link 
design, according to the following set of parameters:

1. number of hops bridged,

2. bandwidth utilization of the new link,


3. value (or more correctly, rate of return on investment),
 
4. number of switched-ports spared, or


5. etc.

It then requests the reduced set of maximum value from the potential 
links. One implication of the link choice is that a link design may get 
refused for reasons of insufficient value.

The value of any link requested can be expressed by 

1. multiple attributes (as listed for link choice) or 

2. a single metric mixed out of multiple parameters (e.g. bandwidth, 
distance, etc.). 


To avoid the problems of multi-dimensional optimization as described 
above, a single metric can be chosen as precedent, based on which a 
choice is made if all other requirements are satisfied. 



3.6 Link Operations

There are four types of link operations:
1. add a link	
Adding a link is to add a potential route with zero capacity. This 
type of link bridges two or more hops of existing IP links. Note 
that it changes the IP network topology without adding new capacity. 
Routing tables will need to be modified.	

Consider an IP (user) over an circuit (provider) network, where 
traffic flows from the source node A to the destination node Z. The 
following figure shows adding a new link p-s.	

A      p      q      r      s       Z	
O------O......O......O......O-------O
       :....................:

 
2. add a link connection	
Adding a link connection is to increase the capacity of an existing 
link. This new link (connection) bridges a single hop of IP link. It 
parallels an existing link and increases capacity of this link 
without changing the network topology. The following figure shows 
adding a new link connection r-s.	

A      p      q      r       s       Z	
O------O......O......O:::::::O-------O
       

3. delete a link connection		
This operation is only allowed when the traffic of that link 
connection is zero. Deleting a link connection is to decrease the 
capacity of a link. It may reduce the capacity of a link to zero.

4. delete a link	 
This operation is only allowed when the number of link connections 
in the link is zero. That is, when the capacity of the link is zero. 
To delete a link means to remove a potential route with zero 
capacity.


For the purpose of network engineering, if we need a new link with some 
capacity, we need to add a link (with zero capacity), and then add a 
new link connection to increase the capacity of this new link. If we 
need to delete a link, we will need to delete all the link connections 
in that link before deleting the link.

4 Network Engineering and Traffic Engineering - A Closed-loop Relation 

This section illustrates a closed-loop relationship between Network 
Engineering and Traffic Engineering processes (Figure 4). A closed-loop 
link provisioning process would automatically configure circuits in the 
circuit network [cheng1]. The cycle is closed because changes in 
bandwidth or topology affect the state of the user network.

Within the circuit layer a choice between candidate switched circuits 
can be made for the IP network in order to have the maximum advantages 
of a dynamic configuration. All circuits, which may be configured, are 
within the bounds requested by the IP layer, otherwise the request is 
rejected. 



5. Summary

In this paper, we have outlined an early draft for an Internet Network 
Engineering framework. Traffic problems, which occur due to the 
limitations of Traffic Engineering, can trigger Network Engineering 
processes to further optimize the network performance. Network 
Engineering is to automatically select a link for addition, deletion, 
and modification to address Traffic Engineering limitation. Network 
Engineering and Traffic Engineering form a closed-loop process to 
optimize the network resources.

We also note that the specific choice of technologies is not essential 
to a Network Engineering process. It is important to recognize the 
problem is recursive. The closed-loop process for Network Engineering 
and Traffic Engineering is applicable to any user-provider relationship 
networks.
