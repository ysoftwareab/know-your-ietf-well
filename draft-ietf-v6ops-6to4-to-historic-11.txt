           Deprecating Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers
                draft-ietf-v6ops-6to4-to-historic-11.txt

Abstract

   Experience with the "Connection of IPv6 Domains via IPv4 Clouds
   (6to4)" IPv6 transition mechanism defined in RFC 3056 has shown that
   when used in its anycast mode, the mechanism is unsuitable for
   widespread deployment and use in the Internet.  This document
   therefore requests that RFC 3068, "An Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay
   Routers", be made obsolete and moved to historic status.  It also
   obsoletes RFC 6732 "6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels".  It recommends
   that future products should not support 6to4 anycast and that
   existing deployments should be reviewed.  This complements the
   guidelines in RFC 6343.

1.  Introduction

   The original form of the 6to4 transition mechanism [RFC3056] relies
   on unicast addressing.  However, its extension specified in "An
   Anycast Prefix for 6to4 Relay Routers" [RFC3068] has been shown to
   have severe practical problems when used in the Internet.  This
   document requests that RFC 3068 and RFC 6732 be moved to Historic
   status as defined in section 4.2.4 of [RFC2026].  It complements the
   deployment guidelines in [RFC6343].

   6to4 was designed to help transition the Internet from IPv4 to IPv6.
   It has been a good mechanism for experimenting with IPv6, but because
   of the high failure rates seen with anycast 6to4 [HUSTON], end users
   may end up disabling IPv6 on hosts as a result, and in the past some
   content providers were reluctant to make content available over IPv6
   for this reason.

   [RFC6343] analyses the known operational issues in detail and
   describes a set of suggestions to improve 6to4 reliability, given the
   widespread presence of hosts and customer premises equipment that
   support it.  The advice to disable 6to4 by default has been widely
   adopted in recent operating systems, and the failure modes have been
   widely hidden from users by many browsers adopting the "Happy
   Eyeballs" approach [RFC6555].

   Nevertheless, a measurable amount of 6to4 traffic is still observed
   by IPv6 content providers.  The remaining successful users of anycast
   6to4 are likely to be on hosts using the obsolete policy table
   [RFC3484], which prefers 6to4 above IPv4, and running without Happy
   Eyeballs.  Furthermore, they must have a route to an operational
   anycast relay and they must be accessing an IPv6 host that has a
   route to an operational return relay.

   However, experience shows that operational failures caused by anycast
   6to4 have continued, despite the advice in RFC 6343 being available.

1.1.  Related Work

   IPv6 Rapid Deployment on IPv4 Infrastructures (6rd) [RFC5969]
   explicitly builds on the 6to4 mechanism, using a service provider
   prefix instead of 2002::/16.  However, the deployment model is based
   on service provider support, such that 6rd avoids the problems
   observed with anycast 6to4.

   The framework for 6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels [RFC6732] is intended
   to help a service provider manage 6to4 anycast tunnels.  This
   framework only exists because of the problems observed with anycast
   6to4.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC
   2119 [RFC2119].

   The word "deprecate" and its derivatives are used only in their
   generic sense of "criticize or express disapproval" and do not have
   any specific normative meaning.  A deprecated function might exist in
   the Internet for many years to allow backwards compatibility.

3.  6to4 operational problems

   6to4 is a mechanism designed to allow isolated IPv6 islands to reach
   each other using IPv6 over IPv4 automatic tunneling.  To reach the
   native IPv6 Internet the mechanism uses relay routers both in the
   forward and reverse direction.  The mechanism is supported in many
   IPv6 implementations.  With the increased deployment of IPv6, the
   mechanism has been shown to have a number of shortcomings.

   In the forward direction a 6to4 node will send IPv4 encapsulated IPv6
   traffic to a 6to4 relay, that is connected both to the 6to4 cloud and
   to native IPv6.  In the reverse direction a 2002::/16 route is



Troan & Carpenter        Expires August 1, 2015                 [Page 3]

Internet-Draft          Deprecating 6to4 Anycast            January 2015


   injected into the native IPv6 routing domain to attract traffic from
   native IPv6 nodes to a 6to4 relay router.  It is expected that
   traffic will use different relays in the forward and reverse
   direction.

   One model of 6to4 deployment, described in section 5.2 of RFC 3056,
   suggests that a 6to4 router should have a set of managed connections
   (via BGP connections) to a set of 6to4 relay routers.  While this
   makes the forward path more controlled, it does not guarantee a
   functional reverse path.  In any case this model has the same
   operational burden as manually configured tunnels and has seen no
   deployment in the public Internet.

   RFC 3068 adds an extension that allows the use of a well known IPv4
   anycast address to reach the nearest 6to4 relay in the forward
   direction.  However, this anycast mechanism has a number of
   operational issues and problems, which are described in detail in
   Section 3 of [RFC6343].  This document is intended to deprecate the
   anycast mechanism.

   Peer-to-peer usage of the 6to4 mechanism exists in the Internet,
   likely unknown to many operators.  This usage is harmless to third
   parties and is not dependent on the anycast 6to4 mechanism that this
   document deprecates.

4.  Deprecation

   This document formally deprecates the anycast 6to4 transition
   mechanism defined in [RFC3068] and the associated anycast IPv4
   address 192.88.99.1.  It is no longer considered to be a useful
   service of last resort.

   The prefix 192.88.99.0/24 MUST NOT be reassigned for other use except
   by a future IETF standards action.

   The basic unicast 6to4 mechanism defined in [RFC3056] and the
   associated 6to4 IPv6 prefix 2002::/16 are not deprecated.  The
   default address selection rules specified in [RFC6724] are not
   modified.

   In the absence of 6to4 anycast, 6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels
   [RFC6732] will no longer be necessary, so they are also deprecated by
   this document.

   Incidental references to 6to4 should be reviewed and possibly removed
   from other IETF documents if and when they are updated.  These
   documents include RFC3162, RFC3178, RFC3790, RFC4191, RFC4213,

Internet-Draft          Deprecating 6to4 Anycast            January 2015


   RFC4389, RFC4779, RFC4852, RFC4891, RFC4903, RFC5157, RFC5245,
   RFC5375, RFC5971, RFC6071 and RFC6890.

5.  Implementation Recommendations

   It is NOT RECOMMENDED to include the anycast 6to4 transition
   mechanism in new implementations.  If included in any
   implementations, the anycast 6to4 mechanism MUST be disabled by
   default.

   In host implementations, unicast 6to4 MUST also be disabled by
   default.  All hosts using 6to4 MUST support the IPv6 address
   selection policy described in [RFC6724].

   In router implementations, 6to4 MUST be disabled by default.  In
   particular, enabling IPv6 forwarding on a device MUST NOT
   automatically enable 6to4.

6.  Operational Recommendations

   This document does not imply a recommendation for the generalized
   filtering of traffic or routes for 6to4 or even anycast 6to4.  It
   simply recommends against further deployment of the anycast 6to4
   mechanism, calls for current 6to4 deployments to evaluate the
   efficacy of continued use of the anycast 6to4 mechanism, and makes
   recommendations intended to prevent any use of 6to4 from hampering
   broader deployment and use of native IPv6 on the Internet as a whole.

   Networks SHOULD NOT filter out packets whose source address is
   192.88.99.1, because this is normal 6to4 traffic from a 6to4 return
   relay somewhere in the Internet.  This includes ensuring that traffic
   from a local 6to4 return relay with a source address of 192.88.99.1
   is allowed through anti-spoofing filters such as those described in
   [RFC2827] and [RFC3704] or through Unicast Reverse-Path-Forwarding
   (uRPF) checks [RFC5635].

   The guidelines in Section 4 of [RFC6343] remain valid for those who
   choose to continue operating Anycast 6to4 despite its deprecation.

   Current operators of an anycast 6to4 relay with the IPv4 address
   192.88.99.1 SHOULD review the information in [RFC6343] and the
   present document, and then consider carefully whether the anycast
   relay can be discontinued as traffic diminishes.  Internet service
   providers that do not operate an anycast relay but do provide their
   customers with a route to 192.88.99.1 SHOULD verify that it does in
   fact lead to an operational anycast relay, as discussed in
   Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6343].  Furthermore, Internet service providers
   and other network providers MUST NOT originate a route to

Internet-Draft          Deprecating 6to4 Anycast            January 2015


   192.88.99.1, unless they actively operate and monitor an anycast 6to4
   relay service as detailed in Section 4.2.1 of [RFC6343].

   Operators of a 6to4 return relay responding to the IPv6 prefix
   2002::/16 SHOULD review the information in [RFC6343] and the present
   document, and then consider carefully whether the return relay can be
   discontinued as traffic diminishes.  To avoid confusion, note that
   nothing in the design of 6to4 assumes or requires that return packets
   are handled by the same relay as outbound packets.  As discussed in
   Section 4.5 of RFC 6343, content providers might choose to continue
   operating a return relay for the benefit of their own residual 6to4
   clients.  Internet service providers SHOULD announce the IPv6 prefix
   2002::/16 to their own customers if and only if it leads to a
   correctly operating return relay as described in RFC 6343.  IPv6-only
   service providers, including those operating a NAT64 service
   [RFC6146], are advised that their own customers need a route to such
   a relay in case a residual 6to4 user served by a different service
   provider attempts to communicate with them.

   Operators of 6to4 Provider Managed Tunnels [RFC6732] SHOULD carefully
   consider when this service can be discontinued as traffic diminishes.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The document creating the IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry
   [RFC6890] included the 6to4 relay anycast prefix (192.88.99.0/24) as
   Table 10.  Instead, IANA is requested to mark the 192.88.99.0/24
   prefix originally defined by [RFC3068] as "Deprecated (6to4 Relay
   Anycast)", pointing to the present document.  Redelegation of this
   prefix for any usage requires justification via an IETF Standards
   Action [RFC5226].

8.  Security Considerations

   There are no new security considerations pertaining to this document.
   General security issues with tunnels are listed in [RFC6169] and more
   specifically to 6to4 in [RFC3964] and [RFC6324].
