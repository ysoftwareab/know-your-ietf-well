                    EST over secure CoAP (EST-coaps)
                       draft-ietf-ace-coap-est-01

Abstract

   Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) is used as a certificate
   provisioning protocol over HTTPS.  Low-resource devices often use the
   lightweight Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for message
   exchanges.  This document defines how to transport EST payloads over
   secure CoAP (EST-coaps), which allows low-resource constrained
   devices to use existing EST functionality for provisioning
   certificates.

1.  Introduction

   "Classical" Enrollment over Secure Transport (EST) [RFC7030] is used
   for authenticated/authorized endpoint certificate enrollment (and
   optionally key provisioning) through a Certificate Authority (CA) or
   Registration Authority (RA).  EST messages run over HTTPS.

   This document defines a new transport for EST based on the
   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) since some Internet of Things
   (IoT) devices use CoAP instead of HTTP.  Therefore, this
   specification utilizes DTLS [RFC6347], CoAP [RFC7252], and UDP
   instead of TLS [RFC5246], HTTP [RFC7230] and TCP.

   EST messages may be relatively large and for this reason this
   document also uses CoAP Block-Wise Transfer [RFC7959] to offer a
   fragmentation mechanism of EST messages at the CoAP layer.  COAP
   Observe options [RFC7641] are also used to convey delayed EST
   responses to clients.

   This specification also profiles the use of EST to only support
   certificate-based client Authentication.  HTTP Basic or Digest
   authentication (as described in Section 3.2.3 of [RFC7030] are not
   supported.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   Many of the concepts in this document are taken over from [RFC7030].
   Consequently, much text is directly traceable to [RFC7030].  The same
   document structure is followed to point out the differences and
   commonalities between EST and EST-coaps.

3.  Conformance to RFC7925 profiles

   This section shows how EST-coaps fits into the profiles of low-
   resource devices described in [RFC7925].

   EST-coaps can transport certificates and private keys.  Certificates
   are responses to (re-)enrollment requests or request for a trusted
   certificate list.  Private keys can be transported as responses to a

   request to a server-side keygeneration as described in section 4.4 of
   [RFC7030] and discussed in Section 4.5 of this document.

   The mandatory cipher suite for DTLS in EST-coaps is
   TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CCM_8 defined in [RFC7251] which is the
   mandatory-to-implement cipher suite in CoAP.  Additionally, the curve
   secp256r1 MUST be supported [RFC4492]; this curve is equivalent to
   the NIST P-256 curve.  [Q-EDNOTE: the NIST P-256 curve is a MUST-
   according to the terminology of RFC8247, and Curve25519 is a
   SHOULD+].

   DTLS1.2 implementations MUST use the Supported Elliptic Curves and
   Supported Point Formats Extensions [RFC4492].  Uncompressed point
   format MUST also be supported.  [RFC6090] can be used as summary of
   the ECC algorithms.  DTLS 1.3 implementations differ from DTLS 1.2
   because they do not support point format negotiation in favor of a
   single point format for each curve and thus support for DTLS 1.3 does
   not mandate point formation extensions and negotiation.

   The EST-coaps client MUST be configured with at least an implicit TA
   database from its manufacturer.  The authentication of the EST-coaps
   server by the EST-coaps client is based on certificate authentication
   in the DTLS handshake.

   The authentication of the EST-coaps client is based on a client
   certificate in the DTLS handshake.  This can either be

   o  a previously issued client certificate (e.g., an existing
      certificate issued by the EST CA); this could be a common case for
      simple re-enrollment of clients;

   o  a previously installed certificate (e.g., manufacturer-installed
      certificate or a certificate issued by some other party); the
      server is expected to trust the manufacturer's root CA certificate
      in this case.

4.  Protocol Design

   EST-coaps uses CoAP to transfer EST messages, aided by Block-Wise
   Transfer [RFC7959] to transport CoAP messages in blocks thus avoiding
   (excessive) fragmentation of UDP datagrams.  The use of "Block" for
   the transfer of larger EST messages is specified in Section 4.6.  The
   Figure 1 below shows the layered EST-coaps architecture.

                    Figure 1: EST-coaps protocol layers

   The EST-coaps protocol design follows closely the EST design.  The
   actions supported by EST-coaps are identified by their message types:

   o  CA certificate retrieval, needed to receive the complete set of CA
      certificates.

   o  Simple enroll and reenroll, for CA to sign public client-identity
      key.

   o  Certificate Signing Request (CSR) Attributes request messages,
      informs the client of the fields to include in generated CSR.

   o  Server-side key generation messages, to provide a private client-
      identity key when the client choses for an external entity to
      generate its private key.

4.1.  Payload format

   The content-format (media type equivalent) of the CoAP message
   determines which EST message is transported in the CoAP payload.  The
   media types specified in the HTTP Content-Type header (section 3.2.2
   of [RFC7030]) are in EST-coaps specified by the Content-Format Option
   (12) of CoAP.  The combination of URI path and content-format used
   for CoAP MUST map to an allowed combination of URI and media type as
   defined for EST.  The required content-formats for these requests and
   response messages are defined in Section 9.  The CoAP response codes
   are defined in Section 4.3.

   EST-coaps is designed for use between low-resource devices and hence
   does not need to send base64-encoded data.  Simple binary is more
   efficient (30% smaller payload) and well supported by CoAP.
   Therefore, the content formats specification in Section 9 specifies
   that the binary payload is transported as a CBOR major type 2, a byte
   string, for all EST-coaps Content-Formats.  In the examples of
   Appendix A, the base16 diagnostic notation is used for CBOR major
   type 2, where h'450aafbb' represents an example binary payload.

4.2.  Message Bindings

   The general EST CoAP message characteristics are:

   o  All EST-coaps messages expect a response from the server, thus the
      client MUST send the requests over confirmable CON COAP messages.

   o  The Ver, TKL, Token, and Message ID values of the CoAP header are
      not affected by EST.

   o  The CoAP options used are Uri-Host, Uri-Path, Uri-Port, Content-
      Format, and Location-Path in CoAP.  These CoAP Options are used to
      communicate the HTTP fields specified in the EST REST messages.

   o  EST URLs are HTTPS based (https://), in CoAP these will be assumed
      to be transformed to coaps (coaps://)

   Appendix A includes some practical examples of EST messages
   translated to CoAP.

4.3.  CoAP response codes

   Section 5.9 of [RFC7252] specifies the mapping of HTTP response codes
   to CoAP response codes.  Every time the HTTP response code 200 is
   specified in [RFC7030] in response to a GET request, in EST-coaps the
   equivalent CoAP response code 2.05 or 2.03 MUST be used.  Similarly,
   2.01, 2.02 or 2.04 MUST be used in response to POST EST requests.
   Response code HTTP 202 has no equivalent in CoAP.  In Section 4.4 it
   is specified how EST requests over CoAP handle delayed messages.

   All other HTTP 2xx response codes are not used by EST.  For the
   following HTTP 4xx error codes that may occur: 400, 401, 403, 404,
   405, 406, 412, 413, 415; the equivalent CoAP response code for EST-
   coaps is 4.xx.  For the HTTP 5xx error codes: 500, 501, 502, 503, 504
   the equivalent CoAP response code is 5.xx.

4.4.  Delayed Results

   It is possible that responses are not always directly available by
   the server, and may even require manual intervention to generate the
   certificate for the server response.  Delays of minutes to hours are
   possible.  Therefore, each GET request MUST be accompanied by the
   observe option.  When the result is directly available, the client
   receives the result and forgets about the observe as specified in
   section 3.6 of [RFC7641].  When a POST response is delayed, the POST
   returns a 2.01 (Created) response code, having put a value in the
   Location-Path option.  After reception of 2.01 the client does a GET
   request with the observe option to the newly returned location.  Once

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                      June 2018


   the delayed result is notified by the server, the client forgets
   about the observe.

   Next to the observe option the server MUST specify the Max-Age option
   that indicates the maximum waiting time in minutes.

4.5.  Server-side Key Generation

   Constrained devices sometimes do not have the necessary hardware to
   generate statistically random numbers for private keys and DTLS
   ephemeral keys.  Past experience has shown that low-resource
   endpoints sometimes generate numbers which could allow someone to
   decrypt the communication or guess the private key and impersonate as
   the device.  Studies have shown that the same keys are generated by
   the same model devices deployed on-line.

   Additionally, random number key generation is costly, thus energy
   draining.  Even though the random numbers that constitute the
   identity/cert do not get generated often, an endpoint may not want to
   spend time and energy generating keypairs, and just ask for one from
   the server.

   In these scenarios, server-side key generation can be used.  The
   client asks for the server or proxy to generate the private key and
   the certificate which is transferred back to the client in the
   server-side key generation response.

   [RFC7030] recommends for the private key returned by the server to be
   encrypted.  The specification provides two methods to encrypt the
   generated key, symmetric and asymmetric.  The methods are signalled
   by the client by using the relevant attributes (SMIMECapabilities and
   DecryptKeyIdentifier or AsymmetricDecryptKeyIdentifier) in the CSR
   request.  In the symmetric key case, the key can be established out-
   of-band or alternatively derived by the established TLS connection as
   described in [RFC5705].

   The sever-side key generation response is returned using a CBOR array
   Section 9.2.1.  The certificate part exactly matches the response
   from a enrollment response.  The private key is placed inside of a
   CMS SignedData.  The SignedData is signed by the party that generated
   the private key, which may or may not be the EST server or the EST
   CA.  The SignedData is further protected by placing it inside of a
   CMS EnvelopedData as explained in Section 4.4.2 of [RFC7030].

4.6.  Message fragmentation

   DTLS defines fragmentation only for the handshake part and not for
   secure data exchange (DTLS records).  [RFC6347] states that to avoid
   using IP fragmentation, which involves error-prone datagram
   reconstitution, invokers of the DTLS record layer SHOULD size DTLS
   records so that they fit within any Path MTU estimates obtained from
   the record layer.  In addition, invokers residing on a 6LoWPAN over
   IEEE 802.15.4 network SHOULD attempt to size CoAP messages such that
   each DTLS record will fit within one or two IEEE 802.15.4 frames.

   That is not always possible.  Even though ECC certificates are small
   in size, they can vary greatly based on signature algorithms, key
   sizes, and OID fields used.  For 256-bit curves, common ECDSA cert
   sizes are 500-1000 bytes which could fluctuate further based on the
   algorithms, OIDs, SANs and cert fields.  For 384-bit curves, ECDSA
   certs increase in size and can sometimes reach 1.5KB.  Additionally,
   there are times when the EST cacerts response from the server can
   include multiple certs that amount to large payloads.  Section 4.6 of
   CoAP [RFC7252] describes the possible payload sizes: "if nothing is
   known about the size of the headers, good upper bounds are 1152 bytes
   for the message size and 1024 bytes for the payload size".
   Section 4.6 of [RFC7252] also suggests that IPv4 implementations may
   want to limit themselves to more conservative IPv4 datagram sizes
   such as 576 bytes.  From [RFC0791] follows that the absolute minimum
   value of the IP MTU for IPv4 is as low as 68 bytes, which would leave
   only 40 bytes minus security overhead for a UDP payload.  Thus, even
   with ECC certs, EST-coaps messages can still exceed sizes in MTU of
   1280 for IPv6 or 60-80 bytes for 6LoWPAN [RFC4919] as explained in
   section 2 of [RFC7959].  EST-coaps needs to be able to fragment EST
   messages into multiple DTLS datagrams.  Fine-grained fragmentation of
   EST messages is essential.

   To perform fragmentation in CoAP, [RFC7959] specifies the "Block1"
   option for fragmentation of the request payload and the "Block2"
   option for fragmentation of the return payload of a CoAP flow.

   The BLOCK draft defines SZX in the Block1 and Block2 option fields.
   These are used to convey the size of the blocks in the requests or
   responses.

   The CoAP client MAY specify the Block1 size and MAY also specify the
   Block2 size.  The CoAP server MAY specify the Block2 size, but not
   the Block1 size.  As explained in Section 1 of [RFC7959]), blockwise
   transfers SHOULD be used in Confirmable CoAP messages to avoid the
   exacerbation of lost blocks.

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                      June 2018


   The Size1 response MAY be parsed by the client as a size indication
   of the Block2 resource in the server response or by the server as a
   request for a size estimate by the client.  Similarly, Size2 option
   defined in BLOCK should be parsed by the server as an indication of
   the size of the resource carried in Block1 options and by the client
   as a maximum size expected in the 4.13 (Request Entity Too Large)
   response to a request.

   Examples of fragmented messages are shown in Appendix B.

4.7.  Deployment limits

   Although EST-coaps paves the way for the utilization of EST for
   constrained devices on constrained networks, some devices will not
   have enough resources to handle the large payloads that come with
   EST-coaps.  The specification of EST-coaps is intended to ensure that
   EST works for networks of constrained devices that choose to limit
   their communications stack to UDP/CoAP.  It is up to the network
   designer to decide which devices execute the EST protocol and which
   do not.

5.  Discovery and URI

   EST-coaps is targeted to low-resource networks with small packets.
   Saving header space is important and an additional EST-coaps URI is
   specified that is shorter than the EST URI.

   In the context of CoAP, the presence and location of (path to) the
   management data are discovered by sending a GET request to "/.well-
   known/core" including a resource type (RT) parameter with the value
   "ace.est" [RFC6690].  Upon success, the return payload will contain
   the root resource of the EST resources.  It is up to the
   implementation to choose its root resource; throughout this document
   the example root resource /est is used.

   The individual EST-coaps server URIs differ from the EST URI by
   replacing the scheme https by coaps and by specifying shorter
   resource path names:

   coaps://www.example.com/.well-known/est/ArbitraryLabel/<short-est>.

   The ArbitraryLabel Path-Segment SHOULD be of the shortest length
   possible.

   Figure 5 in section 3.2.2 of [RFC7030] enumerates the operations and
   corresponding paths which are supported by EST.  Table 1 provides the
   mapping from the EST URI path to the shorter EST-coaps URI path.

   The short resource URIs MUST be supported.  The corresponding longer
   URIs specified in [RFC7030] MAY be supported.

   When discovering the root path for the EST resources, the server MAY
   return all available resource paths and the used content types.  This
   is useful when multiple content types are specified for EST-coaps
   server.  The example below shows the discovery of the presence and
   location of management data.

     REQ: GET /.well-known/core?rt=ace.est

     RES: 2.05 Content
   </est>; rt="ace.est"

   </est/sen>;ct=TBD2 TBD7
   </est/sren>;ct=TBD2 TBD7
   </est/att>;ct=TBD6
   </est/skg>;ct=TBD1 TBD7 TBD8

   The first line of the discovery response MUST be returned.  The five
   consecutive lines MAY be returned.  The return of the content-types
   in the last four lines allows the client to choose the most
   appropriate one from multiple content types.

6.  DTLS Transport Protocol

   EST-coaps depends on a secure transport mechanism over UDP that can
   secure (confidentiality, authenticity) the exchanged CoAP messages.

   DTLS is one such secure protocol.  When "TLS" is referred to in the
   context of EST, it is understood that in EST-coaps, security is
   provided using DTLS instead.  No other changes are necessary (all
   provisional modes etc. are the same as for TLS).

   CoAP was designed to avoid fragmentation.  DTLS is used to secure
   CoAP messages.  However, fragmentation is still possible at the DTLS



van der Stok, et al.    Expires December 8, 2018               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                      June 2018


   layer during the DTLS handshake when using ECC ciphersuites.  If
   fragmentation is necessary, "DTLS provides a mechanism for
   fragmenting a handshake message over several records, each of which
   can be transmitted separately, thus avoiding IP fragmentation"
   [RFC6347].

   CoAP and DTLS can provide proof of identity for EST-coaps clients and
   server with simple PKI messages conformant to section 3.1 of
   [RFC5272].  EST-coaps supports the certificate types and Trust
   Anchors (TA) that are specified for EST in section 3 of [RFC7030].

   Channel-binding information for linking proof-of-identity with
   connection-based proof-of-possession is optional for EST-coaps.  When
   proof-of-possession is desired, a set of actions are required
   regarding the use of tls-unique, described in section 3.5 in
   [RFC7030].  The tls-unique information translates to the contents of
   the first "Finished" message in the (D)TLS handshake between server
   and client [RFC5929].  The client is then supposed to add this
   "Finished" message as a ChallengePassword in the attributes section
   of the PKCS#10 Request Info to prove that the client is indeed in
   control of the private key at the time of the TLS session when
   performing a /simpleenroll, for example.  In the case of EST-coaps,
   the same operations can be performed during the DTLS handshake.  For
   DTLS 1.2, in the event of handshake message fragmentation, the Hash
   of the handshake messages used in the MAC calculation of the Finished
   message

   PRF(master_secret, finished_label, Hash(handshake_messages))
      [0..verify_data_length-1];

   MUST be computed as if each handshake message had been sent as a
   single fragment [RFC6347].  Similarly, for DTLS 1.3, the Finished
   message

   HMAC(finished_key,
       Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context,
       Certificate*, CertificateVerify*))

       * Only included if present.

   MUST be computed as if each handshake message had been sent as a
   single fragment following the algorithm described in 4.4.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13].

   In a constrained CoAP environment, endpoints can't afford to
   establish a DTLS connection for every EST transaction.
   Authenticating and negotiating DTLS keys requires resources on low-
   end endpoints and consumes valuable bandwidth.  The DTLS connection



van der Stok, et al.    Expires December 8, 2018               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                      June 2018


   SHOULD remain open for persistent EST connections.  For example, an
   EST cacerts request that is followed by a simpleenroll request can
   use the same authenticated DTLS connection.  Given that after a
   successful enrollment, it is more likely that a new EST transaction
   will take place after a significant amount of time, the DTLS
   connections SHOULD only be kept alive for EST messages that are
   relatively close to each other.  In some cases, such as NAT
   rebinding, keeping the state of a connection is not possible when
   devices sleep for extended periods of time.  In such occasions,
   [I-D.rescorla-tls-dtls-connection-id] negotiates a connection ID that
   can eliminate the need for new handshake and its additional cost.

   Support for Observe CoAP options [RFC7641] is compulsory.  The
   necessity of Observer for long delays (minutes - hours)is explained
   in Section 4.4.  Observe options could also be used by the server to
   notify clients about a change in the cacerts or csr attributes
   (resources) and might be an area of future work.

7.  HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar

   In real-world deployments, the EST server will not always reside
   within the CoAP boundary.  The EST-server can exist outside the
   constrained network in a non-constrained network that supports TLS/
   HTTP.  In such environments EST-coaps is used by the client within
   the CoAP boundary and TLS is used to transport the EST messages
   outside the CoAP boundary.  A Registrar at the edge is required to
   operate between the CoAP environment and the external HTTP network.
   The EST coaps-to-HTTPS Registrar MUST terminate EST-coaps and
   authenticate the client downstream and initiate EST connections over
   TLS upstream.

   The Registrar SHOULD authenticate the client downstream and it should
   be authenticated by the EST server or CA upstream.  The Registration
   Authority (re-)creates the secure connection from DTLS to TLS and
   vice versa.  A trust relationship SHOULD be pre-established between
   the Registrar and the EST servers to be able to proxy these
   connections on behalf of various clients.

   When enforcing Proof-of-Possession (POP), the (D)TLS tls-unique value
   of the (D)TLS session needs to be used to prove that the private key
   corresponding to the public key is in the possession of and can be
   used by an end-entity or client.  In other words, the CSR the client
   is using needs to include information from the DTLS connection the
   client establishes with the server.  In EST, that information is the
   (D)TLS tls-unique value of the (D)TLS session.  In the presence of
   ESTcoaps-to-HTTPS Registrar, the EST-coaps client MUST be
   authenticated and authorized by the Registrar and the Registrar MUST
   be authenticated as an EST Registrar client to the EST server.  Thus

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                      June 2018


   the POP information is lost between the EST-coaps client and the EST
   server.  The EST server becomes aware of the presence of an EST
   Registrar from its TLS client certificate that includes id-kp-cmcRA
   [RFC6402] extended key usage extension.  As explained in Section 3.7
   of [RFC7030], the EST server SHOULD apply an authorization policy
   consistent with a Registrar client.  For example, it could be
   configured to accept POP linking information that does not match the
   current TLS session because the authenticated EST client Registrar
   has verified this information when acting as an EST server.

   One possible use-case, shown in one figure below, is expected to be
   deployed in practice:

                                        Constrained Network

                                    |'--------------------------'|
                                    '----------------------------'

             ESTcoaps-to-HTTPS Registrar at the CoAP boundary.

   Table 1 contains the URI mapping between the EST-coaps and EST the
   Registrar SHOULD adhere to.  Section 7 of [RFC8075] and Section 4.3
   define the mapping between EST-coaps and HTTP response codes, that
   determines how the Registrar translates CoAP response codes from/to
   HTTP status codes.  The mapping from Content-Type to media type is
   defined in Section 9.  The conversion from CBOR major type 2 to
   base64 encoding needs to be done in the Registrar.  Conversion is
   possible because a TLS link exists between EST-coaps-to-HTTP
   Registrar and EST server and a corresponding DTLS link exists between
   EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar and EST client.

   Due to fragmentation of large messages into blocks, an EST-coaps-to-
   HTTP Registrar SHOULD reassemble the BLOCKs before translating the
   binary content to Base-64, and consecutively relay the message
   upstream.

   For the discovery of the EST server by the EST client in the coap
   environment, the EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar MUST announce itself
   according to the rules of Section 5.  The available actions of the
   Registrars MUST be announced with as many resource paths.  The

   discovery of EST server in the http environment follow the rules
   specified in [RFC7030].

   When server-side key generation is used, if the private key is
   protected using symmetric keys then the Registrar needs to encrypt
   the private key down to the client with one symmetric key and decrypt
   it from the server with another.  If no private key encryption takes
   place the Registrar will be able to see the key as it establishes a
   separate connection to the server.  In the case of asymmetrically
   encrypted private key, the Registrar may not be able to decrypt it if
   the server encrypted it with a public key that corresponds to a
   private key that belongs to the client.

8.  Parameters

   [EDNOTE: This section to be populated.  It will address transmission
   parameters described in sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the CoAP draft.  EST
   does not impose any unique parameters that affect the CoAP parameters
   in Table 2 and 3 in the CoAP draft but the ones in CoAP could be
   affecting EST.  For example, the processing delay of CAs could be
   less then 2s, but in this case they should send a CoAP ACK every 2s
   while processing.]

   A representation with content format ID TBD8 contains a collection of
   representations along with their respective content format.

   The collection is encoded as a CBOR array [RFC7049] with an even
   number of elements.  The second, fourth, sixth, etc. element is a
   binary string containing a representation.  The first, third, fifth,
   etc. element is an unsigned integer specifying the content format ID
   of the following representation.

   For example, a collection containing two representations, one with
   content format ID TBD5 and one with content format ID TBD2, looks
   like this in diagnostic CBOR notation:
   [TBD5,h'0123456789abcdef',TBD2,h'fedcba9876543210'].  An example is
   shown in Appendix A.4.

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  EST server considerations

   The security considerations of Section 6 of [RFC7030] are only
   partially valid for the purposes of this document.  As HTTP Basic
   Authentication is not supported, the considerations expressed for
   using passwords do not apply.

   Given that the client has only limited resources and may not be able
   to generate sufficiently random keys to encrypt its identity, it is
   possible that the client uses server generated private/public keys to
   encrypt its certificate.  The transport of these keys is inherently
   risky.  A full probability analysis MUST be done to establish whether
   server side key generation enhances or decreases the probability of
   identity stealing.

   When a client uses the Implicit TA database for certificate
   validation, the client cannot verify that the implicit database can
   act as an RA.  It is RECOMMENDED that such clients include "Linking
   Identity and POP Information" Section 6 in requests (to prevent such
   requests from being forwarded to a real EST server by a man in the
   middle).  It is RECOMMENDED that the Implicit Trust Anchor database
   used for EST server authentication be carefully managed to reduce the
   chance of a third-party CA with poor certification practices from
   being trusted.  Disabling the Implicit Trust Anchor database after
   successfully receiving the Distribution of CA certificates response
   (Section 4.1.3 of [RFC7030]) limits any risk to the first DTLS
   exchange.

   In accordance with [RFC7030], TLS cipher suites that include
   "_EXPORT_" and "_DES_" in their names MUST NOT be used.  More
   information about recommendations of TLS and DTLS are included in
   [RFC7525].

   As described in CMC, Section 6.7 of [RFC5272], "For keys that can be
   used as signature keys, signing the certification request with the
   private key serves as a POP on that key pair".  The inclusion of tls-
   unique in the certification request links the proof-of-possession to
   the TLS proof-of-identity.  This implies but does not prove that the
   authenticated client currently has access to the private key.

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                      June 2018


   Regarding the Certificate Signing Request (CSR), an adversary could
   exclude attributes that a server may want, include attributes that a
   server may not want, and render meaningless other attributes that a
   server may want.  The CA is expected to be able to enforce policies
   to recover from improper CSR requests.

   Interpreters of ASN.1 structures should be aware of the use of
   invalid ASN.1 length fields and should take appropriate measures to
   guard against buffer overflows, stack overruns in particular, and
   malicious content in general.

10.2.  HTTPS-CoAPS Registrar considerations

   The Registrar proposed in Section 7 must be deployed with care, and
   only when the recommended connections are impossible.  When POP is
   used the Registrar terminating the TLS connection establishes a new
   one with the upstream CA.  Thus, it is impossible for POP to be
   enforced throughout the EST transaction.  The EST server could be
   configured to accept POP linking information that does not match the
   current TLS session because the authenticated EST Registrar client
   has verified this information when acting as an EST server.  The
   introduction of an EST-coaps-to-HTTP Registrar assumes the client can
   trust the registrar using its implicit or explicit TA database.  It
   also assumes the Registrar has a trust relationship with the upstream
   EST server in order to act on behalf of the clients.

   In a server-side key generation case, depending on the private key
   encryption method, the Registrar may be able see the private key as
   it acts as a man-in-the-middle.  Thus, the clients puts its trust on
   the Registrar not exposing the private key.

   For some use cases, clients that leverage server-side key generation
   might prefer for the enrolled keys to be generated by the Registrar
   if the CA does not support server-side key generation.  In these
   cases the Registrar must support the random number generation using
   proper entropy.  Since the client has no knowledge if the Registrar
   will be generating the keys and enrolling the certificates with the
   CA or if the CA will be responsible for generating the keys, the
   existence of a Registrar requires the client to put its trust on the
   registrar doing the right thing if it is generating they private
   keys.

Appendix A.  EST messages to EST-coaps

   This section takes all examples from Appendix A of [RFC7030], changes
   the payload from Base64 to binary and replaces the http headers by
   their CoAP equivalents.

   The corresponding CoAP headers are only shown in Appendix A.1.
   Creating CoAP headers are assumed to be generally known.

   Binary payload is a CBOR major type 2 (byte array), that is shown
   with a base16 (hexadecimal) CBOR diagnostic notation.

   [EDNOTE: The payloads of the examples need to be re-generated with
   appropriate tools and example certificates.]

A.1.  cacerts

   These examples assume that the resource discovery, returned a short
   URL of "/est".

   In EST-coaps, a coaps cacerts IPv4 message can be:

   GET coaps://192.0.2.1:8085/est/crts

   The corresponding CoAP header fields are shown below.  The use of
   block and DTLS are worked out in Appendix B.

   After reception of the 2.05 response, the client can forget the
   observe.

A.2.  csrattrs

   In the following valid /csrattrs exchange, the EST-coaps client
   authenticates itself with a certificate issued by the connected CA.

   The initial DTLS handshake is identical to the enrollment example.
   The IPv6 CoAP GET request looks like:

   REQ:
   GET coaps://[2001:db8::2:1]:61616/est/att
   (Content-Format: TBD6)(observe =0)(Max-Age =1)

Internet-Draft                  EST-coaps                      June 2018


   A 2.05 Content response contains attributes which are relevant for
   the authenticated client.  In this example, the EST-coaps server
   returns two attributes that the client can ignore when they are
   unknown to him.

A.3.  enroll / reenroll

   During the Enroll/Reenroll exchange, the EST-coaps client uses a CSR
   (Content-Format TBD7) request in the POST request payload.

   After verification of the CSR by the server, a 2.05 Content response
   with the issued certificate will be returned to the client.  As
   described in Section 4.4, if the server is not able to provide a
   response, then it ACKs the GET (with no payload), and the payload
   will be sent later as part of the OBSERVE processing.

   [EDNOTE: When redoing this example, given that proof of possession
   (POP) is also used, make sure it is obvious that the
   ChallengePassword attribute in the CSR is valid HMAC output.  HMAC-
   REAL.]

   The same example when delays occur (omitting the payloads in the
   examples) has a different behavior.  The response to the POST is an
   empty payload with response code 2.01 (Created) that also returns the
   resource to query.  The client issues a GET with an observe and a new
   token value, and waits for the notification after possibly receiving
   an empty payload first.

   POST [2001:db8::2:1]:61616/est/sen
   (token 0x45)(observe = 0)
   (Content-Format: TBD7)(Max-Age=120)
   [payload]
   RET:
   (token =0x45)(observe =12)(Location-Path=/est/1245)

   GET [2001:db8::2:1]:61616/est/1245

A.4.  serverkeygen

   During this valid /serverkeygen exchange, the EST-coaps client
   authenticates itself using the certificate provided by the connected
   CA.

   The initial DTLS handshake is identical to the enrollment example.
   The CoAP GET request looks like:

   [EDNOTE: same comment as HMAC-REAL above applies.]

   [EDNOTE: Suggestion to have only one example with complete encrypted
   payload (the short one) and point out the different fields.  Update
   this example according to the agreed upon solution from Section 4.5.

   Without the DecryptKeyIdentifier attribute, the response has no
   additional encryption beyond DTLS.

   The response contains first a preamble that can be ignored.  The EST-
   coaps server can use the preamble to include additional explanations,
   like ownership or support information

Appendix B.  EST-coaps Block message examples

   This section provides a detailed example of the messages using DTLS
   and BLOCK option Block2.  The minimum PMTU is 1280 bytes, which is
   the example value assumed for the DTLS datagram size.  The example
   block length is taken as 64 which gives an SZX value of 2.

   The following is an example of a valid /cacerts exchange over DTLS.
   The content length of the cacerts response in appendix A.1 of

   [RFC7030] is 4246 bytes using base64.  This leads to a length of 2509
   bytes in binary.  The CoAP message adds around 10 bytes, the DTLS
   record 29 bytes.  To avoid IP fragmentation, the CoAP block option is
   used and an MTU of 127 is assumed to stay within one IEEE 802.15.4
   packet.  To stay below the MTU of 127, the payload is split in 39
   packets with a payload of 64 bytes each, followed by a packet of 13
   bytes.  The client sends an IPv6 packet containing the UDP datagram
   with the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP Request 40 times.
   The server returns an IPv6 packet containing the UDP datagram with
   the DTLS record that encapsulates the CoAP response.  The CoAP
   request-response exchange with block option is shown below.  Block
   option is shown in a decomposed way indicating the kind of Block
   option (2 in this case because used in the response) followed by a
   colon, and then the block number (NUM), the more bit (M = 0 means
   last block), and block size exponent (2**(SZX+4)) separated by
   slashes.  The Length 64 is used with SZX= 2 to avoid IP
   fragmentation.  The CoAP Request is sent with confirmable (CON)
   option and the content format of the Response is /application/
   cacerts.

   GET /192.0.2.1:8085/est/crts     -->
