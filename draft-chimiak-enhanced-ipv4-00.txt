Abstract

   This document describes a solution to Internet address depletion
   problem using a clever IPv4 option mechanism as a solution, called
   enhanced IP (EnIP).  Because it is IPv4, it maximizes backward
   compatibility while providing a six order of magnitude increase in
   address space.  Unlike other similar proposals, care was taken to
   avoid costly changes and requirements to the core network and border
   routers, with the exception that options be passed in that equipment
   as described below.  Because it is backward compatible, current IPv4
   software, network equipment, firewalls, intrusion detection/
   protection, and layer 5 firewalls can be maintained until IPv6 system
   information security reaches acceptable maturity and availability.
   In addition, because it is IPv4, the legally and operational
   complexities can be postponed or avoided.

Internet-Draft       IPv4 with 64 bit Address Space         January 2015


1.  Introduction

   For various reasons, there is a large demand for IP addresses.  It
   would be useful to have a unique address for each Internet device to
   allow, if desired, that any device could call another [Lee-2012].
   The Internet of Things would also be able to make use of more
   routable addresses if they were available.  Currently, this is not
   possible with IPv4.  IPv6 has presented a potential solution to this
   problem but has faced problems with global adoption.  Carrier Grade
   Network Address Translation and NAT (NAPT) have provided the solution
   thus far.

   Enhanced IP (EnIP) was designed to minimize impact on core and border
   routers.  DHCP, ARP, and existing IPv4 routing protocols are
   compatible with EnIP.  By leveraging private address space in a
   similar manner of IP4+4 [Turanyi-2002], EnIP increases available
   address space by a factor of 17.9 million [Chimiak-2014] or 17.9
   million new addresses for each current routable IP address.

   This could allow the reassignment of small segments of unused address
   blocks in /8 networks to registries with chronic shortages of IP
   addresses.

   EnIP packets carry additional address bits and state in an IP option,
   eliminating routing table updates like IPv6.  EnIP supports end-to-
   end connectivity, a shortcoming of NAT, making it easier to implement
   mobile networks.  Host renumbering is also not required in EnIP as
   has been the case with other 64-bit protocol proposals
   [Turanyi-2002].  This is a major topic of section 4.

   Because current NATs are resource intensive, requiring that state be
   maintained, this paper will call these NATs NATs, The stateless NAT
   used in EnIP will be called an EnIP NAT.

1.1.  Protocol Transitions

   Several transitions in the Internet Protocol suite are discussed in
   the IEEE paper [Chimiak-2014].  These transitions include Network
   Control Program (NCP) to TCP/IP, the evolution of IPv4, and IPv6.  It
   also refers to network address port translation (NAPT), usually
   called NAT [Paul-2014], Nat444 [Shirasaki-2012], Dual-Stack Lite
   [RFC6333], NAT64 [RFC6146] and RFC 6144 [RFC6144].

1.2.  The Use of IP Options

   EnIP uses IP options to increase address space.  Over time, this
   fixed-length IP option would need to be added to the fast path
   implementations available on core routers [Aweya-1999].  Fast path

   implementations are discussed by Hidell et. al.  [Hidell-2014].  Fast
   path allows core routers to optimize data paths to line cards based
   on table lookups.  The fast path does not usually process packets
   containing IP options [Aweya-1999].  As a result, packets containing
   IP options are forwarded to the slow path CPU for processing and
   forwarding to the correct line card.

   However, a very simple upgrade could be made to the core and border
   routers to process EnIP packets in the fast path with the following
   simple pseudo code [Chimiak-2014]:

          if (IgnoreOptions)
                  FastPathOperations();
          else if (IP_Option_Present AND Option_Byte1 == 0X9A)
                  FastPathOperations() ;
          else
                  SlowPathOperations() ;

   EnIP and IPv6 both require upgrades to the fast path implementations
   of routers.  EnIP's fast path upgrade has four advantages:

     (1)  The EnIP upgrade is the pseudo code above, instead of a large
          code base insertion.

     (2)  There is no equipment reconfiguration.

     (3)  Internet providers can independently upgrade their fast paths.

     (4)  Finally, there are no requirements to update the IPv4 routing
          tables.

1.3.  Contents of this Paper

   Section 2 describes EnIP.  Section 3 is the heart of the paper,
   describing the mechanics of EnIP.  Section 4 describes the University
   of Maryland and University of Delaware deployment.  It also describes
   tests between two nodes using EnIP and using normal IPv4 and gives
   the results of the tests.  The final section contains some concluding
   remarks.

2.  Introduction to EnIP (EnIP)

   EnIP increases IP address space while maintaining compatibility with
   existing IPv4 implementations.  Current EnIP implementations use IP
   option 26 to create a twelve byte extension to the IP header.

2.1.  EnIP Addressing Example

   The EnIP extension contains four bytes of overhead, and two four byte
   fields used as additional storage for the EnIP source and destination
   addresses.  EnIP addresses are written as two IPv4 addresses
   concatenated together.  IPv6 and EnIP addressing schemes are shown
   below:

          IPv6 address   2001:0101:c000:0202:0a01:0102::0
          EnIP address   192.0.2.2.10.1.1.2

   In the above EnIP address, 192.0.2.2 is a public IPv4 address called
   the site address; the 10.1.1.2 address is called the host address.
   The host address is always a private IPv4 address assigned to a host
   behind a lightweight, stateless EnIP-enabled NAT.  It is the private
   IPv4 address that identifies the host in the network behind that NAT
   and is compatible with other normal IPv4 hosts.  The site address
   allows the packet to traverse public networks because its IPv4 Source
   Host Number (or source address) is 192.0.2.2, a fully routable IPv4
   address.

2.2.  IPv4 Header with EnIP Option Header

   The IPv4 header supporting EnIP is shown in Figure 1.  It is an IPv4
   header with additional option space used as follows:

3.1.1.  Typical Private IPv4 Host to a Typical Public IPv4 Host using
        NAT

   IP1 (10.1.1.1), a typical IPv4 host, wants to reach N2 (192.0.2.2)
   (See Figure 3).  It uses NAT (as on Linux iptables) to masquerade as
   the public IP address of N1 (192.0.2.1).  N1 sets up a port
   forwarding rule for IP1 for return packets from N2.

3.1.2.  Typical Private IPv4 Host to a Typical Private IPv4 Host using
        NAT

   The same IP1 (10.1.1.1) wants to reach tcp port 80 on IP2 (10.3.3.1),
   another typical IPv4 host (see Figure 4).  The packets from 10.1.1.1
   use NAT on N1 to masquerade as source IP address 192.0.2.1.  At N2
   (192.0.2.2), the packets arrive.  There they have a NAT port
   forwarding rule setup on N2 to map tcp port 80 on 192.0.2.2 to
   forward packets to the internal host IP2 (10.3.3.1).

                                 using NAT

   So packets move from IP1 to N1, taking N1's address as the source
   address and move to N2.  N2 has a mapping to IP2 and sends the packet
   to IP2.  When IP2 sends replies, the NATs used their table entries to
   send the packet back to IP1, adjusting the addresses as necessary.

3.1.3.  Private EnIP Host to a Typical Public IPv4 Host NAT

   Suppose EIP1 (10.1.1.2) wants to reach N2 (192.0.2.2) as in Figure 5.
   It is the same as an IPv4 node wanting to reach N2.  So the
   destination IP address EIP1 s used to communicate with N2
   (192.0.2.2).  The NAT device (N1) uses IPv4 NAT to translate the
   source of the packets to come from 192.0.2.1.  EIP1 behaves as though
   it is an IPv4 host.  It is fully compatible with normal IPv4
   communications.

              It is important to note that thus far this paper

             just compatibility with current IPv4 implementations

3.2.  Enhanced IPv4 Explanation using an Example Figure 7

   Suppose EIP1 wants to send packets to EIP2.  Here both hosts are
   running Enhanced IPv4 stacks and N1 and N2 support EnIP.  Suppose
   EIP1 knows the address of EIP2 is 192.0.2.2.10.3.3.2.  EIP1 knows its
   internal IP address of 10.1.1.2 but is not aware of the external
   address of N1 (192.0.2.1).  The following is done (see Figure 7):

                          Figure 7 - Enhanced IP

3.2.1.  EIP1 constructs the Packet

     (1)  EIP1 sets the Source Host Number field (the source IPv4
          address) to 10.1.1.2;

     (2)  The EnIP ID field is set to 0X9A. the ESP bit is zeroed in the
          EnIP header.

     (3)  The Enhanced Source Address in the EnIP header is set to all
          ones since an EnIP source address is not currently present.

     (4)  The most significant 32 bits of the EnIP address is set by
          storing 192.0.2.2 in the IPv4 Destination Host Number.

     (5)  The least significant 32 bits of the EnIP address is set by
          storing 10.3.3.2 in the EnIP Destination Address field.

     (6)  Finally, EIP1 sets the EDP bit to 1.

3.2.2.  EIP1 Transmits the Packet to N1

   The packet is routed to N1 using normal IPv4.  N1 does the following:

     (1)  It notes the EnIP option (0X9A)is present.

     (2)  N1 reads 10.1.1.2 from the IPv4 Source Host Number field and
          places that in the Enhanced Source Address field.  This field
          no longer contains 255.255.255.255.

     (3)  N1 sets the ESP bit to 1

     (4)  N1 makes 192.0.2.1 the IPv4 Source Host Number.

     (5)  N1 recomputes the IP checksum of the new packet.  If the
          packet carries TCP or UDP, it recomputes these checksums as
          they have also changed.

3.2.3.  Packet Arrives at N2 (192.0.2.2)

   When the packet Arrives at N2, N2 does the following:

     (1)  N2 identifies the packet as an EnIP packet (0X9A).

     (2)  It reads the Enhanced Destination Address, 10.3.3.2, and
          places this value as the IP header's Destination Host Number.

     (3)  N2 zeroes the EDP bit and the Enhanced Destination Address to
          zero.

     (4)  It recomputes the IP checksum.  If the packet carries TCP or
          UDP, recomputes these checksums as they have changed as a
          result of a change to the IP destination address.

     (5)  N2 sends the packet to EIP2.

3.2.4.  EIP2 Receives the Packet

   When the packet arrives at EIP2, EIP2 does the following:

     (1)  It computes the source address of the packet.  The IPv4 Source
          Host Number (192.0.2.1) is concatenated with the Enhanced
          source address (10.1.1.2) The result is 192.0.2.1.10.1.1.2.

     (2)  The IPv4 Destination Host Number (address) is 10.3.3.2.

3.2.5.  EIP2 Transmits a Packet to EIP1

   To construct a packet from EIP2 to EIP1, EIP2 does the following:

     (1)  EIP2 sets the Option ID field to 0X9A.

     (2)  It takes the IPv4 Source Host Number from the incoming packet,
          192.0.2.1, and sets it as the IPv4 Destination Host Number.

     (3)  It places the Enhanced Source Address (10.1.1.2) in the
          Enhanced Destination Address field.

     (4)  EIP2 sets the EDP field to 1 and the IPv4 Source Host Number
          to 10.3.3.2.

     (5)  It sets the Enhanced Source Address to all ones.

     (6)  It sets the ESP bit to 0.

3.2.6.  Packet Arrives at N2

   When the packet Arrives at N2, N2 does the following:

     (1)  It writes 10.3.3.2 in the Enhanced Source Address field.

     (2)  The ESP bit is set to 1.

     (3)  N2 writes 192.0.2.2 in the IPv4 Source Host Number field and
          recomputes the IP checksum.  If the packet carries TCP or UDP,
          it recomputes these checksums as well.

     (4)  N2 sends the packet to N1 (192.0.2.1).

3.2.7.  Packet Arrives at N1

   When the packet arrives at N1, it does the following:

     (1)  N1 reads 10.1.1.2 from the Enhanced Destination Address.

     (2)  It writes this value in the IPv4 Destination Host Number
          field.

     (3)  It zeroes the EDP bit and the Enhanced Destination Address
          field.

     (4)  N1 recomputes the IP checksum and if the protocol is TCP or
          UDP, recomputes these checksums as well.

     (5)  N1 sends the packet to EIP1.

3.3.  Upgrading Servers to Support EnIP

   In order to maintain backward compatibility with old IPv4 systems, it
   is important that the EnIP Source Address is an allowed private
   address.  Otherwise, that address becomes a routable address outside
   of an autonomous system and there is a potential for routing
   ambiguity.

   With a kernel modification to support EnIP, an existing server
   deployed using an IPv4 address can be upgraded.  The example of a TCP
   echo server [RFC862] is shown in detail elsewhere [Chimiak-2014].
   However, highlights are now presented here.

   An echo server logs the source IP address of each data packet with
   the getpeername function.  However, the length of the IPv4 address

   structure returned is currently 16 bytes for IPv4 (the size of a
   struct sockaddr_in).  For IPv6 the size of struct sockaddr_in6 is 28
   bytes.  As an example of the Alpha implementation mentioned
   previously, EnIP returns a new structure called struct sockaddr_ein
   that is 26 bytes.  It is necessary to use the length 26 to detect a
   struct sockaddr_ein.  This new struct has two values: sin addr1 and
   sin addr2.  These represent the IPv4 source address and the EnIP
   Source Address.  An implementation of getpeername could provide a
   compatibility mode to treat EnIP addresses as IPv4 addresses.  Once
   the echo client software is upgraded, the getpeername implementation
   could return struct sockaddr_ein.

3.4.  DNS Operation

   RFC 2928 provides 2001:0101 as the experimental IPv6 prefix[RFC2928]
   .  EnIP lookups can use already standardized AAAA records with this
   prefix.  This prefix uses 32 bits of the 128 bit AAAA record.  EnIP
   uses only 64 bits of the remaining 96 bits.  If 192.0.2.2.10.1.1.2 is
   the EnIP address, the EnIP AAAA record is
   2001:0101:c000:0202:0a01:0102::0.  We call this an AA record.  A new
   record type is not needed and eliminates the need for DNS server
   software upgrades on a massive scale.

3.5.  Information Security

   The same article shows the care taken to minimize changes in IDS/
   Firewalls Operation.  It also addresses the prevention of EnIP NAT or
   hosts from forwarding illegal packets, and its operation with most of
   IPSEC, except in the full tunnel mode AH+ESP scenario.

4.  Tests and Comparisons of EnIP and Typical IPv4

   The IEEE Computer Magazine article describes the two-node EnIP test
   deployment over the Internet 2 network with the EnIP NATs.  The
   tests, along with their results, are given that compare typical IPv4
   connections with EnIP connections [Chimiak-2014].  EnIP was used
   across 7 routers on Internet 2 to demonstrate viability in
   environments that need more addressing.

   In brief, the test had a node at the University of Maryland running
   the Linux 2.6.38 kernel with patches to include the EnIP alpha code.
   Another similar node was set up at the University of Delaware.  Each
   had an EnIP NAT.  http, samba, and ssh were used without modification
   with Enhanced IP DNS calls used.

   The results, in section 5.3 of the paper[Chimiak-2014], show EnIP
   performance gains over traditional NAT, as there are no hash table
   lookups, as in NAT.  It provided roughly a factor of 2 improvement.

Internet-Draft       IPv4 with 64 bit Address Space         January 2015


   EnIP has also had basic testing with a 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE)
   simulator along with an Android phone.  However, these results have
   not been compiled.

5.  Conclusion

   This RFC describes the operation of IPv4 using IP options, called
   Enhanced IP or EnIP.  EnIP provides a solution to IPv4 address
   scarcity.  Because the EnIP design criteria is to extend IPv4 instead
   of replacing it, it reduces impact on routers and information
   security mechanisms already in place.  The operation of two EnIP
   nodes at the University of Maryland and the University of Delaware,
   running http, samba, and ssh without modification of the software or
   routers in the path demonstrates the feasibility of EnIP on a small
   but realistic scale that spanned seven routers.

   Tests were conducted and documented, that show expected performance
   improvement over the old NAT currently used, and the new EnIP NAT.
   It provided roughly a factor of 2 improvement [Chimiak-2014].
