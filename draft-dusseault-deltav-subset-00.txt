   This document specifies a consistent profile or subset of the 
   features from the DeltaV specification [DeltaV].  The subset is 
   suitable for simple linear document versioning in a WebDAV [RFC2518] 
   environment.  The subset is intended to limit functionality in order 
   to improve predictability and thus interoperability.  If a server 
   advertises support for this subset, then a client can interoperate 
   with that server very easily due to its predictability.  A server 
   advertising support for this subset MUST also support DeltaV.

1  Overview 
    
   DeltaV [DeltaV] is a very complete versioning specification for 
   diverse environments.  It has options to support a wide variety of 
   versioning features ranging from simple to complex.  It is capable 
   of exposing a source code repository to source management clients, 
   which typically have very extensive and complex versioning 
   functionality requirements.  
    
   The DeltaV specification presents a few challenges for simpler 
   authoring software: 
    
     - Server implementers may find it difficult to choose a limited 
        subset of features that is sufficient and complete for simple 
        versioning, yet is compliant with DeltaV. 
     - Clients that are not primarily versioning applications may not 
        wish to implement extensive code for handling all the DeltaV 
        features, and thus will find it challenging to deal with 
        servers that vary in what features and options are implemented. 
     - Clients and servers both may have to expend a lot of research 
        and thought to figure out what features to support to 
        interoperate with a large number of other DeltaV 
        implementations. 
    
   This document attempts to improve interoperability for simple 
   versioning in the following ways: 
    
     - By setting aside some features which need not be implemented at 
        all for clients or servers following this subset (e.g. merge, 
        baseline, activity features) 
     - By recommending limited options for features that are complex 
        (e.g. only one value recommended for auto-versioning behavior) 
     - By explaining and providing examples where helpful. 
     - By explaining how to implement a non-forking server with 
        DeltaV. 
    
   The versioning model followed by this draft is unchanged from the 
   DeltaV model. 
    
2  Introduction 
    
2.1 Definition of Simple Versioning 
    
   Simple versioning systems are those that work with largely 
   independent documents.  This description includes user-oriented 
   documents such as images, word processor documents, spreadsheets, 
   and plain text files.  This description does not include files that 
   are strongly inter-related and that change frequently, such as the 
   set of source code files that need to be compiled together to build 
   a software program. The definition here is merely a matter of 
   convenience in order to be able to draw a line; however, from 
   looking at the versioning systems that exist, they do seem to fall 
   into two categories on either side of that line.

   Systems that implement source code versioning have a number of 
   requirements that are not necessarily requirements when source code 
   isnÆt involved. Some of the differences: 
    
     - Source code file versions relate to each other in very 
        important ways.  Thus, there may be a need for workspaces to 
        group related files together while working on new versions, or 
        baselines to group a bunch of versions together, or activities 
        or version-controlled collections.  In contrast, the dominant 
        situation with regular document collaboration is that each 
        document is stand-alone: although it relates to other 
        documents, it doesnÆt have to be kept in strict compatibility 
        with other documents in the same system.  Although a few 
        documentation tools link natural-language documents together, 
        these tools and the documents they produce are rare compared to 
        stand-alone natural-language documents. 
      
     - Source code systems generally require multiple authors to be 
        able to modify a file at the same time.  Features like multiple 
        working resources and/or activities are usually required.  
        Also, source code systems may often be able to merge changes 
        from multiple authors together because of the nature of files 
        stored in those systems.  In contrast, in simple document 
        management situations, it's usually sufficient to limit 
        authoring to one at a time, and it's rarely easy to merge 
        documents together (imagine merging two sets of changes to one 
        image together).  Thus, both multiple working resources and 
        merges are not required for simple document versioning. 
      
     - Source code repositories are usually required to keep all old 
        versions.  It can be very important to be able to retrieve any 
        archived version.  In contrast, there are sometimes scenarios 
        where itÆs very important to delete old versions, for legal 
        purposes or for privacy.  Note that DeltaV does allow versions 
        to be deleted, but it also allows the server to forbid deleting 
        versions, so clients may not be able to predict server behavior 
        in this respect until trying it. 
      
     - Interoperability with existing WebDAV clients like Office 2000 
        and Adobe authoring applications is of primary importance for 
        document-oriented versioning servers.  Source code versioning 
        servers may not have to interoperate with those, but instead 
        only have to interoperate with more special-purpose versioning 
        clients (CVS client, Visual Source Safe client, subversion). 
      
     - Forking is usually required in source control systems, but 
        rarely required in simple document systems.  Unlike source code 
        files, when regular files need to diverge down two paths, they 
        can almost always be copied and given two different names or 
        locations. 
    
   In summary, a simple document versioning system can implement less 
   than half the features a complete source versioning system needs, 
     
   Dusseault              Expires April 2002                         4 
                  DeltaV Subset for Simple Authoring      October 2001 
    
   yet satisfy 90% of the needs for authors of those documents.  If 
   this profile selects features carefully it can vastly reduce the 
   complexity of versioning for simple document management clients and 
   servers, yet still remain entirely compatible with DeltaV.   
    
2.2 Requirements for Simple Versioning 
    
   The following functionality is required in document versioning 
   systems. 
    
     - Interoperate with non-versioning clients 
     - Turn versioning on for a resource 
     - Turn versioning off for a resource (by deleting the VHR) 
     - Find all versions 
     - Support for checkout-in-place required for interoperability 
        with non-versioning-aware clients. 
     - Support for deleting versions 
     - Global properties -- properties whose value applies to the 
        entire version history, not just one version (these are 
        supported on the VHR) 
    
   As a result of these requirements, the following DeltaV features are 
   required: 
    
     - version-control 
     - checkout-in-place 
     - version-history 
    
   The DeltaV feature "working-resource" is recommended as well, but 
   optional. 
    
   This specification defines an additional feature string "simple-
   deltav-subset", to be displayed in the OPTIONS response.  This helps 
   the client know if the server is going to behave predictably.  If 
   the server advertises "simple-deltav-subset" support, it must meet 
   the following requirements: 
    
     - MUST NOT have forks in the version history 
     - MUST NOT allow UPDATE to make a version other than the latest 
        version be the target version 
     - MUST NOT allow versions to be checked out 
     - MUST NOT have more than one working resource associated with a 
        VCR 
     - MUST NOT have more than one VCR associated with a VHR. 
     - MUST support version-control, checkout-in-place, version-
        history features 
    
   The OPTIONS response for a server supporting this specification may 
   look like this: 
    
     OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1 
     Host: subset.deltav.webdav.org

     HTTP/1.1 200 OK

        working-resource, simple-deltav-subset 
     Allow: PUT, POST, HEAD, OPTIONS, GET, TRACE, DELETE, CONNECT,  
        PROPFIND, PROPPATCH, MKCOL, COPY, MOVE, LOCK, UNLOCK,  
        VERSION-CONTROL, CHECKOUT, UNCHECKOUT, REPORT 
                 
2.3 Minimal Server Option Discovery Required 
    
   This specification attempts to keep variation between server 
   implementations to an absolute minimum in order to allow very simple 
   client implementations to be written.  There are very few options 
   for variation between servers that support this specification.  This 
   means that the client may have to look in only a couple cases to see 
   which way the server operates.   
    
     - Checkout location: server can support in-place only, or both 
        in-place and working resource. Support for both is there if the 
        server supports this subset plus ôworking-resourceö in the DAV: 
        header. 
     - Auto-versioning: server can support checkin-when-unlocked or 
        nothing.  Client can check this on any VCR by looking at the 
        value of the auto-versioning property. 
   Of course, the server can also support advanced DeltaV features, 
   such as LABEL.  However, if support for advanced features means 
   violating any of the requirements in the previous section, then the 
   server cannot advertise support for "simple-deltav-subset" because 
   it will not be able to meet the expectations of a simple subset 
   client.  
    
2.4 Unsupported DeltaV Features 
    
   In addition to the unsupported packages (label, update, merge, 
   workspace, version-history, baseline, activity, version-controlled-
   collection), these following features are explicitly not supported 
   for this subset.  An implementation is allowed to support them, but 
   interoperability does not require them. 
    
   a)  UPDATE and current version 
   In source control systems, UPDATE is used to get a Version-
   Controlled Resource to point to (represent) a version other than 
   latest checked-in version.  Document systems rarely need this 
   functionality, and worse, it severely complicates many client 
   operations as well as server implementations.  Therefore the UPDATE 
   method and functionality must not be supported on a server 
   advertising support for this subset.  This has the following 
   simplifying consequences: 
    
     - If the resource is checked in, the latest checked-in version is 
        always the one visible in the Version-Controlled Resource. 
     
   Dusseault              Expires April 2002                         6 
                  DeltaV Subset for Simple Authoring      October 2001 
    
     - Whenever the checkout is done it must be done on the VCR.  If 
        the intent is to create a working resource, it must be done 
        with the ôapply-to-versionö flag.   
     - Auto-update will be done whenever a working resource or 
        checkout in-place is checked in.  This means that the ôauto-
        updateö property on a working resource will always contain an 
        href pointing to the VCR.  Servers may refuse any CHECKIN where 
        the auto-update value has not been set as above. 
     - Only the latest version may be checked out.  This makes it much 
        easier to handle checkout-set: only the latest version can ever 
        have a non-null value for checkout-set.  That means the client 
        only needs to check the latest version to see if itÆs checked 
        out, rather than check every version. 
    
   b)  No Fork Support 
   This profile does not include any forking support.  This has the 
   following simplifying consequences: 
    
     - DAV:checkout-fork is ALWAYS forbidden 
     - DAV:checkin-fork is ALWAYS forbidden 
     - Only one checkout of any kind may be made.  Only one working-
        resource can exist, and only if the resource isnÆt checked-out 
        in-place.  A resource may be checked out in-place only if no 
        working-resource exists. 
     - In order to find out if a resource is checked out, the client 
        can simply look on the VCR for the DAV:checked-out property to 
        see if there is an in-place checkout, and look at the latest 
        version to see if there is a working resource checkout.  In 
        other words, a resource is checked out if either the checked-
        out property is set on the VCR or the checkout-set property is 
        set on the HREF identified in the checked-in property of the 
        VCR. 
    
3  Required Resources 
    
   In addition to regular WebDAV resources and collections, support for 
   this DeltaV subset requires three additional types of resources: 
   versions (a specific version of a resource), VCRs and Version 
   History Resources (VHR).   
    
   A server may also support working resources, which are a separate 
   resource type. 
    
   Since these are all separate resources, only one should be locked at 
   a time; that is, for any given client LOCK request, the server 
   should only lock the resource addressed with the URL, and not lock 
   associated resources.  That means the client can lock their VCR (to 
   indicate to non-versioning clients that it is being edited) but not 
   lock their Working Resource at the same time (in order to be able to 
   send the Working Resource URL to another user and collaborate on the 
   next version).

3.1 Version-Controlled Resources 
    
   Requirements: 
    
     - VCRs MUST be lockable.   
     - VCRs MUST support write operations because they must be 
        compatible with non-versioning clients (including PROPPATCH, 
        PUT). 
     - VCRs SHOULD be deletable. 
    
3.2 Versions 
    
   Requirements: 
    
     - Versions should not be lockable. 
     - Versions MUST NOT support any write operation. 
     - Versions SHOULD be deletable. 
    
3.3 Working Resources 
    
   Requirements: 
    
     - WRs MUST be lockable, separately from VCRs, because they can be 
        modified independently. 
     - WRs MUST support write operations. 
    
   Clients should not attempt to DELETE a working resource, in order to 
   make it simpler for server implementations.  Instead, a working 
   resource can be removed by issuing an UNCHECKOUT. 
    
3.4 Version History Resources 
    
   Requirements: 
    
     - VHRs SHOULD be lockable because they can be modified 
        independently. 
     - VHRs SHOULD support write operations. 
     - VHRs SHOULD support PROPPATCH of custom properties.   
    
    
4  Recommended Functionality 
    
4.1 Deleting VCRs 
    
   It should be possible to delete VCRs, because many document 
   management systems require the ability to cleanup in order to free 
   quota, remove obsolete documents, etc.  Deleting a VCR should result 
   in the cleanup of all resources associated with the VCR: the VHR, 
   the working resources, and the versions.  Of course if any of these 
   is locked or the client is not authorized to delete them, the 
   request can fail.   
    
4.2 Turning Versioning Off 
    
     
   Dusseault              Expires April 2002                         8 
                  DeltaV Subset for Simple Authoring      October 2001 
    
   The DeltaV specification is silent on how to turn versioning off for 
   a Version-Controlled Resource (VCR).  Although this is almost never 
   done in source-control systems, it may easily be required in simple 
   document management systems.  Some evidence for this point of view 
   is that existing document management systems have already 
   implemented this feature. 
    
   Thus, although the feature of turning versioning off should be 
   optional, it would improve interoperability to define the mechanism 
   by which it is done. 
    
   One previously suggested mechanism is to COPY the VCR to a new 
   location (which may create a new, unversioned resource) then DELETE 
   the VCR.  Finally, the new location is renamed to the original name 
   with MOVE.  This mechanism is inappropriate because it loses 
   information on the original file: creation date, the name of the 
   original creator, access logs, etc. 
    
   This specification recommends rather to delete the VHR in order to 
   turn the VCR into a non-versioned resource.  This requires the 
   server to allow deletion of VHRs in order to support this feature.  
   It also requires the server to do cleanup: the VCR must be turned 
   into an ordinary resource, with the properties that would be 
   expected of an ordinary resource. For example, the "version-
   history", "checked-in", "auto-version", and "checked-out" properties 
   must be removed from the VCR if present.  Working resources 
   associated with the VCR should be deleted.   
    
   There are certainly circumstances where deleting the VHR should be 
   forbidden: 
    
     - The client is not authorized to perform this action 
     - The VHR, VCR, or a working resource associated with the VCR is 
        locked, and a lock-token was not provided or the client is not 
        authorized to use the lock-token. 
     - The server does not support this functionality 
    
4.3 Deleting Versions 
    
   Although DeltaV does not require servers to either allow or disallow 
   the ability to delete versions, this specification recommends 
   allowing versions to be deleted by clients with sufficient 
   authorized permissions.  When a version is deleted, the server must 
   clean up so that the state of the resources is consistent.  That 
   means that the version must be deleted from any "predecessor-set" 
   and "successor-set" property in which it appears, and replaced by a 
   version which still exists. If the version is the first/root or the 
   last/latest version, the cleanup may need to be a little different 
   (the root-version property on the VHR must change), but it should 
   still be possible to delete the version.  The first/root version is 
   replaced by the version that was created after it, the last/latest 
   version is replaced by the version that was created before it.

   The last remaining version, which is both the root and the latest 
   existing version, cannot be deleted.  If the client finds itself in 
   this situation and wishes to delete the last remaining version, it 
   has two choices: 
    
     - Delete the entire VCR. 
     - Add a "dummy" version.  Now the other version can be deleted 
        and the dummy version becomes the last remaining version, also 
        the root and latest existing version.  This should not be 
        necessary as long as the server supports deleting the entire 
        VCR. 
    
5  Required Methods 
    
   For these methods, error handling is done exactly as specified by 
   DeltaV.  
    
5.1 VERSION-CONTROL  
    
   The version-control method is required to turn versioning on, 
   because in simple versioning systems typically not all documents are 
   required to be versioned. In this subset, the VERSION-CONTROL method 
   never needs a body.   
    
     VERSION-CONTROL foo.doc HTTP/1.1 
     Host: server.com 
      
   Full DeltaV clients may send XML bodies on VERSION-CONTROL requests 
   (this is part of the Workspace feature).  When a server receives a 
   VERSION-CONTROL request that has a well-formed XML body, it should 
   not reject the request (either with 400 Bad Request or 415 
   Unsupported Media Type).  Another inappropriate response would be to 
   simply ignore the body and successfully process the request -- 
   because that would result in the client asking for one action and 
   the server performing another.   
    
   What the server must do is examine the XML body and find out if it's 
   simply an empty "version-control" element or not.  If it's an empty 
   "version-control" element or contains XML elements not defined in 
   DeltaV, then the server can successfully process the request (recall 
   that RFC2518 specifies that unknown XML elements may be ignored).  
   On the other hand, if the "version-control" element contains 
   "version" elements, then the server should fail the request, and the 
   most appropriate failure code is 501 Not Implemented.  Note that a 
   client should never send this request body to a server that does not 
   support workspaces. 
    
5.2 CHECKOUT 
    
   In this subset, the checkout method can only be used to check out 
   the tip node, or latest version. This is because forking and 
   multiple checkouts are not part of simple versioning.  (Note that it 
   is possible to copy the contents of an older version to a working 
     
   Dusseault              Expires April 2002                        10 
                  DeltaV Subset for Simple Authoring      October 2001 
    
   resource or in-place checkout, so itÆs still possible to work from 
   the content of an older version). 
    
   To do checkout in-place, no body is required: 
    
     CHECKOUT foo.doc HTTP/1.1 
     Host: server.com:8080 
      
   To do checkout to a working resource, make the checkout request to a 
   version URL instead of to the VCR URL.  In this case, the ôapply-to-
   versionö flag is required, so a body is required for the CHECKOUT 
   method.  The ôfork-okö flag should not be present: 
    
     CHECKOUT foo.doc.v1 HTTP/1.1 
     Host: server.com:8080 
     Content-type: text/xml 
     Content-Length: xxx 
      
     <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\" ?> 
     <D:checkout xmlns:D='DAV:'> 
     <D:apply-to-version/> 
     </D:checkout> 
 
5.3 CHECKIN 
    
   In this subset, CHECKIN can be applied either to a VCR that is 
   checked out in-place, or to a working resource.  The check-in always 
   fully checks in and updates the resource; that is, the resource does 
   not remain checked out, and the version-controlled resource acquires 
   the properties and content of the version just created. 
    
   Because checkin only has one behavior, no body is required. 
    
     CHECKIN foo.doc HTTP/1.1 
     Host: server.com:8080 
      
5.4 UNCHECKOUT 
    
   UNCHECKOUT works as defined in DeltaV.  Note that UNCHECKOUT only 
   works on checkout-in-place.  In order to æuncheckoutÆ a working 
   resource in a DeltaV compatible manner, the client should delete the 
   working resource. 
    
   If the client deletes a working resource, the server must restore 
   the VCR and its versions to a consistent state so that some other 
   user can check out the resource.  That means at a minimum the 
   ôchecked-outö property of the version that was checked out needs to 
   be removed now.   
    
5.5 REPORT

                  DeltaV Subset for Simple Authoring      October 2001 
    
   The report method is supported because of the requirement to get a 
   list of versions associated with a resource û the version-tree 
   report provides this functionality. 
    
   A good example of the REPORT method may be found in section 3.7 of 
   the DeltaV specification. 
6  Required Properties 
    
6.1 DAV:comment 
    
   Required: on all resources 
   Writable: can be written except on checked-in versions

6.3 DAV:supported-report-set 
    
   Required on: All resources 
   Writable: protected 
    
   Since this subset only uses the version-tree report, servers only 
   have to list that one report and only for VCRs and versions (but are 
   free to support others). The recommended value for supported-report 
   set depends on the resource type: 
    
   Version-Controlled Resource or Version: 
    
     <D:supported-report-set> 
       <D:version-tree> 
     </D:supported-report-set> 
      
   All other resources: 
    
     <D:supported-report-set> 
     </D:supported-report-set> 
      
6.4 DAV:supported-live-property-set 
    
   Required on: all resources

   Example: this example is for a regular, non-versioned resource, on a 
   server supporting locking.

6.5 DAV:creator-displayname 
    
   Required on: all resources 
   Writable: Fully writable except on checked-in versions. 
    
   The DAV:creator-displayname property is required on all WebDAV 
   resources, including regular resources, collections, VCRs and 
   versions.  It does not need to have a value. 
    
     <D:creator-displayname>[!CDATA[John Doe]]</D:creator-displayname> 
      
6.6 DAV:checked-in 
    
   Required on: every checked-in VCR 
   Writable: Protected. 
    
   The DAV:checked in property is required on VCRs that are checked in.  
   In this subset, the version URL value of the property is always the 
   latest checked-in version. 
    
     <D:checked-in>http://server.com/url-to-version</D:checked-in> 
      
6.7 DAV:checked-out 
    
   Required on: every checked-out VCR

   The DAV:checked-out property is required on VCRs that are checked 
   out.  In this subset, the version URL value is always the latest 
   checked-in version. 
    
     <D:checked-in>http://server.com/url-to-version</D:checked-in> 
      
6.8 DAV:auto-version 
    
   Required on: every VCR  
   Writable: Protected. 
    
   Although this property is required on every VCR, certain values are 
   discouraged.  One value is recommended.  In this subset, the 
   property MUST be protected, and should be the same for every 
   resource in the repository.

     - No value: this is allowed.  It indicates the server does not 
        support auto-versioning at all.   Non-versioning-aware clients 
        then cannot modify version-controlled resources. 
     - DAV:checkout-unlocked-checkin is encouraged because it has the 
        best interaction with clients that lock and do auto-save:  it 
        produces only one new version for each editing session.  The 
        checkout is performed not when the LOCK request is received, 
        but when the first PUT (or other write operation) is received.  
        The checkin is performed when the UNLOCK is received.  When 
        clients that do not lock modify documents, the document is 
        checked out and checked in again along with the write 
        operation. 
     - DAV:checkout-checkin is discouraged because the with clients 
        that auto-save and are versioning-unaware, even if they lock 
        the file during a session of editing, this behavior would 
        produce too many versions. 
     - DAV:checkout and DAV:locked-checkout are discouraged because 
        they donÆt work with clients that are versioning-unaware.  The 
        user would have to go out of band to do the checkin û and they 
        wonÆt know to.  If forking is disallowed, this would prevent 
        all other users from checking out. 
    
6.9 DAV:predecessor-set 
    
   Required on: every checked-out VCR and every version.  
   Writable: Protected 
    
   In this subset, DAV:predecessor-set contains only the URL of the 
   version preceding this one.  This is a direct consequence of taking 
   the DeltaV definition for this property, then not supporting forking 
   or update.

   In this subset, DAV:checkout-set is either empty (there are no 
   checkouts related to this version or this version-history) or has a 
   single value.  If the check-out is in-place, the URL in this 
   property is the URL of the VCR.  If the check-out is to a working
