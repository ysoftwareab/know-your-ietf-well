1. The Internet-Standard Management Framework 
    
   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current 
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of 
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410]. 
    
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed 
   the Management Information Base or MIB. MIB objects are generally 
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). 
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the 
   Structure of Management Information (SMI). This memo specifies a MIB  
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58, 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 
   [RFC2580].

2. Terminology 
    
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and 
   "OPTIONAL", when used in the guidelines in this memo, are to be 
   interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
   The terms "MIB module" and "information module" are used 
   interchangeably in this memo.  As used here, both terms refer to any 
   of the three types of information modules defined in Section 3 of 
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578]. 
    
   The terms in this document are derived from the documents associated 
   with the PacketCable Provisioning Specification [PKT-SP-PROV-IO6-
   030415] and Security Specification [PKT-SP-SEC-I08-030415]. 
    
2.1 DOCSIS 
    
   "Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification".  A term referring 
   to the ITU-T J.112 Annex B standard for cable modem systems  
   [ITU-T-J112]. 
    
2.2 Cable Modem 
    
   A Cable Modem (CM) acts as a data transport agent used to transfer 
   call management and voice data packets over the DOCSIS compliant 
   cable systems. 
    
2.3 Multimedia Terminal Adapter 
    
   Multimedia Terminal Adapter (MTA) is used to refer to any 
   PacketCable/IPCablecom compliant device providing telephony services 
   over the cable or hybrid system used to deliver video signals to a 
   community. MTA can be Embedded (E-MTA) or Standalone (S-MTA). E-MTA 
   contains both an MTA and a CM. S-MTA does not contain the CM part 
   relying on the presence of some external DOCSIS agent to provide the 
   data transport over the cable. MTA Contains the interface(s) to a 
   physical voice device, a network interface, CODECs, and all 
   signaling and encapsulation functions required for VoIP transport, 
   class feature signaling and QoS signaling. 
    
2.4 Endpoint 
    
   A standard RJ-11 telephony physical port located on the MTA and used 
   for attaching the telephone device to the MTA.

3. Overview 
    
   This MIB provides a set of objects required for the management of 
   PacketCable/IPCablecom compliant MTA Devices. The MTA Module MIB is 
   derived in part from the parameters described in PacketCable 1.0 MTA 
   MIB Specification [PKT-SP-MIB-MTA-IO6-030415]. 
    
3.1 Structure of the MIB 
 
   This MIB is identified by pktcMtaMib and is structured in three 
   groups: 
    
   - Management information pertinent to MTA Device Itself 
   (pktcMtaDevBase) 
    
   - Management information pertinent to the Provisioning back office 
   Servers (pktcMtaDevServer) 
    
   - Management information pertinent to elements of and logic 
   providing the PacketCable Security mechanisms (pktcMtaDevSecurity) 
    
   First two groups contain only scalar information describing the 
   corresponding characteristics of the MTA device and back office 
   servers.  
    
   Third group contains two tables controlling the necessary logical 
   associations between KDC realms and back office servers (CMS and 
   provisioning). 
    
   Rows in the tables can be created automatically (e.g. by the device 
   according to the current state information) or can be created by the 
   management station depending on the operational situation. Tables 
   may and generally will have a mixture of both types of rows. 
    
3.2 pktcMtaDevBase 
    
   Contains management information describing the parameters of the MTA 
   device itself. Also, this group contains some objects controlling 
   the MTA state. Some of the MIB objects are as follows:

PacketCable/IPCablecom MTA MIB                                May 2003 
 
 
    
   - pktcMtaDevSerialNumber - Contains the MTA Serial Number, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevEndPntCount -  Contains the number of End Points present 
   in MTA, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevProvisioningState - This object contains the information 
   describing the completion state of the initialization process, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevEnabled - Controls the state of the MTA enabling or 
   disabling telephony services on the device, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevResetNow - This object is used to instruct the MTA to 
   reset itself. 
    
3.3 pktcMtaDevServer 
    
   Contains management information describing the back office servers 
   and the parameters assigned to the communication timeouts. Also, 
   this group contains some objects controlling the initial MTA 
   interaction with the Provisioning Server. 
    
   Some of the MIB objects are as follows: 
    
   - pktcMtaDevServerDhcp1 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Primary DHCP server designated for MTA provisioning, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevServerDhcp2 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Secondary DHCP server designated for MTA provisioning, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevServerDns1 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Primary DNS used by MTA to resolve the FQDN and IP Addresses, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevServerDns2 - This object contains the IP Address of the 
   Secondary DNS used by MTA to resolve the FQDN and IP Addresses, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevConfigFile - This object contains the name of the 
   provisioning configuration file to download from the Provisioning 
   Server by the MTA, 
    
   - pktcMtaDevProvConfigHash - This object is used to supply the hash 
   value of MTA Configuration File calculated over its content. 
    
3.4 pktcMtaDevSecurity 
    
   Contains management information describing the security related 
   characteristics of the MTA.

PacketCable/IPCablecom MTA MIB                                May 2003 
 
 
   Also, this group contains two tables containing logical dependencies 
   and parameters necessary to establish security association between 
   the MTA and other components of the back office. 
    
   - pktcMtaDevRealmTable - This table is used in conjunction with any 
   server which needs a Security Association with an MTA (CMS or 
   Provisioning Sever), 
   - pktcMtaDevCmsTable - This table contains the parameters describing 
   the SA establishment between an MTA and a CMS. 
 
3.5 Relationship between MIB Objects in MTA MIB 
    
   This section clarifies the relationship between various MIB Objects 
   in MTA MIB in respect to the role these objects are playing in the 
   process of the Security Association establishment. 
   Relationships between the MTA MIB Objects are defined by process of 
   the establishment of the Security Association which is described in 
   the PacketCable Security Specification [PKT-SP-SEC-I08-030415]. 
 
   The SA establishment process between the MTA and other back office 
   Application Servers (CMS or Provisioning Server) consists of two 
   steps: 
   - AS-exchange providing mutual authentication of the parties (MTA 
   and the Application Server), 
   - AP-exchange providing the Key Distribution between the parties 
   (MTA and the Application Server). 
   Each Server-MTA Security Association has a one-to-one correspondence 
   to a single Realm. 
   The process of AS-exchange is defined by the number of parameters 
   grouped per each Realm. These parameters are collected in the Realm 
   Table. Realm Table is indexed by the Index Counter and contains 
   conceptual column with the Kerberos Realm Name. 
   CMS Table contains the parameters defining the process of the AP-
   exchange between the MTA and the CMS when MTA is exchanging the keys 
   for SA with CMS. CMS Table is indexed by the Index Counter and 
   contains conceptual column with CMS FQDN. Each row of the Table also 
   contains the Realm Name corresponding to each CMS FQDN in the row. 
   This allows for multiple realms, each with its own Security 
   Association. 
   MTA MIB also contains the group of the scalar MIB Objects which 
   define the Parameters for AP-exchange process between the MTA and 
   the Provisioning Server. These objects are: 
    
   - pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxTimeout, 
   - pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyNomTimeout, 
   - pktcMtaDevProvUnsolicitedKeyMaxRetries, 
   - pktcMtaDevProvSolicitedKeyTimeout.

   --   Procedures for setting up security associations:

   --   A security association may be setup either via configuration or  
   --   via NCS signaling.  
   --  
   --   I.   Security association setup via configuration.  
   --  
   --   The realm must be configured first.  Associated with the realm   
   --   is a KDC.  The realm table (pktcMtaDevRealmTable) indicates   
   --   information about realm (e.g., name, organization name) and

   --   parameters associated with KDC communications (e.g., grace   
   --   periods,  AS request/AS reply adaptive backoff parameters).  
   --  
   --   Once the realm is established, one or more servers may be   
   --   defined in the realm.  For PacketCable 1.0, these are Call   
   --   Management Servers (CMSs). Associated with each CMS   
   --   entry in the pktcMtaDevCmsTable is an explicit reference   
   --   to a Realm via the realm ( pktcMtaDevCmsKerbRealmName),   
   --   the FQDN of the CMS, and parameters associated with IPSec  
   --   key management with the CMS (e.g., clock skew, AP request/  
   --   AP reply adaptive backoff parameters).  
   --  
   --   II.  Security association setup via NCS signaling.  
   --  
   --   The procedure  of establishing of the Security Association 
   --   for NCS Signaling is described in the PacketCable Security 
   --   Specification.  
   --   It involves the analysis of the EndPointNcsTable row 
   --        for the corresponding end-point number and correlating 
   --        the CMS FQDN from this row with the CMS Table and  
   --        consequently - with the Realm Table. Both of these tables 
   --        are defined below. 
   --  
   --   III. When the MTA receives wake-up or re-key messages from a  
   --   CMS,  it performs key management based on the corresponding  
   --   entry  in the CMS table.  If the matching CMS entry does not  
   --   exist,  it must ignore the wake-up or re-key messages.  
   --

   --  
   --   pktcMtaDevRealmTable  
   --  
   --   The pktcMtaDevRealmTable shows the KDC realms. The table is  
   --   indexed with pktcMtaDevRealmIndex. The Realm Table contains the  
   --   pktcMtaDevRealmName in conjunction with any server which needs  
   --   a security association with an MTA. Upper case must be use to  
   --   compare the pktcMtaDevRealmName content. 
   --   The server table (today the CMS) has a security association.   
   --   Each server-MTA security association is associated with a  
   --   single Realm. This allows for multiple realms, each with its  
   --   own security association.

8. Security Considerations 
    
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module 
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such 
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network 
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure 
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on 
   network operations.  Improper manipulation of the objects defined in 
   this MIB may result in random behavior of MTA devices and may result 
   in service disruption. These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   - The following objects, if SET maliciously would cause the MTA 
   device to reset and/or stop its service: 
       pktcMtaDevResetNow, 
       pktcMtaDevEnabled. 
   - All writable objects in the pktcMtaDevServer and 
   pktcMtaDevRealmTable groups share the potential, if SET maliciously, 
   to prevent an MTA from provisioning properly, hence there are 
   considered very sensitive for service delivery, in particular: 
       pktcMtaDevProvisioningTimer, 
       pktcMtaDevServerAddressType,   
       pktcMtaDevServerDns1, 
       pktcMtaDevServerDns2 - these two objects, if SET maliciously, 
   will prevent the MTA from being authenticated and consequently from 
   getting the telephony services. 
       pktcMtaDevSnmpEntity,  
       pktcMtaDevProvConfigHash, 
       pktcMtaDevProvConfigKey, 
       pktcMtaDevProvSolicitedKeyTimeout, 
       pktcMtaDevRealmName, 
       pktcMtaDevRealmOrgName,   
       pktcMtaDevRealmStatus - this object, if SET maliciously, would 
   cause the whole row of the table to be deleted which will deny the 
   prevent the MTA from getting the telephony services. 
    
   - All writable objects in the pktcMtaDevCmsTable table share the 
   potentional, if SET maliciously, to disrupt the telephony service by 
   altering which Call Management Server the MTA must send signaling 
   registration to, in particular: 
       pktcMtaDevCmsFqdn, 
       pktcMtaDevCmsKerbRealmName,   
       pktcMtaDevCmsMaxClockSkew,    
       pktcMtaDevCmsSolicitedKeyTimeout, 
       pktcMtaDevCmsUnsolicitedKeyMaxTimeout, 
       pktcMtaDevCmsUnsolicitedKeyNomTimeout, 
       pktcMtaDevRealmUnsolicitedKeyMaxRetries - this object, if set to 
   a zero value '0', may prevent an MTA from retry its attempt to 
   establish a security association with the CMS, 
       pktcMtaDevCmsStatus.     
    
   - The following objects, if SET maliciously will not have an 
   immediate effect on service but they may impact the service 
   performace and may cause avalanche attacks on provisioning servers 
   including Kerberos KDC servers on massive device reboots: 
       pktcMtaDevResetKrbTickets - if set to true, will cause an MTA to 
   request a new Kerberos ticket at reboot. 
       pktcMtaDevRealmPkinitGracePeriod - if set to short periods, will 
   cause MTA to renew its tickets more frequently, 
       pktcMtaDevRealmTgsGracePeriod (same as above),

       pktcMtaDevRealmUnsolicitedKeyMaxTimeout,   
       pktcMtaDevRealmUnsolicitedKeyNomTimeout. 
    
   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module may be considered 
   sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments. Some of these 
   objects may contain information that may be sensitive from a 
   business or customer perspective. It is thus important to control 
   even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly to even 
   encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over the 
   network via SNMP. These are the tables and objects and their 
   sensitivity/vulnerability: 
    
   - pktcMtaDevFQDN - "man-in-the-middle" type of security thread can 
   be posed by allowing an authorized access to the object, 
   - pktcMtaDevEndPntCount - object value may be used by attackers to 
   guess the endpoint names and maliciously ring any or all phones 
   attached to an MTA, 
   - pktcMtaDevHttpAccess - object value may be used by attackers to 
   block HTTP traffic, hence prevent configuration file download, 
   - pktcMtaDevServerDhcp1, 
   - pktcMtaDevServerDhcp2 - Values of these objects may be used by 
   attackers to launch Denial-of-Service attacks on the Telephony 
   Service Provider DHCP servers,  
   - pktcMtaDevProvKerbRealmName, 
   - pktcMtaDevManufacturerCertificate, 
   - pktcMtaDevCertificate, 
   - pktcMtaDevTelephonyRootCertificate - Values of these objects may 
   be used by attackers to launch Denial-of-Service attacks against 
   Kerberos servers. 
    
   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.  
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec), 
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is 
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the 
   objects in this MIB module. 
    
   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features 
   as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8), 
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for 
   authentication and privacy). 
    
   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT 
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to 
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator 
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an 
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to 
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate 
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.
