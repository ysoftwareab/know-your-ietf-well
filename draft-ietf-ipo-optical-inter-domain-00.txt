1  Introduction 
    
   Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) has received much attention 
   recently for use as a control plane for non-packet switched 
   technologies.  In particular, optical technologies have a need to 
   upgrade their control plane as reviewed in reference [2]. Many 
   different optical switching and multiplexing technologies exist and 
   more are sure to come.  For the purposes of this draft we only 
   consider non-packet (i.e. circuit switching) forms of optical 
   switching.

   As the requirements for and extensions to interior gateway protocols 
   such as OSPF and IS-IS have begun to be investigated in the single 
   area case, e.g., reference [3], we consider the requirements that 
   optical networking and switching impose in the inter-domain case.  
   By inter-domain in this draft we consider inter-area, inter-layer, 
   and inter-vendor partitioning of routing and possibly other 
   possibilities for partitioning routing in addition to administrative 
   inter-domain (inter-carrier) partitioning. Comparisons of these 
   requirements to existing functionality in BGP, OSPF, IS-IS and ATM's 
   PNNI routing protocol are made. 
   In particular, optical routing needs to provide for path diversity, 
   switching capabilities, transport capabilities and impairments, and 
   bandwidth/resource status reporting.  
   To add to the concreteness of these considerations we try to 
   illustrate them with one or more specific examples from a particular 
   optical networking layer or technology. This is not to reduce the 
   generality of the requirement but to facilitate the understanding of 
   the requirement or concept.

2  Background  
    
2.1 Basic Concept of Domains and Network Partitioning 
 
   In this draft we use the term domain in a very general sense, i.e., 
   beyond the BGP interpretation of Administrative Domain.  In this 
   draft we will consider domains as the result of partitioning of a 
   network into subnetworks, as shown in the network of Figure 1. A 
   network may be partitioned for a variety of reasons, such as: 
   *    Administrative boundaries 
   *    Scalability of routing or signaling 
   *    Isolation of partitions for security or reliability reasons

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   *    Technology differences in the systems in different domains 
 
   The Inter-Domain interface is likely to have different 
   characteristics than the Intra-Domain interface as the domain 
   boundary exists for the purpose of hiding some aspect within the 
   domain from the outside world. 
   Examples of the use of Domains include BGP Autonomous Systems (AS) 
   and OSPF Areas.  An Administrative Domain AS is a subnetwork under 
   the control of single administration as viewed from outside of the 
   domain. In BGP case this is used to denote an interface between two 
   separate carriers or ISP. In the terminology used here we would call 
   this an inter-carrier domain interface.  An OSPF Area, on the other 
   hand, is a subnetwork within an administrative domain (OSPF 
   specific) and results from partitioning of domains within a single 
   carrier, i.e., the interface to an Area is an intra-carrier domain 
   interface.

   The domain concept as used here is orthogonal to the transport 
   network concept of layering.  When the term layer is used with 
   respect to the transport network we are not referring to the 7- 
   layer OSI model which includes application, presentation, etc., 
   layers.  With regard to this model all the optical transport layers 
   would lie at the "physical layer".  In the transport network, layers 
   are used for multiplexing, performance monitoring and fault 
   management purposes. Layers tend to be very technology specific.  At 
   some point an optical routing protocol must include information 
   particular to the technology layer for which it is being used to 
   acquire/disseminate topology and resource status information.  For 
   more information on layering and domain concepts see reference 
   [G.805].  
    
2.2 Major Differences between Optical and IP datagram Routing 
    
   Let us first review the major difference between routing for optical 
   (circuit switched networks) and IP datagram networks.  In IP 
   datagram networks packet forwarding is done on a hop-by-hop basis 
   (no connection established ahead of time).  While circuit switched 
   optical networks end to end connections must be explicitly 
   established based on network topology and resource status 
   information.  This topology and resource status information can be 
   obtained via routing protocols. Note that the routing protocols in 
   the circuit switch case are not involved with data (or bit) 
   forwarding, i.e., they are not "service impacting", while in the IP 
   datagram case the routing protocols are explicitly involved with 
   data plane forwarding decisions and hence are very much service 
   impacting.  
    
   This does not imply routing is unimportant in the optical case, only 
   that its service impacting effect is secondary.  For example, 
   topology and resource status inaccuracies will affect whether a new 
   connection can be established (or a restoration connection can be 
   established) but will not (and should not) cause an existing 
   connection to be torn down. 
    
   This tends to lead to a slightly different view towards 
   incorporating new information fields (objects, LSA, etc.) into 
   optical routing protocols versus IP routing protocols.  In the 
   optical circuit case, any information that can potentially aid in 
   route computations or be used in service differentiation may be 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 6] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   incorporated into the route protocol, as either a standard element 
   or a vendor specific extension.  Whether a route computation 
   algorithm uses this information and whether two route computation 
   algorithms use this information in the same way doesn’t matter since 
   the optical connections are explicitly routed (although perhaps 
   loosely). The optical route computation problem is really a 
   constraint-based routing problem. The basic route calculation is an 
   atomic service that occurs, for a given connection, in a single 
   network element. (In the case of loose explicit routing some details 
   may be filled in by other NE’s.) This means that, even in a 
   heterogeneous optical network, NEs from different vendors need not 
   use the same algorithm.  
    
   Another difference - clear, hard blocking prevails in the optical 
   world while some level of overloading is ok in the IP world, i.e., 
   statistical multiplexing is not available with optical circuits.  
   This also manifests itself in the commitment of the protection (or 
   restoration) bandwidth. In a packet-based network although the 
   protection path can be setup prior to any fault, the resources along 
   the protection path are not used until the failure occurs.  In 
   circuit-based networks a protection path generally implies a 
   committed resource. Such a basic difference restricts the direct 
   applicability of some of the traffic engineering mechanisms used in 
   a packet-based network to a circuit-based network. 
 
    
2.3 Diversity in Optical Routing  
 
   There are two basic demands that drive the need to discover diverse 
   routes for establishing optical paths: 
        1. Reliability/Robustness 
        2. Bandwidth capacity. 
    
   Many times multiple optical connections are set up between the same 
   end points. An important constraint on these connections is that 
   they must be diversely routed in some way [4].  In particular they 
   could be routed over paths that are link diverse, i.e., two 
   connections do not share any common link. Or the more stringent 
   constraint that the two paths should be node diverse, i.e., the two 
   paths do not traverse any common node.  
     
   Additionally, insufficient bandwidth may exist to set up all the 
   desired connection across the same path (set of links) and hence we 
   need to know about alternative (diverse) ways of reaching the 
   destination that may still have unused capacity. 
 
   "Diversity" is a relationship between lightpaths. Two lightpaths are 
   said to be diverse if they have no single point of failure. In 
   traditional telephony the dominant transport failure mode is a 
   failure in the interoffice plant, such as a fiber cut inflicted by a 
   backhoe.  
    
  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 7] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   Data network operators have relied on their private line providers 
   to ensure diversity and so IP routing protocols have not had to deal 
   directly with the problem. GMPLS makes the complexities handled by 
   the private line provisioning process, including diversity, part of 
   the common control plane and so visible to all.  
    
   Diversity is discussed in the IPO WG document [5]. A key associated 
   concept, "Shared Risk Link Groups", is discussed in a number of 
   other IETF (refs) and OIF (refs) documents.  Some implications for 
   routing that are drawn in [5] are: 
     . Dealing with diversity is an unavoidable requirement for 
        routing in the optical layer.  It requires dealing with 
        constraints in the routing process but most importantly 
        requires additional state information – the SRLG relationships 
        and also the routings of any existing circuits from which the 
        new circuit is to be diverse – to be available to the routing 
        process. 
    
     . At present SRLG information cannot be self-discovered. Indeed, 
        in a large network it is very difficult to maintain accurate 
        SRLG information. The problem becomes particularly daunting 
        whenever multiple administrative domains are involved, for 
        instance after the acquisition of one network by another, 
        because there normally is a likelihood that there are diversity 
        violations between the domains. It is very unlikely that 
        diversity relationships between carriers will be known any time 
        in the near future. 
 
    - Considerable variation in what different customers will mean by 
   acceptable diversity should be anticipated. Consequently we suggest 
   that an SRLG should be defined as follows: (i) It is a relationship 
   between two or more links, and (ii) it is characterized by two 
   parameters, the type of compromise (shared conduit, shared ROW, 
   shared optical ring, etc.) and the extent of the compromise (e.g., 
   the number of miles over which the compromise persisted). This will 
   allow the SRLG’s appropriate to a particular routing request to be 
   easily identified. 
    
2.3.1   Generalizing Link Diversity 
 
   Optical networks may posses a number of hierarchical signaling 
   layers.  For example two routers interconnected across an optical 
   network may communicate with IP packets encapsulated within an STS-
   48c SONET path layer signal.  Within the optical network this STS-
   48c signal may be multiplexed at the SONET line layer into an OC-192 
   line layer signal.  In addition this OC-192 may be wavelength 
   division multiplexed onto a fiber with other OC-192 signals at 
   different wavelengths (lambdas).  These WDM signals can then be 
   either lambda switched, wave band switched or fiber switched.  Hence 
   when we talk about diversity we need to specify the layer to which 
   we are referring.  In the previous example we can talk about 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 8] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   diversity with respect to the SONET line layer, wave bands, and/or 
   optical fibers.  A similar situation arises when we consider the 
   definition of node diversity.  For example are we talking with 
   respect to a SONET path layer switch or an optical switch or 
   multiplexer? 
 
     The Shared Risk Link Group concept in reference [6] generalizes 
   the notion of link diversity (general list of numbers).  First it's 
   useful with respect to major outages (cable cuts, natural disasters) 
   to have a few more types of diversity defined: 
    
        1. Cable (conduit) diversity (allows us to know which fibers 
           are in the same cable (conduit).  This helps avoid sending 
           signals over routes that are most vulnerable to "ordinary" 
           cable cuts (technically known as backhoe fades). 
         
        2. Right of Way (ROW) diversity.  This helps avoid sending 
           signals over routes that are subject to larger scale 
           disasters such as ship anchor drags, train derailments, etc. 
         
        3. Geographic Route diversity. This type of diversity can help 
           one avoid sending signals over routes that are subject to 
           various larger scale disasters such as earthquakes, floods, 
           tornadoes, hurricanes, etc.  A route could be approximately 
           described by a piecewise set of latitude/longitude or UTM 
           coordinate pairs. 
         
   We also have a form of link abstraction/summarization via the link 
   bundling concept [7]. 
    
2.3.2   Generalizing Node Diversity 
    
   The concept of a node abstraction associated with GMPLS appears in 
   reference [11] where it is used to generalize the concept of an 
   explicitly routed path.  In this case an abstract node can be a set 
   of IP addresses or an AS number. From the point of view of node 
   diverse routing specific concepts of interest include: 
     1. Nodes, i.e., individual switching elements.  
     2. Switching centers, i.e., a central office or exchange site. 
     3. Cities, or towns that contain more that one switching center. 
     4. Metro areas, or counties 
     5. States,  
     6. Countries, or  
     7. Geographic Regions 
    
2.4 Routing Information Categorization  
   Different applications of inter-domain optical routing call for 
   different types of information to be shared or hidden between 
   domains. In the following we decompose the information that can be 
   transferred via a routing protocol broadly into link/topology 
   information and node/domain information. We further subdivide these 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                                [Page 9] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   categories and will use this taxonomy of routing information when 
   discussing the routing applications.  
 
2.4.1   Link and Topology Related Information 
   -Internal topology- information is information concerning the nodes 
   and links and their connectivity within a domain. This type of 
   information is traditionally shared within a domain via an intra-
   domain (interior gateway) routing protocol such as OSPF or IS-IS. 
   For example the existence of nodes that only have links to other 
   nodes within the domain, i.e., do not have links to other domains, 
   would be strictly internal topology information. These nodes are 
   known as internal nodes, while nodes with links to other domains are 
   known as border nodes. Also included in this information is 
   link/port property information such as whether the link is protected 
   and what type of protection is being used, e.g., linear 1+1, linear 
   1:N, or some type of ring such as a 4F-BLSR [cite T1 document]. 
 
   -Internal Resource- Information is concerned with the bandwidth 
   available on links within a domain and possibly other resource 
   related information. This information plays an important role in 
   path selection within a domain. 
 
   -Inter-Domain Topology- Information is concerned with how the 
   domains are interconnected. This information can be key in inter-
   domain path selection, for example, in determining diverse routes. 
   For the network in Figure 1 this information would let us know that 
   domain A has two distinct links to domain B, domain A has two 
   distinct links to domain C, but that domains B and C are not 
   directly connected via any links.  
 
   -Inter-Domain Resource- Information is concerned with the available 
   bandwidth on inter-domain links. This information is important for 
   inter-domain path selection and inter-domain traffic engineering 
   purposes. For example in Figure 1 this information would give us 
   some kind of bandwidth or capacity measure on the links between 
   domain A and domain B, and the links between domains A and C.  The 
   exact nature of this information may be application/context 
   dependent. 
 
2.4.2   Domain and Node Related Information  
   -Reachability- information tells us what addresses are directly 
   reachable via a particular domain. These systems can be end systems 
   (clients) to the network or nodes within the network depending upon 
   the application/context.  Suppose in domain B of Figure 1 each of 
   the network elements, NE1-NE3, have subtending end systems, and that 
   NE1-NE3 do not represent a valid final destination for a path. Under 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 10] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   this assumption the collection of the  addresses of all these 
   subtending end systems would form the reachability information for 
   domain B. 
   -Subnetwork Capability- information is concerned with the 
   capabilities or features offered by the domain as a whole. This 
   information is used in some applications where sharing the internal 
   topology and resource information is inappropriate. This information 
   can include: (a) Switching capabilities, (b) Protection 
   capabilities, (c) Some kind of overall available capacity measure, 
   (d) Reliability measures. 
   Examples: 
   1.   For example, in the SONET realm, one subnetwork may switch down 
        to an STS-3c granularity while another switches down to an STS-
        1 granularity.  Understanding what types of signals within a 
        SDH/SONET multiplex structure can be switched by a subnetwork 
        is important.  Similar examples of granularity in switching 
        apply to the waveband case. 
   2.   Some networking technologies, particularly SONET/SDH, provide a 
        wide range of standardized protection technologies. But not all 
        domains will offer all protection options.  For example, a 2/4-
        F BLSR based subnetwork could offer extra data traffic, ring 
        protected traffic and non-preemptible unprotected traffic, 
        (NUT)[8], while a mesh network might offer shared SONET line 
        layer linear protection and some form of mesh protection. 
   3.   Some domains may be in locations that have lower incidences of 
        link failure.  Such information could be helpful in computing 
        routes to statistically "share the pain".                                     
 
   -End System Capabilities- information: While properties of the 
   subnetwork are very important when trying to decide which domain to 
   use to access a system (in the case of multi-homing), end systems 
   also posses a wide variety of capabilities. Throwing end system 
   capabilities such as a system's ability to support SONET/SDH virtual 
   concatenation for distribution into a routing protocol may not be 
   that advantageous since it somewhat counters the ability to 
   summarize reachability information.  Detailed end-system information 
   may alternatively be obtained via a directory service or some type 
   of direct query between the end systems. 
    
3  Applications of Inter Domain Optical Routing 
    
3.1 Intra Carrier Applications of Optical Inter Domain Routing  
 
   Intra Carrier inter domain routing refers to a situation where the 
   network that is to be partitioned into areas is under the control of 
   one administrative entity. The main reasons for this partitioning in 
   optical networks stem from scalability, inter-vendor 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 11] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   interoperability, legacy equipment interoperability, and inter-layer 
   partitioning. 
    
3.1.1   Intra-Carrier Scalability 
   As networks grow it is useful to partition a carriers network into 
   separate optical routing domains which share limited or summarized 
   information amongst each other. This reduces the overhead of 
   information exchange across the network as a whole, and reduces the 
   convergence time of routing protocols within a particular area.  
   Hence we see in the inter-carrier scalability application that we 
   will hide or summarize internal topology and resource information, 
   while completely sharing inter-domain topology and resources 
   information so that diverse paths can still be calculated. Note that 
   general domain capabilities/capacity as well as  reachability 
   information would tend to be shared as completely as possible. For 
   example the network shown in Figure 1 can be approximately 
   represented as shown in Figure 2. This summarized network topology 
   only has 4 links whose state need to be advertised in a routing 
   protocol versus 17 links in the original network. Note that we may 
   also advertise the capabilities of the three domains in Figure 2 as 
   opposed to the 12 nodes of Figure 1. In Note that this partitioning 
   into domains can recurse, i.e., we can have multiple levels of 
   routing hierarchy to permit larger and larger networks.  Such was 
   the motivation behind the extensive hierarchical routing capability 
   within ATM's PNNI routing protocol.  The trade off to partitioning 
   into domains for scalability is that less information is available 
   for use in the route selection process which can lead to inefficient 
   utilization of network resources.  On the other hand frequently this 
   partitioning occurs on somewhat "natural" boundaries and as such the 
   potential inefficiencies can be minimized.

   Also in Figure 2 we show the end points of the links between being 
   identified by the triple of (domain, NE address, NE port number). 
   This information is available via the discovery process. Though not 
   strictly necessary including the identification of border nodes in a 
   domain, allowing other nodes to understand whether these links 
   terminate on the same or different nodes is valuable in setting up 
   diverse inter-domain paths. 
   In current intra-domain IP routing protocols, such as OSPF's, a 
   multiple area capability provides for intra-carrier scalability. 
   However, this is currently done by sharing reachability information 
   and using a vector distance method to obtain routes.  This does not 
   discover and propagate inter-domain topology information and hence 
   insufficient information is available for diverse route 
   calculations. 
   When the topology within the domain is approximated or hidden then 
   signaling and call processing at the domain border will receive an 
   approximated (loose) route and the border node or signaling entity 
   must then translate this to a precise route through the domain.  
   Hence there is some linkage between multi-domain connection control 
   and inter-area/inter-domain routing. 
    
3.1.2   Intra-Carrier Inter-vendor 
   An important application of intra-carrier optical routing is the 
   intra-carrier inter-vendor scenario. From a carrier’s perspective, 
   the use of domains provides a clean way to isolate clouds of 
   equipment belonging to different vendors, while at the same time 
   allowing for interoperability between the vendors. 
   An advantage of this method is that it allows the vendors complete 
   freedom to use any combination of routing protocols or traditional 
   management-based methods to propagate topology and resources 
   internal to their domains. In other words, the routing entity in 
   each domain could obtain this information either by participating in 
   a routing protocol like OSPF, or by querying each NE via an EMS, or 
   by simply having the required information manually configured into 
   it. 
    
   Note that the routing entity shown in each vendor’s cloud in Figure 
   3 is in reality an abstract representation of the routing 
   intelligence within the vendor cloud. This intelligence may either 
   be implemented in a distributed way, by having a routing protocol 
   running at each NE, or in a centralized way, through the use of an 
   intelligent, centralized routing entity that communicates with the 
   individual NE’s (either via a protocol or by querying individual

   elements) to retrieve connectivity and resource information that it 
   uses to build a complete topology and resource map of the domain. 
   Therefore, vendors may use different protocols as the primary option 
   between their own devices, adding specialized features or optimizing 
   their performance based on their choice of protocol.

            Figure 3.  Intra-Carrier Inter-vendor routing domains 
   Even if it is a centralized entity, the routing entity could still 
   be run on a given NE in the vendor cloud. In other words, these 
   entities could be distributed, or centralized onto a single node, or 
   independent of any of the nodes.  In ATM's PNNI protocol, for 
   example, this was centralized on a node elected as the  "peer group 
   leader".  In the inter-vendor case, it can be particularly 
   advantageous to centralize this so that the flow of information can 
   be monitored.  A centralized routing entity could apply flooding and 
   summarization mechanisms as if it is a switching system.  Since this 
   is optical rather than IP routing, signaling would be carried by a 
   control channel between the routing entity and the neighboring 
   system, rather than being carried over the data links. The functions 
   of the routing entity include:  (a) direct reachability exchange 
   (that is, which NE’s can be directly reached from this domain, (b) 
   verification of area connectedness (that is, understanding how the 
   two domains are interconnected), (c) area/domain topology (possibly 
   summarized) exchange and updates, and (d) topology updates 
   concerning other domains/areas.

   When a carrier partitions its network for inter-vendor 
   interoperability as described above, it may still share information 
   about the internal topology of the domains in some standardized form 
   that has been agreed upon between the vendors. Although one option 
   is to force both vendors to adopt a new common protocol, another is 
   to require that only a minimum subset of reachability/topology 
   information be shared between the vendor clouds. The latter option 
   helps during fault situations, by providing fault isolation at the 
   domain boundaries. It prevents an outage in a domain composed of one 
   vendor’s equipment from causing a reaction in an adjacent domain 
   composed of another vendor’s equipment, thus preventing a situation 
   that would typically degenerate into a process known as “finger 
   pointing” between the two vendors. 
 
   The setup described above takes into account the three most 
   important sub-cases of inter-carrier inter-vendor partitioning: 
        a. The first is where both vendor domains run distributed 
        routing protocols. This is the most flexible case, and is the 
        situation when new equipment capable of running such protocols 
        is deployed.  
         
        b. The second is where the optical subnetworks or domains 
        (which includes a large number of existing installations) do 
        not run any internal routing protocol (because the NE’s are not 
        capable of doing so), relying instead on EMS-based topology 
        discovery/resource management. In this case, interoperability 
        with other vendor clouds can be realized by having the routing 
        entity run as a separate software entity with access to the 
        appropriate information. These entities may exchange routing 
        proxy addresses through the neighbor discovery protocol, and 
        then exchange routing information (proxying for the entire 
        domain) with each other. The basic advantage here is that even 
        though the vendor specific element management system (EMS) 
        knows the topology of its subnetwork, it is far easier to get 
        an inter-domain routing protocol to share information than 
        trying to get the separate vendors management systems to 
        communicate.    
        c.  The third is where one domain has a centralized routing 
        entity, while the other runs a distributed routing protocol. 
        Once again, the neighbor discovery process between the area 
        border NE’s could be used to advertise the address of the 
        routing entity. 
    
3.1.3   Inter-Layer Partitioning  
   In transport networks layering is a part of the multiplex and OA&M 
   structure of the signals, playing a role in multiplexing, monitoring 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 15] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   and general link management.  Layering in the transport network is 
   defined in fairly abstract terms in [G.805] and the concepts are 
   applied to SDH in [G.803].  As explained in a recent ITU SG15 
   document (WD45 Q.14/15) not all the layers in the transport network 
   are of interest to the control plane, or to routing in particular. 
   Some layers may not contain active switching elements, however this 
   does not mean that information flow concerning a non-switching layer 
   is not valuable in routing. For example in [GB-WDM-SRLG] static WDM 
   layer information was used to set the SRLGs for SONET lines (i.e., 
   information passed around by a link state protocol operating at the 
   SONET line layer). It should be noted that much of the information 
   available from non-switching layers relates to performance 
   monitoring and fault management.  
    
   In this situation the network is partitioned into sub-networks that 
   operate at different switching layers. One reason for doing this is 
   that not all the information from one layer is necessary or relevant 
   to another layer.  For example, between transparent optical switches 
   and SDH/SONET path (VC) layer switches, the optical switches have no 
   direct use for the SONET layer information. In addition optical 
   networks may keep a lot more physical layer information (such as the 
   properties of every optical amplifier on a WDM span) that is of no 
   use to the SONET layer.  One again this promotes scalability, but 
   also simplifies the implementation by reducing inter-layer 
   information transfer to that which is actually useful. 
    
   Now in network planning it is very useful to have a view of the 
   current higher layer traffic matrix [9] being satisfied and higher 
   layer traffic trend measurements over time.  Although we can 
   somewhat see this in higher layer resource status changes over time, 
   this represents a link level view when we really desire the trend 
   (change in time) of the traffic matrices between sites.  How this 
   information gets distributed is an open issue. Currently individual 
   nodes in a GMPLS network know only about connections that they 
   source or sink. Network planning is generally a longer time horizon 
   process than even traffic engineering hence it is an open question 
   as to whether this would ever be a useful function to incorporate 
   into a network element. 
    
   Now looking the other way is initially simpler, i.e., it is easier 
   to ask: what can a higher layer use for path selection/computation 
   from a lower layer. The first item that springs to mind is diversity 
   information. For example in setting up a SONET STS-1 path we can use 
   information from a WDM system concerning which  SONET lines share 
   the same WDM fiber.  This is information, however, is already 
   abstracted into routing protocols via SRLG concept. Other

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   information from a lower layer is of questionable value since it 
   tends to be technology specific and puts more and more burden on the 
   upper layer to be able to effectively understand and use this 
   information. 
    
3.1.4   Interaction with IP Layer Routing 
   The applicability of IP-based routing protocols has, over the years, 
   been constantly expanded to increasingly more circuit-oriented 
   layers. The community began with pure datagram routing, gradually 
   expanded to cover virtual-circuit switched packet routing (for e.g., 
   MPLS), and is finally looking at the application of routing 
   protocols to real circuit switching, e.g. the optical layer. 
    
   However, as pointed out earlier in this document, it is not clear 
   that the different layers should necessarily share the same instance 
   of the routing protocols. Indeed, there may be significant reasons 
   for not doing so and many carrier tend to partition there networks 
   along switching layer boundaries. For example, IP-layer reachability 
   information is not particularly useful for the optical layer, so it 
   seems an overkill to burden the optical equipment with storing and 
   distributing that information. (It is an extra expense on memory and 
   processing for information that the optical layer does not really 
   care about, so there is little incentive for a vendor to want to do 
   so.) Likewise, information on physical plant (fibers, conduits, 
   ducts) diversity, which is crucial at the optical transport layer, 
   is very unlikely to be used directly by the IP layer. So, it would 
   be quite wasteful of resources to burden the IP layer routing with 
   distributing and manipulating this information. Thus, the extent of 
   interaction or integration with IP layer routing (if any) requires 
   careful consideration. 
    
3.1.5   Inter-Business Unit  
    
   A slightly different but interesting application of intra-carrier 
   optical routing occurs in the intra-carrier inter-business unit 
   scenario. This arises because a carrier often has multiple 
   administrative domains, with groups of administrative domains being 
   under the purview of independent BU’s within the carrier. 
    
   Note that different BU’s represent independent cost centers with 
   their own profit objectives and sales targets. As a result, while 
   the BU’s can profitably share topology information and would like to 
   do so, they may not be so inclined to advertise the details of their 
   resource usage into domains belonging to other BUs.  Since each BU 
   has its own revenue targets, advertising detailed resource 
   availability information to other, potentially competing, BUs can 
   have a negative impact on a BUs revenue generation. This is because 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 17] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   the knowledge of available resources in one BU may enable other BUs 
   within the carrier to requisition capacity from this BU. This would 
   force the BU in question to yield to their request, possibly at the 
   expense of selling capacity to more profitable, external, revenue 
   generating customers. 
   Thus, this scenario is likely to have an additional dimension of 
   information sharing, namely, policy-based information sharing, which 
   does not apply to the other cases that we have discussed so far. 
    
   Two examples where the inter-business unit scenario could become 
   important are in the case of metro-core-metro networks within a 
   given carrier, and in the case of regional networks within a 
   carrier. 
    
    In the metro-core-metro situation, such as the one depicted in  
   resource sharing between them.

   Figure 4, the metro network domains could be under the jurisdiction

   In this case, for example, it is possible that the metro BU, armed 
   with resource availability information about the core BU’s domains, 
   could requisition capacity from the core network when needed. This 
   may harm the core network’s profit goals, because they may not be 
   able to charge an internal customer the same rates that they could 
   charge for the same capacity from an external customer, thus 
   motivating the need for selective, policy-based resource sharing

3.2 Inter-Carrier Inter-Domain Optical Routing  
    
   In this case we are talking about dealing with outside entities, 
   i.e., between service providers.  There may be a range of levels of 
   trust here; for example there might be some level of trust between 
   two providers that have formed a marketing alliance or have some 
   other form of business relationship. In general, however, trust can 
   not be assumed. In this case, all the concerns of revealing too much 
   information about one's network come into play.  However, not 
   revealing enough, say about diversity capabilities may also lead 
   customers elsewhere. Also there are some other security issues not 
   seen before. For example, in route distribution one carrier might 
   not be inclined to pass on routing information that could point the 
   way to competitive alternatives. This impacts the methods for route 
   updates, etc. 
 
   With the interest in bandwidth trading [10] we can also look at this 
   as an advertisement of network connectivity and capability with of 
   course any "warts" covered up. This would include reliance on other 
   carrier for fibers or lambdas.  Also a fair amount of details such 
   as "unused capacity" would not be advertised since this maybe 
   financially sensitive information. 
    
   Private line pricing today is based primarily on the service itself 
   (bandwidth, end-points, etc.) and the holding time, and there is no 
   reason to expect that this will change. When multiple service 
   providers are involved the algorithm for dividing up the revenue 
   stream (which can be quite large even for a single connection) must 
   be explicit by connect time. This could be done off-line or could be 
   done at connect time. In either case, the entity or entities doing 
   the routing will need to take provider pricing structures into 
   account whenever there is a choice between providers that needs to 
   be made. The routing logic could do this explicitly if the prices 
   are captured in the advertised metrics or some other advertised 
   data; alternatively it could be done by some sort of policy control, 
   as it is today by BGP. 
    
   The essence of bandwidth trading is the existence of competing price 
   structures that are known to the entity deciding which competitor to 
   use.  It is possible to create plausible bandwidth trading scenarios 
   involving the UNI, the NNI, or both. If the NNI is involved, these 
   price structures will need to be established across it. The 
   situation is further complicated by the fact that bandwidth trading 
   could be realized using any one of a number of business models, each 
   with its own information requirements. To give two examples: If an 
   auction model were used the buyer might repeatedly broadcast the 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 20] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   lowest bid received to date and solicit lower bids from the 
   competing providers. On the other hand, if there were a more formal 
   market the providers might post their asking prices in some public 
   fashion and a buyer would be matched by some third party with the 
   lowest offer. 
     
   In the inter-carrier case notions of hierarchy seem rather 
   sensitive, i.e., he who controls the summarization and advertisement 
   may have an undue advantage over competitors.  In addition, a 
   "bandwidth aggregator" may want to advertise capabilities that he 
   has put together via deals with multiple carriers... 
    
   Notes: We can attempt to extend the SRLG concept to links between 
   ASs but we will need the two ASs to agree on the meaning and number 
   of the list of 32 bit integers that comprise the SRLG, i.e., 
   previously the SRLG concept was one of AS scope.  And this is also 
   where things get tricky since it may not be possible to distinguish 
   diverse routes based upon differing path vectors (i.e., AS number 
   traversal list).  The reason for this is due the fact that many 
   carriers "fill out" their networks by renting either dark fiber or 
   "lambdas" from a WDM system and hence although the path vectors may 
   be AS diverse they may not even be fiber diverse. 
    
   Hence there is a need for sharing of diversity information or 
   constraints between ASs when setting up diverse connections across 
   multiple ASs.  This gets us somewhat into a quandary over which 
   information needs to be public and how to coordinate its 
   distribution.  In this sense geographic link information may be the 
   simplest and least contentious to get various players to disclose 
   and standardize. 
    
   Notes:  (1) The real issue is consistency between the cloud/AS’s 
   since in many cases they are sharing conduit, ROW, etc.  Getting 
   this to happen could be very problematic. It would be preferable to 
   see a diversity option that doesn’t require this. For example, 
   ensure that there is diversity within each cloud and then do 
   restoration separately within each cloud. (2)  See the definition of 
   SRLG in the Carrier Requirements – an equivalence class of links, 
   the extent of violation, and the level. (3) Flexibility in defining 
   the level of violation seems very desirable – these historically 
   have drifted in time. There are many others – eg, if the shared 
   resources are SPRING protected that’s less of a problem than 
   otherwise. 
    
   Notes: Participation in the inter-domain network carries constraints 
   on the carriers. First, in order to participate, each provider 
   network MUST be willing to advertise the destinations that are 
   reachable through his network at each entry point and advertise the 
   formats available. Without providing such information, there is 
   little motivation to participate since it is unlikely that others 
   will be able to access services of which they are not aware. Second, 
   every participating carriers MUST agree to fairly include the 
   information made available by every other carrier so that each

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   carrier has an equal opportunity to provide services. There may be 
   specific exceptions, but the carrier claiming those exceptions MUST 
   advertise the exceptions themselves. In this manner, other carriers 
   that might otherwise be aware of distant services can be prompted to 
   seek those services manually.  Note a combination of minimal 
   required information transferred with deferral to the originating 
   subnetwork along with some basic security mechanisms such as 
   integrity and non-repudiation may be useful in helping organizations 
   to "play nice". 
    
3.3 Multi-Domain Connection Control 
    
   MPLS’ loose routing capability allows one to specify a route for an 
   optical connection in terms of a sequence of optical AS numbers.  
   This, for example, is handled via RSVP-TE’s abstract node concept 
   [11]. Currently there is nothing in the GMPLS signaling 
   specification that differentiates between intra AS boundaries, i.e., 
   between two neighbor optical LSRs in the same AS, and inter AS 
   boundaries, i.e. between two neighbor optical LSRs in different ASs.  
   Note that these same notions can apply to separate routing domains 
   within an AS. There may, however, be some useful reasons for 
   differentiating these two cases: 
    
         1. Separation of signaling domains, 
         2. Separation of protection domains. 
    
   While routing protocols (used for their topology information) in the 
   optical case are not "service impacting", signaling protocols most 
   certainly are.  It is desirable to build some type of "wall" between 
   optical ASs so that faults in one that lead to "signaling storms" do 
   not get propagated to other ASs.  Note that the same motivation 
   applies for isolating other kinds of clouds, like vendors specific 
   ones. 
    
   The natural situation where "signaling storms" would be most likely 
   to arise is during network restoration signaling, i.e., signaling to 
   recover connections during major network outages, e.g., natural 
   disasters etc. In this case it may be very advantageous to break up 
   general source reroute forms of restoration into per domain segments 
   or to start reroute at domain boundaries rather than all the way 
   back at the originating node. Note that this has the advantage of 
   reducing the need for globally consistent SRLG’s. (See earlier SRLG 
   comment.) Such a capability requires some loose coordination between 
   the local, intermediate and global protection mechanisms [12].  This 
   is typically implemented via hold off timers, i.e., one layer of 
   protection will not attempt restoration until a more fundamental 
   (local) form has been given a chance to recover the connection [12].  
    
   In other words, prevention of restoration related signaling storms 
   may require the breaking up of a large network into multiple 
   signaling (and hence routing) domains. These domains could be within 
   the same AS.

4  Multiple Layers of Routing 
 
4.1 Layers in Transport Networks  
    
   In transport networks layering is a part of the multiplex and OA&M 
   structure of the signals, playing a role in multiplexing, monitoring 
   and general link management.  Layering in the transport network is 
   defined in fairly abstract terms in [G.805] and the concepts are 
   applied to SDH in [G.803].  As explained in a recent ITU SG15 
   document (WD45 Q.14/15) not all the layers in the transport network 
   are of interest to the control plane, or to routing in particular.  
    
   Some layers may not contain active switching elements, however this 
   does not mean that information flow concerning a non-switching layer 
   is not valuable in routing. For example in [GB-WDM-SRLG] static WDM 
   layer information was used to set the SRLGs for SONET lines (i.e., 
   information passed around by a link state protocol operating at the 
   SONET line layer). It should be noted that much of the information 
   available from non-switching layers relates to performance 
   monitoring and fault management. Hence work in this area within 
   CCAMP should take into account this layered approach. 
    
   Note that this is distinct from the layer idea used in the 7-layer 
   OSI model or IP layer model. In the IP model, the term Layer means 
   that, for example, the Application Layer entity requests services 
   for delivering a message to an entity on another computer and it 
   contacts the Transport Layer service, which in turn contacts the 
   Internet Layer. Lower layers are successively contacted until an 
   end-to-end service is provided. A key concept is that the 
   Application Layer cannot (or rather should not) contact the Internet 
   Layer directly. In this model all the "layers" discussed in this 
   document would lie in the "physical layer" (from an IP perspective). 
     
 
4.2 Layer Integration  
 
   As previously discussed, there are multiple layers of signals 
   included in what in the IP model one would call the Physical Layer. 
   One could separate the layers by creating sublayers in the Physical 
   Layer.  For example, sublayers in the Physical Layer might be, top 
   to bottom: LOVCs, HOVCs, and Lambdas. If a system supports only one 
   of the three, then isolation of the sublayers is a given; it's 
   geographical. But there are systems which will support more than one 
   physical sublayer, therefore, it is necessary to establish whether 
   or not there is a need to isolate the sublayers in the same manner. 
   Or put another way is there a reason to "integrate" the sublayers 
   for the purposes of routing (topology dissemination). 
    
   If they are isolated, then there will be separate topological models 
   for each sublayer: one mesh for the LOVC, one for the HOVC, one for 
   the Lambda, and possibly others. The appropriate way to access a 
   sublayer is via the use of sublayer SAPs (service access points). 
   For example, in this way, one may find that use of Lambdas is more 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 23] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   efficient because each sublayer can assess the availability of 
   services at its own layer before searching for coarser-granularity 
   services. On the other hand, the control plane must accommodate 
   three separate routing protocols, or at least three separate 
   instances of the same routing protocol, all operating at both intra 
   and inter-domain level.  
    
   Section 4.4.2, herein, states "For transport across a SONET network, 
   the lower order signals must be multiplexed into a non-concatenated 
   higher order signal." Given that this is true, LOVCs are not routed 
   independently, but only as tributaries of HOVCs. In addition in the 
   SDH hierarchy there is a signal, VC3, that can be treated 
   (multiplexed) as either a LOVC or a HOVC.  With this tight and 
   somewhat confused coupling of these layers it may beneficial to 
   sometimes combine them into the same route protocol instance.  
    
   Use of the terms LOVC and HOVC infers that all of the services to be 
   supported by inter-domain routing are those formally associated with 
   the terms in SONET and SDH standards. However, among the optical 
   systems emerging in today’s market are rate and format independent 
   systems, which claim to offer services that do not rely on SONET/SDH 
   framing. Their intent is to support Ethernet, ATM, and OTN framing 
   without the need for electronics specifically targeted at the signal 
   of interest. The question arises whether or not to include these 
   "clear channel" services as a separate sublayer of the Physical 
   Layer.  
    
   The alternative to separate routing protocols per sublayer is the 
   original notion behind GMPLS routing and the forwarding adjaciency 
   concept [13]. Rather than separating the route protocols into 
   separate layers (or sublayers) with distinct topologies, each ONE 
   would advertise the services it can provide, along with its topology 
   information. For example, a ONE (optical network element) might 
   advertise that it carries a route to node A with STS-N service and 
   clear-channel lambda service and carries multiple routes to node B 
   with STS-N service. It might, alternatively, advertise its entire 
   network with summarized link capacity information for every included 
   link. Neighboring carriers would, implicitly, be allowed to 
   summarize that information for internal advertisement via its IGP. 
   Further consideration could be given to a query service, where a 
   carrier advertises the geographical area it serves without detailed 
   reachability or capacity information. A second carrier desiring 
   service could query the first carrier as to reachability for a 
   specific destination, and the first carrier would respond with 
   availability and capacity information. 
 
   Integrating multiple layers into the same routing protocol instance 
   leaves us fewer routing protocols to manage. The downside of this is 
   that more information must be exchanged via this routing protocol 
   and more network elements participate in this single instance of the 
   routing protocol which can lead to scalability concerns. If the 
   equipment working on the different sublayers comes from different 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 24] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   vendors there would be little incentive to integrate multiple layers 
   into the routing protocol for a single layer product.   
   Regardless of whether multiple layers are integrated into the same 
   routing protocol instance it can be very useful to share information 
   between layers as illustrated by the following examples: 
    
    
        o Drop side links between layers: Capabilities of the links 
          that are between the (client and server) layers need to be 
          propagated into the routing protocol. 
        o Summarize link capabilities: Summarizing the server layer 
          capabilities in the client layer will reduce the amount of 
          information required for multi-layer constraint based path 
          computation. 
        o Send only that are required: Sending only the capabilities 
          that are useful in the constraint path computation in the 
          client layer. 
    
    
4.3 Interaction with IP Layer Routing  
    
   The applicability of IP-based routing protocols has, over the years, 
   been constantly expanded to increasingly more circuit-oriented 
   layers. The community began with pure datagram routing, gradually 
   expanded to cover virtual-circuit switched packet routing (for e.g., 
   MPLS), and is finally looking at the application of routing 
   protocols to real circuit switching, e.g. the optical layer. 
    
   However, as pointed out earlier in this document, it is not clear 
   that the different layers should necessarily share the same instance 
   of the IP routing protocols. Indeed, there may be significant 
   reasons for not doing so. For example, IP-layer reachability 
   information is not particularly useful for the optical layer, so it 
   seems an overkill to burden the optical equipment with storing and 
   distributing that information. (It is an extra expense on memory and 
   processing for information that the optical layer does not really 
   care about, so there is little incentive for a vendor to want to do 
   so.) Likewise, information on physical plant (fibers, conduits, 
   ducts) diversity, which is crucial at the optical transport layer, 
   is very unlikely to be used directly by the IP layer. So, it would 
   be quite wasteful of resources to burden the IP layer routing with 
   distributing and manipulating this information. 
    
   Thus, the extent of interaction or integration with IP layer routing 
   (if any) requires careful consideration. 
    
5  Existing Routing Protocol Applicability 
    
   Here we look at the applicability of OSPF,IS-IS PNNI and BGP to 
   various aspects of the general optical inter domain routing problem.  
   All protocols provide reachability information. The questions to be 
   investigated are how they deal with partitioning the network,

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   diverse routing, summarized/abstracted topology information sharing, 
   and suitability for the inter-domain environment. 
    
5.1 OSPF 
   OSPF stands for Open Shortest Path First, an IP interior routing 
   protocol defined by the IETF as documented as the RFC2328. OSPF uses 
   the link state algorithm. OSPF was originally defined to construct 
   shortest path tree in IP networks to forward IP datagram in hop-by-
   hop manner in IPv4 addressing space. The OSPF is capable of scaling 
   to a very large networks by partitioning networks into areas. Each 
   OSPF area is identified by a unique identifier called Area ID. The 
   default area is called backbone area with the Area ID as zero. A 
   router with interfaces with multiple OSPF areas is called Area 
   Border Router (ABR). The topology information including node, links 
   and addresses belonging to a single area are advertised throughout 
   that area but not beyond. Only reachability of address and address 
   prefix from one area may be exported to other areas possibly with 
   summarization or policy-based suppression. A shortest path tree is 
   constructed at each router for each of the attached OSPF area. IP 
   datagram destined to other areas is forwarded via the ABR. An OSPF 
   router that has interface outside of an OSPF domain is called 
   Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR). An ASBR may import 
   reachability information from outside the AS and IP datagram in and 
   out of an OSPF domain is via the ASBR.  
   There have been numerous RFCs and IETF drafts that propose 
   extensions and enhancement to the RFC2328 where the features include 
   the following: 
     1. The OSPF NSSA Option (RFC 1587). 
     2. OSPF Database Overflow (RFC 1765)

                domain. 
    
   ASBR         Autonomous System Boundary Router. An ASBR is an OSPF  
                node that has interface with routers in other AS, or is 
                capable of importing IP routes from non-OSPF sources. 
    
   Backup Designated Router    There is a single BDR elected in OSPF

                               role of the DR when the original DR 
                               fails.

   Stub Area    In OSPF, AS external LSA is flooded throughout all 
                areas that belong to the same AS. An OSPF area may 
                optionally be specified as a stub area so that no AS 
                external LSA flooded into that area. 
                                 
   Virtual Link                                 A logical point-to-point link that connects two 
                       OSPF ABRs. 
    
5.1.2   Neighbor/Adjacency Discovery 
   The neighbor and adjacency mean different things in OSPF although 
   both describe the relationship between two inter-connected OSPF 
   nodes. The inter-connection between OSPF nodes includes both 
   physical and logical context. In particular, the inter-connection 
   between two adjacent OSPF neighbors can be realized by either 
   physical cable or virtual link. The neighbor relationship is at the 
   IP layer for OSPF. If we can use OSPF or OSPF-like IP based routing 
   protocol for optical networks, that implies we still need control 
   plane at the layer-3. 
   The OSPF neighbor relationship describes the communication using 
   OSPF Hello protocol between a pair of inter-connected OSPF nodes. 
   Note the peer relationship is regardless of the underlined interface 
   type; e.g., on a point-to-point interface, there is a single pair of 
   OSPF nodes communicating using Hello protocol and on a broadcast 
   network interface such as Ethernet, the neighbor relationship 
   applies to each pair of OSPF nodes on that Ethernet. One of the

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   usages of the OSPF neighbor relationship is to monitor the bi-
   directional communication status between a pair of OSPF nodes, 
   although on the multi-access networks, the neighbor relationship is 
   also used for the election of OSPF Designated Router and Backup 
   Designated Router.  Note that this is an "IP layer peer" 
   relationship.  One important item to note is that in the optical 
   world we typically have much faster and more accurate methods to 
   monitor the health of the communications between the two nodes. This 
   is also true for some of the non-optical networks even on the 
   Ethernet. However, all existing routing protocols (OSPF, PNNI, IS-
   IS, etc.) have their own link healthy checking mechanism. What 
   happens is if the link layer fails, the routing protocol will get 
   notification with proper handling before its own mechanism kicks in. 
   But if the failure not due to the lower layer, the protocol’s 
   mechanism will be used. 
   The OSPF adjacency specifies a relationship between a pair of OSPF 
   nodes that have 2-way communication neighbor relationship as whether 
   to exchange OSPF link state information between them. Note the 
   adjacency relationship is always formed between the two inter-
   connected nodes on a point-to-point network interface, and is also 
   so between any pair of nodes on a multi-access network except those 
   where none of them is either Backup Designated Router or Designated 
   Router. 
   The OSPF link state information includes the addresses, nodes, 
   links, traffic-engineering parameters that belong to all nodes in a 
   single OSPF area. Information exchanged between separate OSPF areas 
   is only limited to the addresses. The IETF may decide if and how to 
   exchange information related to the traffic-engineering parameters 
   between OSPF areas. 
   Note the neighbor and adjacency are required elements commonly exist 
   in any link-state algorithm based routing protocols. Although they 
   are associated with OSPF nodes at one-hop away (note the “hop” is 
   with logical context), the link state information that exchanged 
   using the protocol mechanism is associated with a much larger 
   network segment, and that is called Area in OSPF. This is important 
   since in the optical networks, there might require other neighbor 
   information and its exchange between inter-connected nodes, such as 
   those on the same optical ring; it is recommended that separate 
   protocol(s) be used for that purpose for the reasons with two-fold. 
   First, it is desirable to separate specific technology such as 
   SONET, DWDM, ADM etc. from routing protocol that operates at the 
   networking layer. Second, the information that related to the 
   underlined technology tends to be with local significance, not 
   network-wide.

5.1.3   Addressing & Reachability 
   OSPF is an interior routing protocol used for IP networks. The OSPF 
   version 2 supports IPv4 addressing only and OSPF version 3 (work-in-
   progress) supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing. There is a network 
   mask associated with an IP address. 
   In IP networks, an address or address prefix is associated with 
   entities that include the following: 
 
     1. Host-oriented device, including routers, switches, 
        workstations, etc., and called host address. 
     2. Network segment called subnet, and called IP subnet address.  
     3. Network interface that associated with a NE including routers, 
        switches, etc., and called interface IP address. 
   
   OSPF is capable of advertising IP addresses that associated with all 
   the above. Within a single OSPF area, addresses that associated with 
   nodes, interfaces, and subnets within that area are advertised 
   throughout that area with no summarization, along with other link 
   state information. This is important such that routing path for any 
   reachable address can be calculated in very optimized fashion. 
   On the other hand, OSPF is capable of summarizing addresses that 
   associated with one area before advertising them to other areas. In 
   addition, OSPF can summarize addresses and selectively (based on 
   administrative policies) advertising them from one Autonomous System 
   (AS) to others via inter-domain routing protocols such as BGP-4. 
   For reachable addresses across boundaries topology of OSPF areas or 
   AS, the routing path for them may or may not be optimized due to the 
   lack of information since the OSPF link state advertisements not 
   across those boundaries.  
5.1.4   Topology Discovery & Dissemination 
   The information that contained in the link state advertisements 
   includes three categories as follows: 
     1. Reachability of IP addresses and IP subnets (discussed in the 
        Section 2.1.2) 
     2. Traffic engineering parameters (discussed in the Section 2.1.4) 
     3. Network topology including OSPF nodes, links and their 
        connectivity (discussed in this section) 
   The topology related link state advertisements only flow within a 
   single OSPF area but not beyond. In a single OSPF area, each node 
   knows all the other nodes, their links and connectivity without any 
   aggregation. This is the basis for routing path optimization within 
   a single OSPF area. 
   Between OSPF areas, there is no topology related link state 
   advertisements exchange. The only information across the OSPF area 
   boundary is the reachability of the IP addresses and IP subnets via 
   OSPF Area Border Routers. This scenario is also true across OSPF 
   domains where the reachability is via OSPF Autonomous System 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 29] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   Boundary Routers. Therefore, while OSPF is a link-state algorithm 
   based routing protocol, it is only true within an OSPF area and at 
   the next higher level of the hierarchy it can only perform distance 
   vector algorithm based routing.  This will most likely be one of the 
   major shortcomings for OSPF to be used for optical networks where if 
   an optical network needs to scale to very large and be partitioned 
   into OSPF areas, there will be no topology information at all across 
   the area boundary. 
5.1.5   Resources 
   The OSPF was originally defined for routing IP packets with best 
   effort. The MPLS/GMPLS extensions to the OSPF add the ability for 
   OSPF to advertise traffic engineering parameters using opaque Link 
   State Advertisements. 
   The traffic engineering parameters advertised by OSPF are associated 
   with OSPF links that can carry user traffic. Currently the set of 
   engineering parameters including the following: 
     1. Maximum link bandwidth 
     2. Available link bandwidth (with 8 priority levels) 
     3. Traffic engineering metric 
     4. Administrative class 
     5. Protection type 
     6. Shared risk link group 
   Like the scope of the topology link state advertisements, the 
   advertising for traffic engineering information is also restricted 
   within a single OSPF area. This makes the constraints based routing 
   using OSPF very effective within a single OSPF area but not beyond. 
   This is another major shortcoming of OSPF that needs to be 
   considered for using OSPF in the optical networks. 
5.1.6   General Protocol Properties 
   This section briefly discusses the general protocol properties of 
   the OSPF in the specific areas as in the following sections. 

5.1.6.1 System Overhead 
   The memory required to support OSPF operation is a variable 
   depending on several factors including the following: 
     1. Whether the node is an ABR or not – ABR usually consumes more 
        memory since it needs to maintain database for multiple OSPF 
        areas. 
     2. Whether the node is an ASBR or not - ASBR may also consume more 
        memory since it needs to store routes obtained from other 
        routing protocols such as BGP-4. 
     3. The number of nodes and links within each OSPF area. 
     4. The number of reachable addresses within a single OSPF area, 
        imported from other areas and other AS. 
     5. The amount of the traffic engineering information within an 
        OSPF area.  
 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 30] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   Most of the OSPF routing messages are re-transmittable driven by the 
   associated timers in the order of seconds and the timer values are 
   configurable.  

5.1.6.2 Network Resource Overhead 
   OSPF routing messages can either be carried in-band, out-band or 
   out-of-fiber. The consumption of the network resources depend on 
   factors including the following: 
 
  1. The amount of the routing messages that need to be put on the wire 
     depends on factors that similar to those listed above (Section 
     2.1.7.1) for the memory consumption. 
   
  2. Interface type – it is visible that during transit time (election 
     of (Backup) Designate Router, topology change, etc.), the OSPF 
     routing messages on interfaces of multi-access networks (Ethernet, 
     etc.) are very large and the actual amount depending on the 
     implementation, the number of routers on the subnet, etc. 
    
  3. OSPF packets – 
 
        Most of the OSPF packets as defined in the RFC 2328([OSPF1])are 
        very compact that saves the bandwidth consumption on the wire. 
    
        The OSPF address advertising LSA (type 3 and 5) only allows to 
        contain one single reachable address. This is not economic at 
        all. 
    
        Some of the traffic engineering parameters contained in the 
        OSPF opaque LSA are not with compact format such as bandwidth 
        based on priority. 
 
   Consideration needs to be taken in this regard since in the optical 
   networks, control channels are usually out-of-band or out-of-fiber, 
   where there may not always be large quantity of bandwidth available 
   for routing messages. 
           

5.1.6.3 Reliability 
   OSPF does not have re-start capability originally other than re-
   build its routing database from scratch upon re-start. This fact 
   cannot be accepted by most of the carrier-class networks today. 
   Note however, that routing protocols for the optical network are not 
   service impacting in the way that they are for IP datagram routing.  
   Hence, for connection/circuit based networks, the routing protocol’s 
   re-start capability may not be critical as in the datagram networks. 
   The only scenario is – if we use signaling protocol to setup

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   circuits, and if we also (sometimes) have to use the signaling 
   protocol to re-route failed circuits, there will be a busy routing 
   scenario where the routing protocol’s re-start appears important. 
   However, the IETF has a few proposals to improve this and in 
   particular the proposal as described in the [OSPF5] allows a 
   graceful re-start along with backward compatibility. 
5.1.7   Scaling Capability 
   OSPF is capable of scaling and can handle large-scale IP networks. 
   The scalability of a routing protocol is achieved by reducing the 
   amount of the routing information exchanged between network 
   segments. The reduction of the routing messages will certainly have 
   impact on the routing efficiency and optimization. The kind of 
   information reduction and their impact for OSPF are as follows: 
     1. Address summarization – as described in the Section 2.1.2, OSPF 
        is capable of performing address summarization at the area 
        boundary and Autonomous System boundary. As a result, the 
        amount of the addresses that advertised throughout the IP 
        networks is greatly reduced. The reduction of the address 
        advertisement does not affect the reachability since the 
        routing path across OSPF areas and Autonomous Systems is via 
        OSPF Area Border Router and Autonomous System Boundary Router, 
        respectively. 
     2. Topology aggregation – as described in the Section 2.1.3, OSPF 
        is capable of topology aggregation, but to the extreme, i.e., 
        there is no topology information exchange between OSPF areas 
        and Autonomous Systems at all. This greatly reduces the amount 
        of the advertisements throughout the IP networks but with a big 
        price, i.e., routing path across the OSPF areas or Autonomous 
        Systems will most unlikely be optimized. 
     3. Traffic engineering information aggregation – as described in 
        the Section 2.1.4, there is no traffic engineering information 
        exchange between OSPF areas and Autonomous Systems as defined 
        in current OSPF TE extensions. As a result, the scaling purpose 
        is achieved but the routing with traffic engineering 
        requirements across OSPF areas or Autonomous Systems is very 
        inefficient or ineffective. 
     4. OSPF has another feature that limits the flooding of the Link 
        State Advertisements (LSA) – an OSPF area can be configured as 
        a so-called Stub Area and as such no AS-based LSA is allowed to 
        flow into it. The AS-based LSA includes the OSPF type 5 LSA 
        only as today. The OSPF type 5 LSA contains reachable addresses 
        from other Autonomous Systems; the communication between other 
        AS and a stub area is via the ABR(s) that attach to the stub 
        area. 
   The address summarization capability of OSPF is very valuable. The 
   topology aggregation behavior of OSPF does not sound great in multi-

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   area operation especially for traffic engineering based 
   applications. 
5.1.8   Interworking Capability 
   OSPF cannot interwork with any other protocol using any common 
   protocol messages. However, OSPF as an IP routing protocol is 
   capable of interworking in terms of sharing and exchanging IP 
   reachability information as follows: 
     1. OSPF can operate together with any other IP routing protocols 
        on the same router/switch where the IP forwarding table (FIB) 
        can be shared among all the IP routing protocols. 
     2. OSPF is capable of exchanging IP reachability information with 
        any other IP routing protocols. The most common scenario is the 
        reachability information exchange between OSPF and BGP-4. 
   The NNI routing protocol, if not OSPF, needs to have the capability 
   of interworking with OSPF and IS-IS where the minimum requirement is 
   the exchange of reachability information, although the exchange of 
   topology and resource information are also highly desired.

5.2 IS-IS and Integrated IS-IS 
   IS-IS was originally developed at Digital as Decnet Phase V 
 
   IS-IS is a link state routing protocol originally specified to route 
   OSI CNLS packets between Intermediate Systems (ISO’s description for 
   routers).  The specification for the protocol can be found in ISO 
   document 10589. 
    
   RFC 1195 defines Integrated IS-IS, an adaptation of this protocol 
   capable of routing both IP and OSI packets.

5.2.2   Neighbor/Adjacency Discovery 
   Neighboring routers are discovered through the periodic transmission 
   and reception of IS-IS Hello packets.  The hello packet provides the 
   neighbor with the router’s network layer address and a holding time.  
   The holding time is the number of seconds that the neighbor should 
   maintain reachability to the sending router without receiving 
   further IS-IS Hello packets.  The Hold timer is set so that even if 
   some Hello packets are dropped, the neighbor connection remains 
   active.  One version of the IS-IS Hello packet is used for point to 
   point links, the other is used for the LAN version, this contains 
   additional information such as the ID of other routers to ensure 
   that connectivity between neighbors is bi-directional. 
 
 
5.2.3   Addressing & Reachability 
   Integrated IS-IS supports NSAP, IPv4 and IPv6addressing. In IS-IS 
   routing, the network is partitioned into routing ‘domains’ 
   (equivalent to AS in OSPF). Routing domain boundaries are defined by 
   network management setting some links to be ‘exterior links’.  If a 
   link is marked as ‘exterior’, no IS-IS routing messages are sent on 
   that link. 
 
 

5.2.3.1 CLNP/NSAP addressing and routing 
   SDH/SONET, DECnet Phase V, ATM and cellular digital packet data use 
   CLNP Addressing, sometimes known as NSAP addressing. Routing 
   boundaries between routers in an area, areas in a domain and between 
   domains are determined by sections of the NSAP address. A ‘router’ 
   is any entity that routes CLNP packets on the basis of their layer 3 
   addresses, therefore a router in this context can be a dedicated 
   CLNP router or a controller card in a SONET ADM. 
 
   ISO 10589 specifies that up to three areas addresses may be 
   configured within an area. A number of implementations allow more 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 34] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   than that. In order for two neighboring level one routers to be in 
   the same area any one of the area addresses must match any one of 
   the areas in a received packet. 
   The NSAP address contains an area section and an ID section; for 
   routers to be within the same area, the area portion of their NSAP 
   address must to be identical.  Level 1 routes on the basis of the ID 
   field, there is no hierarchy in the ID portion of the address.  The 
   ID field is assumed to be a flat address space with no topological 
   significance.  Level 2 routes according to the longest prefix of the 
   area portion of the address.  Level 2 routing is similar to IP 
   routing. 
    
   In order to support end OSI end systems, a router must run the ES-IS 
   protocol. This is not the same as IS-IS. 
   OSI IS-IS routing makes use of a two-level hierarchical routing.  
   Level 1 routers know the topology in their area, including all the 
   routers and end systems in their area.  However the level 1 routers 
   do not know the identity of routers outside their area.  Level 1 
   routers forward all traffic outside their area to a level 2 router 
   in their area.  Level 2 routers do not need to know the topology 
   within any level 1 area, except that in some cases a level 2 router 
   may also be a level 1 router. 
 

5.2.3.2 IP addressing and routing 
   Level 1 routers within an area exchange LSPs that identify the IP 
   addresses that are reachable by each router. Specifically zero or 
   more [IP address, subnet mask, metric] combinations may be included 
   in each LSP.  A level 1 router routes as follows: 
     1. If a specified destination address matches an [IP address, 
        subnet mask, metric] reachable within the area, the packet is 
        routed using level 1 routing. 
     2. If a specified destination address does not match any [IP 
        address, subnet mask, metric] combination listed as reachable 
        within the area, the packet is routed towards the nearest 
        level2 router. Provided that the level two router is attached 
        to another area, otherwise this does not hold. 
 
   Level 2 routers include in their level 2 LSPs a complete list of [IP 
   address, subnet mask, metric] specifying all IP addresses reachable 
   in their area.  This information may be obtained from a combination 
   of the level 1 LSPs (obtained from level 1 routers in the same 
   area), and/or by manual configuration. In addition, level 2 routers 
   may report external reachability information, corresponding to 
   addresses thatcan be reached via routers in other routing domains.

   Some implementations allow this with level one LSPs as well as level 
   two. If supported the option is configurable. 
 
5.2.4   Topology Discovery & Dissemination 
   Topology discovery and dissemination is achieved by means of LSPs, 
   Link State PDUs. Each router constructs a packet known as a link 
   state packet or LSP (OSPF uses the term Link State Advertisements or 
   LSAs) which contains a list of reachable address prefixes, areas and 
   routers.  An IS-IS router will generate a LSP periodically or when 
   it has a new neighbor, the cost of the link to an existing neighbor 
   has changed or if the link to a neighbor has gone down.  The LSP is 
   then transmitted to all other routers. Each router stores 
   information gained from the most recently generated LSP from the 
   other routers.  The LSPs provide each router with a complete map of 
   topology.  LSPs are only exchanged between routers of their own type 
   (i.e. level 1 or level2), though as stated earlier, some routers can 
   operate as level 1 and 2 routers. 
 
   Based on the topological information obtained from LSPs, each router 
   can use SPF to calculate the optimal (least cost) path to a 
   destination.  However whilst an optimal route can be chosen within 
   an area, the extent to which an optimized path is chosen between 
   areas is dependent on the level of summarization used for address 
   prefixes in level 2 routing tables.  As with OSPF, there is a 
   balance between reduced table entries (to minimize router memory 
   usage)and an optimum path route. 
 
5.2.5   Resources 
   Work is currently being undertaken at the IETF to add extensions to 
   Integrated IS-IS LSPs to provide the ability for IS-IS to advertise 
   traffic engineering parameters, in parallel to similar efforts for 
   OSPF. 
   A set of parameters taken from the draft-ietf-isis-gmpls-extensions-
   04.txt Internet Draft, includes the following: 
 
     1. Maximum link bandwidth 
     2. Reservable link bandwidth 
     3. Unreserved bandwidth 
     4. TE Default metric 
     5. Link Protection Type 
     6. Interface Switching CapabilityDescriptor 
 
   There are many other extensions being proposed in particular those 
   in support of circuit provisioning of SDH, SONET and G.709 
   equipment.

5.2.6   Interface types and network Medium Support 
   Whilst Integrated IS-IS can route both CNLP and IP packets, the 
   routing protocol itself is based on CNLP.  This requires that all 
   infrastructure used in an IS-IS routing domain be able pass IS-
   IS/CNLP packets.  In practice CNLP can be carried on a variety of 
   data-link layer technologies such as Ethernet (all types), Token 
   Ring, FDDI, and Frame Relay. Also POS in which case OSICP is used. 
 
5.2.7   General Protocol Properties 
   This section briefly discusses the general protocol properties of 
   Integrated IS-IS. 
 

5.2.7.1 System Overhead 
   The amount of system overhead (memory and processing)required for 
   Integrated IS-IS or IS-IS routing is dependent on the following: 
 
   -Whether the router participates in both level 1 and level 2 
   routing– a level 1/ level 2router will need to maintain a detailed 
   database for its own area and a summarized database for all other 
   areas. 
    
   -The number of nodes within each IS-IS area. 
    
   -The total number of reachable addresses in every IS-IS area-thus 
   affecting the size of level 2 routing tables. 
    
   -The level of address summarization used in level 2 routing. As 
   mentioned before, this summarization is done at the expense of 
   calculating optimal path routes. 
    
   -The amount of the traffic engineering information disseminated 
   within an IS-IS area.  GMPLS provides for the dissemination of 
   resource information using IS-IS extensions.  Such information will 
   typically include available ports, timeslots (SONET) and wavelengths 
   (Optical layer equipment).  The level churn of connections will have 
   a serious impact on the amount of system overhead required to 
   process such IS-IS information particularly if such information is 
   to be processed in ‘real-time’. Such concerns are equally applicable 
   to OSPF extensions. 

5.2.7.2 Network Resource Overhead 
   IS-IS routing messages can either be carried in-band, out-band or 
   out-of-fiber. From the perspective of Transport network elements 
   under consideration in the OIF, in-band could mean the DCC bytes 
   available within SONET and SDH overheads. This is currently how 
   standards-based SDH and SONET configuration messages and alarms are 
  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 37] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   routed between network elements and their respective element 
   managers.  Out-band routing messages could be carried on a 
   supervisory wavelength, whilst out-of-fiber routing messages could 
   be carried out on a physically independent network such as an 
   Ethernet network. 
    
   Where out-of-fiber networks are used to transport routing messages, 
   such networks often rely on routers to route packets end-to-end.  
   Unless a different routing instance or static routing is used, the 
   topology information that is shared will include both the topology 
   of the transport network and the ‘out-of –band’ network. This has an 
   impact on the amount of routing information that passes through 
   transport network elements where both in-band and out-of-band 
   resources are used.   
    
   In-band channels such as SDH/SONET DCC channels represent ‘free’ 
   resource, however such resources are scarce(192kbps and 576kbps for 
   Section and Line DCC) and it is important to ensure that unnecessary 
   consumption is avoided at all costs. 
    
   Consumption of the network resources depend on factors including the 
   following: 
 
   -The amount of the routing messages that need to be put on the wire 
   depends on factors that similar to those listed above (Section 
   2.2.7.1). 
    
    
   -IS-IS LSPs containing traffic engineering parameters are likely 
   consume a large amount of bandwidth.  Work needs to be done to 
   quantify this.  However whilst IS-IS is an improvement over OSPF, in 
   that a single LSP can contain multiple reachable addresses, it is 
   the total bandwidth that matters. The total amount of information 
   carried in all the LSPs, LSP count in itself is not informative. I’m 
   not sure that I would say that IS-IS represents an improvement over 
   OSPF here. IS-IS is limited in that a single logical LSP can at most 
   be composed of 256 physical LSPs, each constrained to the local MTU. 
   This limitation makes it impossible for IS-IS to carry the number of 
   routes that OSPF can support. Furthermore, on a LAN, the DR in IS-IS 
   will be sending out a Complete Sequence Number Packet (CSNP) every 
   second or so. Actually this CSNP may well require multiple CSNPs if 
   there are a large number of LSPs in its database. So OSPF is more 
   efficient in terms of its use of bandwidth on the wire. However that 
   efficiency comes at a price. OSPF is a more complex protocol.

5.2.7.3 Reliability 
   IS-IS in a similar manner to OSPF does not have re-start capability, 
   other than re-build its routing database from scratch upon re-start. 
   This fact cannot be accepted by most of the carrier-class networks 
   today.  When after a significant failure within a network, a large 
   number of network elements are brought back ‘on-line’ the exchange 
   of LSPs could exceed the traffic limits of the network carrying the 
   LSPs.  Such congestion can be caused by insufficient link capacity 
   or intermediate router throughput capability. The result of such 
   congestion can be the prolonged time required to populate route 
   tables (through loss of LSPs), or even a complete failure to re-
   establish connectivity. 
   Such failures are inherent in all networks that use Link State 
   Routing Protocols, and work is being done in the IETF and ATM Forum 
   to modify IS-IS, OSPF and PNNI to ensure that the appropriate 
   mechanisms are in place to prevent such occurrences.  This will 
   ultimately have an impact on scalability. 
   IS-IS has already in place a mechanism to deal with router 
   congestion (OSPF has something similar as an option). When the IS-IS 
   routing database exceeds its allocated memory, a router that cannot 
   fit a new LSP into its database refuses to acknowledge the LSP.  The 
   neighbor continues trying to transmit the LSP.  A router that is 
   forced to refuse an LSP sets a flag in its LSP indicating that its 
   LSP database is full.  Other routers use paths through that router 
   only if no path through non-overloaded routers exits.  This behavior 
   means that a temporary overload situation heals itself without human 
   intervention. 
5.2.8   Scaling Capability 
   Scaling issues have already been addressed in other parts of this 
   document.  The scaling capability of IS-IS is no different to OSPF, 
   except in one regard: See my comment above. OSPF can carry more 
   routes than ISIS. 
 
   The large address space and hierarchical structure of the NSAP 
   format often used by IS-IS routers (20 bytes versus 4 bytes forIPv4) 
   allows the creation of worldwide networks without the need for 
   address translation or private addressing. 
 
5.2.9   Interworking Capability 
   Integrated IS-IS can route between network elements regardless of 
   whether IP or NSAP addressing is used.  Where it becomes necessary 
   to connect IP network elements to NSAP based network elements, 
   Integrated IS-IS provides an easy way of doing so.  Information can 
   be learnt from other Interior Gateway Protocols such as RIP and OSPF 
   (sometimes known as route redistribution).Interworking with inter 
   domain routing protocols is described in the next section.

5.2.10  Inter Domain Routing Protocols 
   Inter domain routing protocol information (IRPI) is included in 
   level 2 LSPs and serves to provide information only to inter domain 
   routing protocols. The IRPI field allows interdomain routers to find 
   each other.  The interdomain routers within a routing domain could 
   discover which of the level 2 routers within the domain could 
   discover which of the level 2 routers within the domain were also 
   interdomain routers. 
    
   Integrated IS-IS allows IP addresses reachable via inter-domain 
   routing to be reported in level 2 LSPs in the ‘IP external 
   reachability information’ field.  This includes routes learned from 
   OSPF, RIP or any other external routing protocol.

5.3 BGP 
   From RFC1771: 
   "The primary function of a BGP speaking system is to exchange 
   network reachability information with other BGP systems.  This 
   network reachability information includes information on the list of 
   Autonomous Systems (ASs) that reachability information traverses. 
   This information is sufficient to construct a graph of AS 
   connectivity from which routing loops may be pruned and some policy 
   decisions at the AS level may be enforced."

   Autonomous System 
   BGP Speaker 
   External Peer 
   Internal Peer 
   NLRI                 Network layer reachability information 
5.3.2   Neighbor/Adjacency Discovery 
   BGP does not include a neighbor discovery protocol.  In fact BGP 
   uses the term peer since communication is not always limited to 
   directly attached neighbors. All peers must be configured.  As an 
   inter-domain protocol this makes sense, since you do not necessarily 
   want any two boxes that get connected together in differing domains

   to start exchanging routing information.  Two types of  peers are 
   distinguished in BGP.  An external peer is a BGP speaker in a 
   different AS, while an internal peer is a BGP speaker within the 
   same AS. There is however a working assumption that external peers 
   are "directly connected" however this is not strictly required. 
   Internal peers are frequently not directly connected. 
5.3.3   Addressing & Reachability 
   BGP works with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Much of BGP's strength lies 
   in its very general mechanisms for dealing with reachability 
   information.  In particular this information can be aggregated 
   (summarized), filtered on input, and filtered on output (for 
   controlled information dissemination). 
   BGP is "the" reachability protocol.  The Update message contains a 
   path (AS_PATH) that furnished at least one possible route to reach 
   the destinations summarized (via prefixes) in the Network Layer 
   Reachability Information (NRLI) field.  Note that the NEXT_HOP 
   attribute can be used in terms of the next optical hop (rather than 
   IP hop).  Hence as it stands BGP can be used for arbitrary optical 
   reachability. The BGP sessions are set up via the IPCC addresses (IP 
   routable) but the information exchanged pertains to the optical 
   network not the IP control channel network. 
   BGP-4 [BGP1] provides a number of policy mechanisms that relate to 
   how routing information is used and disseminated. In particular the 
   E-BGP border router model keeps distinct the routing information 
   received from each of a border routers autonomous systems external 
   peers (Adj-RIBs-In -- Adjacent Routing Information Base In), the 
   routing information that the Autonomous System (AS) itself is using 
   (Loc-RIB -- Local Routing Information Base), and the routing 
   information that the AS forwards onto its external peers (Adj-RIBs-
   Out -- Adjacent Routing Information Base Out).  Via this model one 
   can develop policies with regards to which routes get chosen for use 
   in the AS, i.e., which routes from the Adj-RIBs-In are chosen to 
   populate the Loc-RIB. One also develops policies concerning what 
   routing information gets advertised to external peers, i.e., which 
   routes from Loc-RIB gets exported to each of the Adj-RIBs-Out. 
   The choice of which routes get imported for local routes generally 
   is concerned with the "quality" of those advertising the routes 
   since not too much else is known (besides the AS path vector). In 
   deciding which routes to advertise to external peers "transit 
   policies", i.e., whose traffic is allowed to transit this AS is the 
   prime consideration.  
   In the MPLS and in particular the explicitly routed optical case we 
   have a very strong additional policy mechanism, that of connection 
   admission control (CAC). Although an optical AS probably shouldn’t 
   advertise transit capabilities that it doesn’t wish to support, CAC 
   during connection establishment will be the final arbiter of any 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 41] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   transit policy.  In addition, some areas that are being addressed by 
   policies in the IP datagram case such as load balancing are much 
   easier to implement via CAC and/or explicit routing.  
 
5.3.4   Topology Discovery & Dissemination 
   BGP is a path vector type of protocol which can be thought of as a 
   variant of a vector distance protocol.  For each set of NLRI a path 
   vector is kept to indicate the sequence (or collection) of 
   autonomous systems that are traverse to reached these summarized 
   destinations.  The main reason for keeping this information is to 
   avoid routing loops.  Although the path vector information can give 
   us some notion of AS connectivity this is by necessity extremely 
   limited.  As part of the BGP route selection process only one route 
   to a set of destinations can be selected and only routes that are 
   actually used can be advertised via BGP to other ASs. 
5.3.5   Scaling Capabilities 
   BGP-4 was originally defined as an inter-domain routing protocol for 
   traditional IP networks where a common scenario was the BGP-4 would 
   be used as point-to-point communication protocol between ASBR that 
   is not very large in number in the IP networks. When the BGP-4 is 
   used in other scenario where the situation does not hold, as for 
   example when BGP-4 is used in a BGP/MPLS based VPN network, there 
   appears to be a serious scaling problem, i.e., there tends to be a 
   large number of end-to-end BGP-4 sessions in a network.  
    
   There exists mechanism to resolve the scalability problem using BGP 
   reflectors ([BGP4]). However, BGP reflector uses a server-client 
   model that creates a single-point-failure problem. 
5.3.6   Interworking Capability 
   BGP there exist several implementations where BGP interoperates with  
   popular IGPs (Interior Gateway Protocols) such as OSPF and IS-IS.

   the ATM Forum and is used for ATM networks. PNNI routing protocol is 
   link state algorithm based and in fact many elements are similar to 
   other routing protocols such as OSPF for IP networks and IS-IS for 
   OSI networks. PNNI routing protocol is capable of scaling to very 
   large networks through its hierarchical architecture. The addressing 
   used by PNNI routing protocol is called ATM End System Address, or 
   AESA, that is similar to the NSAP addressing. 
    
   The companion signaling protocol used in PNNI network is the PNNI 
   signaling protocol that is similar to the UNI4.0 signaling protocol 
   but with symmetric interface, among other differences. PNNI 
   signaling protocol is also defined by the ATM Forum and actually 
   contained in the same specification as the PNNI routing protocol.

   specifies the relationship between two PNNI neighboring peer nodes 
   or peer groups. A PNNI link can be one of the three as follows: 
   1.   A physical link that inter-connects two ATM switches. 
   2.   A VPC-based PNNI logical link. 
   3.   A SVCC-based PNNI logical link. 
   Note in PNNI networks, all inter-connections between PNNI nodes are 
   point-to-point. All PNNI routing messages are exchanged between PNNI 
   neighbors. PNNI routing messages are carried on the Routing Control 
   Channel (RCC) that is out-of-band but always in the same fiber where 
   the data channels reside. Note that the definition of "out of band" 
   in the packet switching case is a bit different then in circuit 
   switching case. 
   A Hello protocol is used to monitor the bi-directional communication 
   status between a pair of PNNI nodes, determines if the two neighbors 
   belong to the same peer group or not, etc. If the two neighbors 
   belong to the same peer group, the link is called Inside Link 
   otherwise Outside Link.  
   PNNI neighbors on an Inside Link will also exchange PNNI topology 
   information in packets called PNNI Topology State Element (PTSE). 
   PTSE carries the topology information including nodes, links, 
   addresses, and resources, etc. within that peer group. The operation 
   model of a PNNI peer group is similar to that of an OSPF area 
   wherein all routing information within that peer group is known to 
   all the nodes in that peer group. In addition, a peer group elects 
   one single node as the Peer Group Leader node. A separate PNNI node 
   instance at the higher hierarchical level may run on the same ATM 
   switch platform as the PGL of the lower hierarchical level resides. 
   The PNNI node instance at higher levels is called Logical Group Node 
   (LGN). The LGN then forms a neighbor relationship with any other LGN 
   in other peer groups on a SVCC-based RCC that allows routing 
   messages including Hello exchanged between the two LGNs on that RCC. 
   This scenario is recursive in nature. 
   PNNI neighbors on an Outside Link will also exchange hierarchical 
   information if available, including the identity of the higher level 
   PNNI nodes, peer groups, etc. PNNI nodes with Outside Links are 
   called Border Nodes. 
   One obvious similarity between ATM networks and optical networks is 
   the circuit-based interconnection. The other similarity is that both 
   networks dedicated to a single underlined networking technology, 
   i.e., ATM and optics, respectively. The similarity may be useful for 
   us to realize that as one part of the networking mechanism - the 
   routing protocol is also possible to share much similarity. 
   Note however "optics" is actually quite varied but it we want to 
   separate out technology specific routing information from more 
   general information.  What is similar across all the optical 
   technologies that we will be dealing with is that they are circuit

   oriented.  This tends to make bandwidth accounting/allocation quite 
   simple hence we spend almost no time worrying about it (except for 
   compact representations on the wire) while ATM spent a lot of time 
   on packet QoS issues.Technology-specific routing information (such 
   as regeneration requirements in “all-optical”  networks may create 
   essentially different QoS issues ) 
5.4.3   Addressing & Reachability 
   PNNI is an interior routing protocol used for ATM networks. The 
   addresses used in PNNI networks are ATM End System Address (AESA). 
   The AESA is 20-byte in length. The common portion of several AESAs, 
   consisted of the most significant bit stream of these AESA is called 
   ATM address prefix. The ATM address prefix is used to summarize 
   AESAs and other address prefixes.   
   An AESA is associated with an ATM host. In PNNI network, each PNNI 
   node has a unique AESA in the associated routing domain. Other ATM 
   devices register their AESAs with their attached ATM switches via 
   the ILMI protocol ([2]), and these AESAs are then advertised by the 
   associated PNNI node at the lowest hierarchy on that ATM switch 
   throughout the associated PNNI peer group along with the identity of 
   the advertising node itself. The advertised AESAs are therefore 
   reachable by other nodes in the same peer group.  
   The AESAs that registered with a PNNI node may be summarized if 
   possible and in this case, only the ATM address prefix is 
   advertised. This is one addressing scaling mechanism in the PNNI 
   networks. 
   All the AESAs and ATM address prefixes belong to a single PNNI peer 
   group are stored on each node in that peer group. The PGL in that 
   peer group may summarize these AESAs and address prefixes, then 
   deliver them to the LGN at the next higher hierarchical level and 
   advertise them to the LGN’s peer nodes and peer groups, such that 
   these AESAs and address prefixes are reachable from other peer 
   groups. Note the PGL and LGN perform a special role here as passing 
   address reachability information along the PNNI hierarchical levels, 
   but the actual data communication between peer groups is via the 
   border nodes. 
   Currently there does not exist any ATM inter-domain routing protocol 
   and as such, reachability for AESAs and address prefixes can only 
   possible via static configuration.  
   ATM address follows the same format of NSAP in the sense of 20-byte 
   in length, although there are different encoding rules for ATM 
   addresses (NSAP format, DCD format, etc.). PNNI routing protocol 
   itself does not have the ability to carry IP address but there 
   exists a “PNNI Augmented Routing”  (PAR), also defined by the ATM 
   Forum, is capable to do so. But I don’t think any vendor implemented 
   it yet. PAR was expected to be implemented on ATM switch and edge IP

   router so in the ATM core, it runs PNNI for ATM networks but 
   interface with IP routers for IP routing. 
5.4.4   Topology Discovery & Dissemination 
   The routing information is contained in the PNNI Topology State 
   Element (PTSE) that includes three categories as follows: 
   1.   Reachability of AESA and ATM address prefixes  (discussed in 
        the Section 2.4.3) 
   2.   Traffic parameters as called resource available information 
        (discussed in the Section 2.4.5) 
   3.   Network topology including PNNI nodes, links, their 
        connectivity and hierarchy (discussed in this section) 
   The nodes and links within a single PNNI peer group are advertised 
   throughout that peer group. Note this behavior is the same for all 
   the peer groups - at each of the hierarchical levels. As similar to 
   the OSPF area, routing path within a single PNNI peer group can be 
   made very optimized  Within a single peer group, the detail topology 
   information including nodes, links and addresses along with 
   resources information are known by all nodes, so the constraint-
   based routing can take such advantage to make the routing path very 
   optimized. Note the routing messages are only exchanged on Inside 
   Links. 
   There are two types of PNNI nodes, i.e., the LGN/PGL nodes and the 
   border nodes, the LGN/PGL need to perform additional duties as 
   described as follows. 
   Each LGN at higher level hierarchy needs to pass the topology 
   information down to the PNNI node at the next lower hierarchy, i.e., 
   the PGL of the peer group at that lower level. The PGL then 
   advertises that information throughout its peer group. This behavior 
   is recursive in nature. 
   Each PNNI border node while performing Hello with its neighbors 
   belong to other peer groups and in addition, it exchanges the 
   identity of its ancestor nodes, i.e., LGNs and peer groups at higher 
   hierarchies with its peers. The obtained information is advertised 
   via a so-called Uplink PTSE throughout the border node’s own peer 
   group. The PGL in that peer group will then pass the information 
   contained in the Uplink to one or more of the LGNs at its higher 
   level hierarchies. The information contained in the Uplink will be 
   used to identify the neighboring LGN, if identified, a PNNI logical 
   link will be established between the two LGNs at that higher 
   hierarchical level. Note while the logical link is one-hop away, it 
   is based on SVCC-based RCC such that physically it may contain 
   multiple physical hops. A logical link logically inter-connects two 
   adjacent peer groups, and it is advertised within the associated 
   peer group at the higher level hierarchy as well as passes down to 
   the peer groups below that hierarchy, so that PNNI nodes at lower 


  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 47] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   level hierarchies understand the connectivity with other peer groups 
   also. This behavior is also recursive in nature. 
   As described above collectively, the topology information of a 
   single peer group is always exactly known by all nodes in that peer 
   group, but the topology information of other peer groups is not 
   known except the inter-connectivity between peer groups. 
   Therefore, routing path within a single peer group is possibly made 
   very optimized, but not across peer group boundaries. I'm not sure 
   that this is that bad, at least one gets to see how the peer groups 
   are connected and choose from there.  This is much better than not 
   having that visibility.  But of course not as optimal as complete 
   information.   
5.4.5   Resources 
   ATM is well known for its QoS and traffic management capability, and 
   the PNNI routing protocol is also capable of advertising various of 
   traffic engineering parameters, as so-called Resource Availability 
   information. 
   The Resource Available information is contained in the following 
   PTSEs: 
 
   1.   Reachable address PTSE 
   2.   Horizontal links PTSE – advertisements for PNNI Inside Links 
        and logical links 
   3.   Uplinks PTSE 
    
   The set of traffic parameters currently advertised by PNNI routing 
   protocol is service category based and directional based, and as 
   follows: 
   1.   Maximum cell rate (MaxCR) 
   2.   Available cell rate  (AvCR) 
   3.   Administrative weight (AW)  
   4.   Cell transfer delay (CTD) 
   5.   Cell delay variation (CDV)  
   6.   Cell loss ratio for CLP0 (CLR0) 
   7.   Cell loss ratio for CLP0+1 (CLR0+1) 
   8.   Cell rate margin (CRM) 
   9.   Variance factor (VF) 
   It is interesting to see the set of traffic parameters is very 
   focused on ATM technology only, although the PNNI routing protocol 
   uses the link state algorithm that is also used by other non-ATM 
   routing protocols. Perhaps this is a good example for us to 
   speculate that a routing protocol that uses IP addressing, link-
   state based but focus on optical networks may also be built easily 
   from scratch, with much more cleaner background, and more reflective 
   and interactive with the underlined technology.

5.4.6   General Protocol Properties 
   This section briefly discusses the general protocol properties of 
   the PNNI in the specific areas as in the following sections. 

5.4.6.1 System Overhead 
   The memory required to support PNNI operation is a variable 
   depending on several factors including the following: 
 
   1.   Whether the node is a PGL or not, and if is, how many 
        hierarchical levels above – for a PGL node in a given peer 
        group, there would be a separate PNNI node instance (LGN) 
        operating on the same ATM switch platform. This scenario is 
        also recursive in nature. Additional PNNI nodes in the same 
        hardware platform will consume more memory and CPU resources. 
    
   2.   Whether the node is a border node or not – border node may also 
        consume more memory and CPU resources since it needs to 
        generate and maintain Uplinks among other things. 
    
   3.   The number of nodes and links within each PNNI peer group. 
    
   4.   The number of reachable addresses within a single PNNI peer 
        group as well as advertised from other peer groups. 
    
   5.   The amount of the traffic engineering information within a PNNI 
        peer group.  
    
   6.   The total number of hierarchical levels. 
   Most of the PNNI routing messages are re-transmittable driven by the 
   associated timers in the order of seconds or milli-seconds and the 
   timer values are configurable.  

5.4.6.2 Network Resource Overhead 
   PNNI routing messages can either be carried in-band, out-band but 
   always in-fiber as deployed as in today’s ATM networks. The 
   consumption of the network resources depend on factors including the 
   following: 
   1.   The amount of the routing messages that need to be put on the 
        wire - depends on factors that similar to those listed above 
        for the memory consumption. 
    
   2.   The amount of the Resource Availability information for the 
        advertising. The code point for carrying Resource Availability 
        is defined in such a way where if more than one service 
        category with the same set of Resource Availability 
        information, a compact format can be used. E.g., if the set of 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 49] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
        traffic parameters for CBR and rt-VBR on a link is the same, 
        there requires only one data block as defined by the code point 
        for both services, with a one-bit flag set for the indication. 
        In order to reduce network resource overhead, updates of 
        resource availability in PNNI is controlled by timers and 
        thresholds (defining “significant change” of a resource). 
        Optical network lack cell-specific resources described in 
        2.4.5., which should reduce the amount of advertised traffic.  
    
   3.   The amount of the reachable addresses and address prefixes for 
        the advertising. If there exists a large number of reachable 
        addresses or address prefixes, they might be summarized before 
        the advertising. Note PNNI provides configurable summary 
        address that can be used for the address summarization. 
   PNNI routing protocol defines bandwidth and service category that 
   used for routing messages on RCCs. Default values are recommended 
   and also both are configurable as defined in the PNNI routing MIB. 
   This is a very good feature that needs to be taken into account for 
   the routing protocol used in the optical networks. One of the 
   reasons is that control channel used to carry routing messages in 
   the optical networks may be in-band, out-band or out-of-fiber, and 
   as such, the bandwidth consumption and perhaps other QoS 
   requirements for the routing messages might need to be estimated and 
   defined for reference. 

5.4.6.3 Reliability 
   PNNI does not have re-start capability originally other than re-
   build its routing database from scratch upon re-start. This fact 
   cannot be accepted by most of the carrier-class networks today, and 
   as a result, vendors will most likely to implement their own schemes 
   to support high reliability requirements. But the routing is not 
   service impacting unlike the call processing. 
    
5.4.7   Scaling Capability 
   PNNI routing protocol is capable of scaling and can handle very 
   large ATM networks with the following characteristics: 
        -The scalability of PNNI routing protocol is the most comparing 
        to any other existing routing protocols due to its hierarchical 
        architecture. PNNI networks can scale up to 104 hierarchical 
        levels and at each level, there may be multiple peer groups. 
        Each PNNI peer group has up to from several 10s to several 
        hundred nodes in reality today. 
    
        -Like other routing protocols, PNNI achieves scaling capability 
        by partitioning networks into segments (peer groups in PNNI 
        case) and restrict the information flow across segment 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 50] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
        boundary. The amount of the flow that floods into foreign PNNI 
        peer groups is controllable using protocol mechanism along with 
        configurable parameters. 
    
        -PNNI routing protocol is the only one as today can achieve 
        link state algorithm based routing both at the lowest level 
        hierarchy as well as all the higher level hierarchies. This 
        feature helps the effective routing across peer group 
        boundaries. Note link state algorithm based routing only exists 
        at the lowest level for both OSPF and IS-IS, not beyond. 
   The highlights of PNNI routing protocol’s scaling mechanism are as 
   follows:  
   1.   Address summarization – as described in the Section 2.4.3, PNNI 
        is capable of performing address summarization at each node of 
        each hierarchical level. 
    
   2.   Link aggregation – this is a similar feature as the link 
        bundling defined in the GMPLS but with much elegant 
        infrastructure. A set of horizontal links between two PNNI LGNs 
        may be aggregated into  any smaller number of links by 
        configuration so-called Aggregation Token on the Outside Links 
        at the lowest hierarchical level. Upon aggregation, the amount 
        of Resource Availability information is also aggregated and 
        reduced. 
    
   3.   Nodal aggregation – this is a unique feature that no other 
        routing protocol possesses as today. A PNNI peer group is 
        represented by a LGN at the next higher hierarchical level and 
        as a default, the topology information inside the child peer 
        group is totally hidden from other peer group, exactly the same 
        scenario as that in an OSPF area. Therefore, the routing path 
        across PNNI peer group boundary has to be blindly by default 
        sent to one of the Exit Border node of the child peer group, 
        resulting the inefficient or sub-optimized routing paths. A LGN 
        that does not advertise any topology information for its child 
        peer group is called Simple Node Representation.Such a feature 
        properly extended could come in handy in the optical arena.  
        For example, the representations of a optical ring would be 
        quite simple (and this is a very popular optical subnetwork.. 
    
   Optionally, a PNNI LGN can advertise some topology information for 
   the child peer group it represents, and such a LGN is called Complex 
   Node Representation. Usually a Complex node advertises a set of so-
   called Nodal State PTSEs where each of them describes the set of the 
   traffic parameters (aggregated) between a pair of border nodes in 
   the associated child peer group; the information can be used during 

  
 Bernstein, G.                                               [Page 51] 

                draft-ipo-optical-inter-domain-00.txt   November 2001 
 
 
   the route calculation when choosing path traversing that peer group. 
   The PNNI routing protocol does not specify the limit of those 
   advertisements and how the aggregation is accomplished and this 
   provides flexibility for vendors’ own implementation as well as 
   customers’ preferences based on applications. The Complex Node 
   Representation provides a powerful and flexible solution to a common 
   topology scaling problem such that the routing efficiency and 
   optimization may also be possible across peer groups. PNNI Complex 
   Node representation is a logical star network with several 
   “exceptions”. As pointed out in the previous paragrpaph, for optical 
   networks, a different Complex Node representation may be needed 
   (perhaps, a logical ring with several “exceptions”).  
   The routing protocol used for the optical networks certainly 
   requires address summarization capability. It also certainly 
   requires the link aggregation capability since parallel links are 
   very common in optical networks. The need for nodal aggregation will 
   depend on the prediction of the size of the optical networks, i.e., 
   it may not be needed the scope of a single PNNI peer group or a 
   single OSPF area can cover an entire given optical network. The 
   question is – is this a correct assumption? Nodal aggregation at the 
   peer group level may be useful for dealing with some types of 
   "generalized node" diverse paths.  But I'm not really sure, link 
   aggregation and the hierarchy stuff give us a lot already.

6  Conclusion 
    
   This draft highlighted some of the considerations for an inter-
   domain route protocol for use in optical internetworking.  The main  
   differences between optical routing and datagram routing were 
   highlighted.  Additional requirements to be addressed in an optical 
   inter-domain route protocol were discussed and several applications 
   of inter-domain routing were highlighted.  A summary of optical 
   sublayer specific routing information was furnished for both the 
   transparent optical sublayer and the SONET/SDH sublayer.  Finally a 
   review of the applicability of several existing route protocols to 
   the optical inter-domain route problem was given. 
    
7  Security Considerations

7.1.1    
 
   Protection of the routing information exchanged across an optical 
   inter-domain interface is of high importance; erroneous reachability 
   or topology information may result in connection provisioning 
   requests that either fail or are routed across sub-optimal paths. It 
   is also possible that failed requests may consume significant 
   control and transport resources for a transient amount of time. It 
   follows that erroneous routing information could result in degraded 
   carrier network operation, or even render a carrier’s network 
   inoperable. Security requirements are expected to be of higher 
   importance in interfaces between different administrative domains.  
   Therefore, an optical inter-domain routing protocol should provide 
   the following: 
    
  1. Authenticate entities with which routing information is exchanged. 
     For example, a carrier should authenticate the identity of other 
     carriers it is connected to. The specific mechanisms used for 
     authentication should provide protection against attacks; for 
     example they should not be based on simple clear-text password 
     authentication schemes. 
    
  2. Guarantee the integrity of routing information (topology, 
     reachability and resource status) exchanged across the interface. 
     This requirement can be satisfied using security mechanisms at 
     different layers. For example, each routing message could be 
     individually authenticated using a keyed message digest, which is 
     embedded in the message. Both OSPF and BGP provide such options. 
     Alternatively, the two parties could establish a security 
     association at the network layer using IPSEC, which could be used 
     to provide security services to the optical inter-domain routing 
     protocol. 
    
   From the point of view of routing, information integrity is likely 
   to be the most important requirement. However, in some cases it 
   might be necessary to provide confidentiality of the routing 
   information as well. A possible scenario for this is when a carrier 
   would like to advertise information privately to another carrier, 
   but does not wish to publicly disseminate this information, due to 
   policy constraints. 
    
   It should be noted than none of the known mechanisms that provide 
   information integrity (such as keyed digests or IPSEC) can provide 
   adequate protection against a compromised node participating in the 
   inter-domain routing protocol. This is an item for further study.
