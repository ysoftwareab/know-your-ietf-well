Abstract

   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 provides a mechanism for a
   service to be discovered in a single exchange of messages.  This
   exchange of messages does not presently include any of the service's
   attributes.  This document specifies a SLPv2 extension which allows
   a User Agent to request a service's attributes be included as an
   extension to Service Reply messages.  This will eliminate the need
   for multiple round trip messages for a UA to acquire all service
   information.

1. Introduction

   The Service Location Protocol, Version 2 [3] provides a mechanism for
   a service to be discovered in a single exchange of messages.  The UA
   sends a Service Request message and the DA or SA (as appropriate)
   sends a Service Reply message.

   It is clearly advantageous to be able to obtain all service
   information at once.  The Service Location Protocol separates
   messages which obtain different classes of information.  This
   extension enables an optimization to the basic exchange of messages,
   which currently does not include service attributes in Service Reply
   messages.

   This document specifies a SLPv2 extension which allows a User Agent
   to request that a service's attributes be included in Service Reply
   messages.  This will eliminate the need for multiple round trip
   messages for a UA to acquire all service information.

   If the DA or SA does not support the SLPv2 extension, it will simply
   return a Service Reply.  Support of this extension is OPTIONAL.

Internet Draft     Attribute List Extension for SLPv2       October 2000


1.1. Terminology

      User Agent (UA)
                A process working on the user's behalf to establish
                contact with some service.  The UA retrieves service
                information from the Service Agents or Directory Agents.

      Service Agent (SA)
                A process working on the behalf of one or more services
                to advertise the services.

      Directory Agent (DA)
                A process which collects service advertisements.  There
                can only be one DA present per given host.

1.2. Notation Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119  [2].

2. Attribute List Extension

   The format of the Attribute List Extension is as follows:

      0                   1                   2                   3
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |      Extension ID = 0x0002    |     Next Extension Offset     |
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     | Offset, contd.|      Service URL Length       |  Service URL  /
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |     Attribute List Length     |         Attribute List        /
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |# of AttrAuths |(if present) Attribute Authentication Blocks.../
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The Extension ID is 0x0002.

   The Next Extension Offset value indicates the position of the next
   extension as offset from the beginning of the SLP message.  If the
   next extension offset value is 0, there are no more extensions in the
   message.

   A UA sends an Attribute List Extension with a Service Request.  The
   Service URL Length and Attribute List Length are set to 0 and the
   Service URL and Attribute List fields omitted in this case.  The UA
   thereby requests that the SA or DA include an Attribute List
   Extension in its Service Reply by including such an 'empty' Attribute
   List Extension in the Service Request.

Internet Draft     Attribute List Extension for SLPv2       October 2000


   A SA or DA which supports the Attribute List Extension returns one
   Attribute List extension for every URL Entry in the Service Reply
   message.  The order of the Attribute List Extensions SHOULD be the
   same as the URL Entries in the Service Reply.

   The Service URL [4] identifies the corresponding URL Entry.

   The Attribute List field is the entire attribute list of the service.
   These attributes must be in the same language as that indicated in
   the Service Request message.

   If the Service Request message includes a SLP SPI string, then the
   attribute list extension MUST include an authentication block.  If
   the SA or DA does not support or is unable to return an
   authentication block for the SLP SPI included in the Service Request,
   then the SA or DA MUST NOT return an Attribute List Extension.  The
   format of the Attribute List extension is exactly the same as would
   be included in an Attribute Reply or Service Registration message.


3. IANA Considerations

   According to RFC 2608:

         New SLP Extensions with types in the range 2-65535 may be
         registered following review by a Designated Expert [5].

   The extension ID number for the Attribute List Extension is 0x0002.
   This ID has been selected by the Designated Expert for SLPv2, and
   must be registered with IANA.

4. Internationalization Considerations

   The Service Location Protocol, version 2 has mechanisms for allowing
   attributes to be transmitted with explicit language tagging [6].  The
   same mechanisms are used for this protocol extension.


5. Security Considerations

   The Service Location Protocol, version 2 has mechanisms for allowing
   authenticators to be returned with attribute lists so that UAs are
   able to verify a digital signature over the attributes they obtain.
   This same mechanism is used for this protocol extension.  The
   Attribute List Extension used in conjunction with SLPv2 is no less
   secure than SLPv2 without the extension.
