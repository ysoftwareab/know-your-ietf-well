Abstract

   This document discusses the general problem of routing in an IPv6
   Nested Virtual Private Network.  A solution is proposed based on one-
   way hashes of IP Prefix values.  The concepts extend to IPv4, but
   with difficulty due to the number of bits in question.

1.  Introduction

   This document discusses the general problem of routing in an IPv6
   Nested Virtual Private Network.  A solution is proposed based on one-
   way hashes of IP Prefix values, or equivalently, the use of encrypted
   prefix values.  The concepts extend to IPv4, but with difficulty due
   to the number of bits available in the address.

                 Figure 1: Nested Virtual Private Network

   Figure 1 shows what the authors have described as a "Nested VPN".
   Like normal VPNs, this is a network that has a variety of enclaves
   that communicate across an encrypted cloud that is invisible to them



Baker, et al.           Expires January 18, 2006                [Page 5]

   (apart from effects such as delay or jitter) and to which they are
   invisible.  It differs in that the construct is recursive - such
   encrypted clouds may themselves appear to be enclaves to further
   underlying VPN networks - and that little or no information is
   permitted to cross the boundary and yet any enclave must be enabled
   to communicate with any other enclave at the same nesting level.

   Normal VPNs tend to be managed in one of two ways.  One is that a
   service provider offers the VPN, and provides an underlying circuit
   network, often MPLS, that connects the underlying endpoints as
   defined in a contract.  These are referred to as "Provider-
   Provisioned VPNs" [RFC3809].  The other, generally referred to as
   "customer-provisioned", is that the edge routers themselves provide
   tunnels over an underlying network using one of a variety of types of
   IP tunnel technologies loose source routes as specified in DVMRP
   [RFC1075], IP/IP [RFC2003], IPsec/ESP [RFC2401][RFC2406], L2TP
   [RFC2661], GRE [RFC2784], and others.

   In this context, a "Nested VPN" is an example of an IPsec or IPsec-
   like VPN, and is therefore "customer-provisioned".  Such networks
   have in the past been built in a very ad hoc fashion, without
   significant knowledge or concern for the underlying network
   infrastructure.  They have often consisted of either a haphazard
   collection of tunnels, or a star or multi-star network in which a
   large set of client sites maintain static or semi-static tunnels with
   a much smaller set of service sites.  Such networks support
   telecommuters working from home offices, small distributed companies,
   and so on.

1.2  Defining Terms

   Plain Text: A domain in which datagrams are sent without additional
      encryption.

   Cipher Text: A domain in which datagrams are sent with additional
      encryption.  Note that if there is an additional layer of
      encryption in the network beyond that provided by a given cipher
      text domain, a cipher text domain will be treated by that cipher
      text domain as if it were a plain text domain - traffic entering
      it will be encrypted, and traffic leaving it will be decrypted.

   Domain: In the context of this document, the routing domain of
      relevance.  This will be either a Cipher text or a Plain text
      domain.

Internet-Draft             Nested VPN Routing                  July 2005


   Enclave: A Plain text Domain, as seen from the Cipher text domain

   One Way Hash: One of a variety of approaches that scramble the bits
      in a string or number to produce a different one, and from which
      the original cannot be deduced.  Examples, include CRCs, MD5, etc.
      Encrypted addresses have also been suggested, and would work in
      this context, but require management of the ability to decrypt the
      address, via key management.

   VPN Router: A special case of a router supporting IPsec or IPsec-like
      tunnels over an IP network, and having the characteristic that
      information leakage between plain text and cipher text parts of
      the same router is absolutely minimal - ideally zero.


1.3  Fundamental Requirements for Routing

   [I-D.ietf-rpsec-routing-threats] describes in general terms the
   threats that one deals with in routing, and [I-D.ietf-rpsec-generic-
   requirements] describes general security requirements for routing.
   They might be summarized as relating to four basic attack vectors:
   authenticity of the channel, privacy of the channel (both of which
   might be adequately addressed by IPsec), correctness of the data, and
   scalability to the network design in question.  These issues apply to
   any routing solution.

   In addition, nested VPNs in this context require as close to zero
   information leakage as possible between domains.  Note that as a
   practical matter this is not quite "zero"; the only approach that has
   been suggested to date that truly leaks no information across domains
   (broadcast a request to all domains asking the right one to respond)
   has scalability issues in networks larger than a few tens or hundreds
   of enclaves.  All other known approaches require some level of
   sharing of knowledge between domains - the CPE router creates,
   whether through configuration or some more dynamic process, a tunnel
   to a router across the cipher text domain by connecting to a
   specified cipher text domain address.

1.4  Fundamental proposal: use of a one-way hash

   First, imagine that a VPN Router consists of two independent
   functional elements, whether physical or logical, and information
   crosses between them through a narrowly defined interconnection
   function.  These four functions are:

Internet-Draft             Nested VPN Routing                  July 2005


   Plain Text Router: A router that is entirely within the plaintext
      enclave network.

   Cipher Text Router: A router that is entirely within the ciphertext
      network.

   Encrypt/Decrypt Unit: A functional element (either an interface card
      or a separate device) with three interfaces:

      *  A local interface to the plaintext router, in which datagrams
         are passed as IP datagrams associated with a plaintext network
         next hop address.  Such datagrams are encrypted using IPsec
         ESP's [RFC2406] Tunnel Mode, and passed to the Cipher Text
         Router.

      *  An interface to the ciphertext router, which is or is
         functionally equivalent to a LAN interface.  Messages received
         on it are decrypted and handed to the Plain Text Router.

      *  A network management interface, which enables the programming
         of security associations in the encrypt/decrypt process.

   Network Manager A functional element (software or hardware) that is
      capable of programming security associations and passes narrowly
      defined communications between the plaintext and ciphertext
      routers.  These communciations might include configuration
      information and commands to generate or forward QoS signaling.

   Such a configuration is shown in Figure 2.

   The hash function accepts a number of 0 to 64 bits and hashes it

   according to an externally specific (e.g., not intrinsic to this
   specification) algorithm.  Possible algorithms include CRCs, SHA1,
   MD5 hashes, AES encryption, etc.

   Coupled with Stateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC2462] and
   specifically its Privacy extensions [RFC3041], this enables us to
   create a host part of an IPv6 address based on a randomized number
   taken from the enclave and build an address based on it unknown on
   the plain text side (either within the enclave or in any remote
   enclave) but in a certain sense predictable by it.

   Let us work through an example of unicast use.  Figure 4 shows a
   simple case of a VPN.  The fundamental problems are:

   o  Given a prefix on the LAN in the upper enclave, how does one form
      an address on the cipher text side of the VPN Router?

   o  How does the plain text prefix of the upper LAN or address of Host
      1 relate to routing?

   o  How does the corresponding cipher text prefix or address relate to
      routing?

   o  How does a host in a remote enclave determine the address of Host
      1?

   o  How does a host in a remote enclave direct a datagram to the
      appropriate VPN Router to get it to Host 1?

   o  Presuming that the two VPN Routers are unknown to each other, how
      do they form the appropriate security association?


2.1  Inner domain routing

   IPSec or IPSec like routers currently support static configuration of
   ciphertext addresses in security databases.  These addresses are used
   by the VPN router to initialize security associations to a set of
   well-known ciphertext addresses.  The mechanism to dynamically create
   and discover new or changing cipher text addresses as described in
   this document complements the static configuration mechanism or other
   legacy mechanisms (for example, directory servers could resolve
   ciphertext address queries).  Static configuration of a known set of
   ciphertext addresses on a VPN router is useful in setting up default
   security associations (for example to peer enterprise VPN routers or
   to enterprise headquarters).

   In the inner domain of Figure 1 , the authors consider it likely that
   security associations between VPN8 and VPN7 are likely to be
   statically configured, allowing IGP routing to run over them as
   through a tunnel.  This connects the routing of the interface
   domains, enabling the alogrithm described in Section 2.2 to work
   properly.

   In addition, other approaches exist to distribute routing information
   in the core.  For example, one could use Mobile IP to connect to a
   central "Home Agent" within the ciphertext domain which would be able
   to provide, through Optimized Routing, the address of the proper peer
   as a Care-of Address.  Having established that relationship, OSPF
   with the Do-Not-Age flag could allow the domains to exchange routing
   information but not have to maintain continuous routing relationships
   thereafter.  Another alternative would be a directory service similar
   to LDAP or DNS that could associate the hashed nonce with the
   ciphertext address located within the ciphertext domains.

2.2  Forming a ciphertext address from a plaintext prefix

   First, a VPN Router (as shown in Figure 2) is in every sense a
   router, as defined by the IPv6 Architecture [RFC2460], which defines
   a router as any "node that forwards IPv6 packets not explicitly
   addressed to itself. " As a router, it may advertise (using
   theStateless Address Autoconfiguration [RFC2462] Router
   Advertisement) a prefix into its plain text domain, or it may pick up
   similar advertisements from another router.  It and the other hosts
   in the enclave form addresses within the enclave's prefix as
   specified in that procedure, and may subsequently advertise these
   addresses in DNS in the plain text domain or disseminate them in
   other ways.

   As shown in Figure 5, knowing the prefix for the enclave LAN, the
   plain text side of the VPN Router hashes the prefix (the /64 or the
   appropriate subset of it) and communicates the hashed value to the
   cipher text side.  That interface is similarly engaged in stateless
   address autoconfiguration.  It uses the prefix from that side
   (whether configured or learned) with the hashed value to form an
   address for the cipher text side.

   There are two approaches to placing multiple LANs within an enclave.
   One is to have the VPN Router participate in routing within the
   enclave, and form multiple such addresses on the cipher text side.
   Another is to use a shorter prefix in each enclave, such as perhaps a
   /60.  A /60 would permit every enclave to support 16 IPv6 LANs
   without expanding routing.

   The cipher text-side address is now included in routing in the IP
   network on the cipher text side as a host route (/128), or may be
   distributed in an OSPF Opaque LSA (if the routing domain is entirely
   OSPF).

2.3  Routing between enclaves

   This system may obviously be used in two ways.  It may be used across
   a common ciphertext domain, or across mulpitple ciphertext domains
   that route traffic through intermediate enclaves.

2.3.1  Routing between enclaves across a common ciphertext domain

   Once the security association is set up between two VPN routers, the
   respective enclaves can exchange routing information in the security
   association.  As an example, if the two disjoint enclaves learn
   routes inside their respective enclaves via the use of an IGP
   protocol like OSPF, OSPF route advertisements can be exchanged in the
   security association which is set up using the procedure described
   above.  Hence hosts and routers within each enclave learn routes from
   the remote enclave using the same protocol that is used within their
   enclave via the invisible security association between the VPN
   routers.

2.3.2  Routing between enclaves across a multiple ciphertext domains

   By extension, if a router in an intermediate enclave establishes
   relationships with multiple plaintext peers, it has the option to
   advertise its capability as a transit path between them.  In this
   case, a network can be built across multiple plaintext domains.

Internet-Draft             Nested VPN Routing                  July 2005


2.4  Routing to a remote address

   Let us imagine that the two enclaves in Figure 4 have just performed
   the procedure in Section 2.2 and at this point have no active
   security association.  Host 4 is able to determine the address of
   Host 1 via DNS, and wishes to commune with it.

   Host 4 is essentially unaware of the network connecting it to Host 1,
   and unaware of the presence or absence of a VPN Router.  Like any
   IPv6 host, it encapsulates the datagram in an IPv6 datagram header
   and ships it to its friendly neighborhood plain text router, which
   happens to be a VPN Router in this case.  Processing in the VPN
   router is a little different, however:

   o  The plain router first determines the next hop address (via
      routing functions such as OSPF or BGP).

   o  It then determines whether there is an established security
      association from the Network Management process

   o  if not, it lets the Network Management process establish such an
      association (see [RFC2401]).

   o  It then presents either the next hop address or the SPI that has
      been associated with it, with the datagram, to the encrypt/decrypt
      unit.

   o  The encrypt/decrypt unit derives the appropriate remote cipher
      text address from the security association information stored in
      it.

   o  Having encrypted the datagram and appropriately re-encapsulated
      it, the encrypt/decrypt unit presents the cipher text datagram to
      the cipher text router.

   If at any point in this process the route lookup or the security
   association fails, the datagram is dropped.

   The receiving process follows standard IPsec tunnel-mode security
   procedures.  The cipher text router presents the datagram to the
   encrypt/decrypt unit, which decapsulates and decrypts it, and
   presents the resulting datagram to the plain text router.

2.5  Proving recursiveness

   The proof of recursiveness is simple.  Consider Figure 1 and presume
   that H1 wishes to exchange files with H6.




Baker, et al.           Expires January 18, 2006               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft             Nested VPN Routing                  July 2005


   When the networks come up, H1 derive its address from R1 and H6
   derives its address from R6.  VPN1's plain text side participates in
   the routing, and learns of the two LANs in the domain, or learns of
   the shorter prefix encompassing them if that is the case in this
   network.  It forms a cipher text-side address for each relevant
   prefix.  Similarly, VPN6 participates in the routing of its domain
   and forms relevant addresses.  So also the other peripheral enclaves.
   Routing to those host addresses is injected into the routing of
   interface domain 1 and interface domain 2.

   This is also true of interface domain 1 and interface domain 2.  VPN7
   and VPN8 see the interface domains as enclaves and the inner domain
   as a cipher text domain.  VPN7 and VPN8 form addresses in the inner
   domain from the prefixes used in the interface domains, and advertise
   corresponding host routes into the routing of the inner domain.

   So:

   o  Host H1 sends a datagram to H6, passing it to R1.

   o  R1 passes it along its default route, to VPN1.

   o  VPN1 finds that the next hop towards H6 is VPN6, either by
      inspection of the prefix or by knowledge from routing, and knows
      that this is across the cipher text domain.  It hashes the /64 of
      the datagram's source address and passes that to the cipher text
      side.  There is no corresponding security association, but VPN6's
      cipher text-side address shows up in routing, with R7 as the next
      hop.  VPN1 now opens a security association with VPN6, meaning
      that its cipher text side must send a datagram to VPN6.

   o  The SA-Open datagram is handed to R7, which hands it to VPN7.

   o  VPN7 finds that the next hop towards VPN6 is VPN8, either by
      inspection of the prefix or by knowledge from routing, and knows
      that this is across the inner cipher text domain.  It hashes the
      /64 of the datagram's source address and passes that to its cipher
      text side.  There is no corresponding security association, but
      VPN8's cipher text-side address shows up in routing, with R9 as
      the next hop.  VPN7 now opens a security association with VPN8,
      meaning that its cipher text side must send a datagram to VPN8.

   o  The IKE exchange happens between VPN7 and VPN8, and when the
      relationship is accepted, the datagram initiating the IKE exchange
      between VPN1 and VPN6 is encrypted and passed along.

   o  The IKE exchange happens between VPN1 and VPN6, and when the
      relationship is accepted, the datagram initiating the datagram

      from H1 to H6 is encrypted and passed along.


2.6  Open Issues (Author's notes to self)

   Anycast: Does this preclude anycast applications?

   Hash collisions: A good hash such as SHA should keep the collisions
      to a minimum, but theoretically they can still happen.

   Plaintext prefix collisions: If two enclaves chose the same prefix,
      this would result in two VPN gateways advertising the same
      address.  This is a configuration error (two enclaves shouldn't do
      that, not in an IP network)

   Ciphertext host part collisions: A VPN router properly forms its
      cipher text address, and finds that its address collides with the
      address of another device on its link.  The autoconfiguration
      process provides for arbitration, but the VPN router can't change
      its address.  Wouldn't that be a fatal problem?

3.  Multicast Routing Solution - SSM

   It has been aptly said that anyone who thinks he understands
   something in routing should repeat his statement using the word
   "multicast".  This section proposes to do exactly that.  Figure 4
   shows a simple case of a VPN.  Rather than attempting to solve the
   most general case, which many have found difficult, use Single Source
   Multicast [RFC3569]as the basic technology.  The fundamental problems
   are:

   o  Given a group prefix on the LAN in the upper enclave, how does one
      form a corresponding address on the cipher text side of the VPN
      Router?

   o  How does the plain text address Host 1 relate to routing of a
      multicast group used by Host 1?

   o  How does the corresponding cipher text group address relate to
      routing?

   o  How does a host in a remote enclave determine the plain text group
      address and join it?

   o  How does a VPN Router in front of a remote enclave determine the
      corresponding cipher text group address and join it?

   o  Presuming that the two VPN Routers are unknown to each other, how
      do they form the appropriate security association?

   o  How are keys exchanged?


3.1  Forming a ciphertext group address from a plaintext address

   Single Source Multicast identifies a multicast channel using the
   source address and group address as an {S,G} pair.  Using IPv6
   addresses, this has a natural breakdown: the Sender Address has a
   prefix part (a /64 prefix) and a host part, and the group address
   (defined in [I-D.ietf-ipv6-addr-arch-v4] and shown in Figure 6)
   similarly has 16 bits of discriminator, flags, and scope, and 112
   bits of Group ID.  For the purposes of this document, we will
   consider that Group ID to have 64 bits in its lower part and 48 bits
   in its upper part, and that the upper part represents a prefix that
   may be configured for a routing domain.  In this game, we will create
   the cipher text side of the VPN router's "sender address" just as we
   did in Section 2, and will additionally use the hash of the host part
   of the plain text group address.

   As shown in Figure 7, when a host joins a multicast tree emanating
   from a host in another enclave, the joins will migrate toward the
   sender following SSM's algorithms, and crossing the intervening VPN
   as through a tunnel.  When such a route is created, the following
   four elements are combined:

   o  a configured multicast group prefix used in the cipher text domain
      and unknown to the plain text side

   o  The IPv6 prefix used for unicast addresses in the cipher text
      domain.

   groups for each the plain text domain.  If a given host in the plain
   text domain requires multiple multicast groups, it creates multiple
   group addresses.


3.2  Routing to a remote address

   A host in a remote enclave determines the SSM channel identifier, an
   {S,G} address pair and joins it.  The "join" heads toward the VPN
   Router, which performs the same transformation as noted in
   Section 3.1, and the cipher text side of that system joins that
   multicast group.  As an example, assume that the enclaves in Figure 4
   have established unicast connectivity across the cipher text domain
   via the procedure described in Section 2.2.  Further assume that Host
   4 is the source of a plain text multicast group G. Host 1 learns of
   the SSM channel {Host 4, Group G} out of band.  It joins towards this
   channel through normal MLDv2 [RFC3810] multicast listener report
   messaging.  The plain text side of VPN Router 1 receives the report,
   hashes the source prefix (Host 4) and the host part of the plain text
   group address G, and communicates the hashed values to the cipher
   text side.  This triggers a join toward the cipher text multicast
   channel supporting the plain text channel.  The original join is also
   directed across a unicast security association to the plain text side
   of VPN Router 2, and continues joining toward Host 4.

   The cipher text side joins towards the cipher text domain connecting
   the enclaves using the source address formed by the procedure
   described in Section 2.2 and a cipher text group address formed by
   combining its configured cipher text multicast group prefix with the
   hashed host part of the plain text group address G. A source-specific
   tree is constructed through the domain and a join reaches the cipher
   text side of the source enclave's VPN router.  The source VPN router
   creates join state for the multicast channel on its cipher text side.
   When Host 4 transmits multicast packets on the channel, the plain
   text side of its VPN router passes the (encrypted) packet to the
   cipher text side along with a hash of the enclave unicast prefix and
   a hash of the host part of the plain text group address G. The packet
   is forwarded down the source-specific tree within the cipher text
   domain towards the VPN router fronting Host 1.  The VPN router
   decrypts the packet and passes it to its plain text side which
   forwards it to Host 1 due to the join state previously created via
   MLDv2.

   If the VPN routers do not border the same cipher text domain, they
   must know of each other's configured cipher text multicast prefixes
   prior to establishing the source-specific tree.  They may learn of
   their respective cipher text multicast prefixes through pre-
   configuration, or they may inform each other following the

   establishment of a unicast SA.

   One approach to distribution of the encryption key used by the
   multicast data stream and the multicast group's group address in the
   cipher text domain would be for VPN Router 1 to query VPN Router 2 in
   the black domain to determine what 48 bit group address portion,
   flags, and scope are in use and the key used for the channel.  This
   would occur using the cipher text domain's unicast security
   association.

   Since the components required in Section 3.1 are the same at both
   levels, both levels work.

4.  Key Management Procedures

4.1  Key Management Requirements

   The various ways that one hashes bits are checksum generation or
   cryptographic mechanisms.  These generally use some initial data to
   parameterise the algorithm; this may be included in the result or
   used (such as in a CRC) to select feedback paths in the algorithm, or
   other approaches.  For generality, in this document such parameters
   will be referred to as "keys".

   It is strongly desirable that a hypothetical security breach in one
   Internet protocol not automatically compromise other Internet
   protocols.  A key configured for use in this specification SHOULD NOT
   be stored using protocols or algorithms that have known flaws.

   Implementations MUST support the storage of more than one key at the
   same time, although it is recognized that only one key will normally
   be active on an interface.  They MUST associate a specific lifetime
   (i.e., date/time first valid and date/time no longer valid) and a key
   identifier with each key, and MUST support manual key distribution
   (e.g., the privileged user manually typing in the key, key lifetime,
   and key identifier on the router console).  The lifetime may be
   infinite.  If more than one algorithm is supported, then the
   implementation MUST require that the algorithm be specified for each
   key at the time the other key information is entered.  Keys that are
   out of date MAY be deleted at will by the implementation without
   requiring human intervention.  Manual deletion of active keys SHOULD
   also be supported.

4.2  Key Management Procedures

   As with all security methods using keys, it is necessary to change
   the key on a regular basis.  To maintain routing stability during
   such changes, implementations MUST be able to store and use more than
   one Key on a given interface at the same time.

   Each key will have its own Key Identifier, which is stored locally.
   The combination of the Key Identifier and the interface associated
   with the datagram uniquely identifies the algorithm and key in use.

   As noted above, the VPN Router will select a valid key from the set
   of valid keys for that interface.  The receiver will use the Key
   Identifier and interface to determine which key to use for
   authentication of the received datagram.  More than one key may be
   associated with an interface at the same time.

   Hence it is possible to have fairly smooth Key rollovers without

   losing legitimate traffic because the stored key is incorrect and
   without requiring people to change all the keys at once.  To ensure a
   smooth rollover, each communicating VPN Router must be updated with
   the new key several minutes before the current key will expire and
   several minutes before the new key lifetime begins.  The new key
   should have a lifetime that starts several minutes before the old key
   expires.  This gives time for each VPN Router to learn of the new key
   before that key will be used.  It also ensures that the new key will
   begin being used and the current key will go out of use before the
   current key's lifetime expires.  For the duration of the overlap in
   key lifetimes, a system may receive datagrams using either key and
   authenticate the datagram.  The Key-ID in the received datagram is
   used to select the appropriate key for authentication.

4.3  Pathological Cases

   Two pathological cases exist which must be handled, which are
   failures of the network manager.  Both of these should be exceedingly
   rare.

   During key switchover, devices may exist which have not yet been
   successfully configured with the new key.  Therefore, routers SHOULD
   implement (and would be well advised to implement) an algorithm that
   detects the set of keys being used by its neighbors, and transmits
   its datagrams using both the new and old keys until all of the
   neighbors are using the new key or the lifetime of the old key
   expires.  Under normal circumstances, this elevated transmission rate
   will exist for a single update interval.

   In the event that the last key associated with an interface expires,
   it is unacceptable to revert to an unauthenticated condition, and not
   advisable to disrupt routing.  Therefore, the router should send a
   "last authentication key expiration" notification to the network
   manager and treat the key as having an infinite lifetime until the
   lifetime is extended, the key is deleted by network management, or a
   new key is configured.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo adds no new IANA considerations.  The presence of this
   template text indicates that the author/editor has not actually
   reviewed IANA considerations.

   Note to RFC Editor: This section will have served its purpose if it
   correctly tells IANA that no new assignments or registries are
   required, or if those assignments or registries are created during
   the RFC publication process.  From the author's perspective, it may
   therefore be removed upon publication as an RFC at the RFC Editor's
   discretion.

6.  Security Considerations

   The specification of a set of acceptable hash mechanisms is beyond
   the scope of this document.  The choice of the exact hash
   algorithm(s) that may be employed is dependent on the security
   considerations of the customer provisioning the specific virtual
   private network.  As described in Section 1.4, possible algorithm
   choices are defined in MD5 [RFC1321], FIPS PUB 180-1 (SHA1) and ITU-T
   Recommendation V.41, "Code-independent error-control system"
   (CRC-32).

   The appropriate choice of hash algorithm(s) can sufficiently secure
   the plain text addresses which are hashed to derive cipher text
   addresses.  As an improvement to (static) configuration of cipher
   text addresses within the plain text databases of the VPN enclave,
   the automatic mechanism described in this document can easily
   complement other security procedures such as cipher text address
   change on a pseudo-random or periodic basis without manual
   intervention.

   Commentary from Brian Weis and Dave McGrew was very helpful.

   The authors of RFC 2082, from which the initial text of section 4 was
   remorselessly stolen, deserve credit for that contribution.
