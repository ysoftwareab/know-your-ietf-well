                     ALTO Performance Cost Metrics
                      draft-wu-alto-te-metrics-09

Abstract

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  Future extensions to ALTO may also use Cost
   Metric.

   Different applications may benefit from different Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a Resource Consumer may prefer Resource Providers that have
   low delay to the Resource Consumer.  However the base ALTO protocol
   [ALTO] has documented only a single cost metric, i.e., the generic
   "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2 of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).

   In this document, we proposes a set of Cost Metrics, derived and
   aggregated from routing protocols with different granularity and
   scope, such as BGP-LS,OSPF-TE and ISIS-TE, or from end to end traffic
   management tool.  We currently document 11 new Performance Metric to
   measure network delay, jitter, packet loss, hop count, and bandwidth.
   The metrics documented in this document provide a relatively
   comprehensive set of Cost Metrics for ALTO and allow applications to
   determine "where" to connect based on end to end network performance
   criteria.  Additional Cost Metrics such as financial cost metrics may
   be documented in other documents.

   Requirements Language The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

1.  Introduction

   Cost Metric is a basic concept in Application-Layer Traffic
   Optimization (ALTO).  It is used in both the Cost Map Service and the
   Endpoint Cost Service.  In particular, applications may benefit from
   knowing network performance measured on several Cost Metrics.  For
   example, a more delay sensitive application may focus on latency, and
   a more bandwidth-sensitive application may focus on available
   bandwidth.

   The objective of this document is to introduce 11 new performance
   cost metrics, listed in Table 1, to support the aforementioned
   applications and allow applications to determine "where" to connect
   based on end to end network performance criteria.  Hence, this
   document extends the base ALTO protocol [ALTO], which defines only a
   single cost metric, i.e., the generic "routingcost" metric (Sec. 14.2
   of ALTO base specification [ALTO]).

   An ALTO server may provide a subset of the cost metrics documented in
   this document.  These cost metrics can be retrieved and aggregated
   from routing protocol or other traffic measurement management tool
   (See Figure 1).  Note that these cost metrics are optional metrics
   and Not all these cost metrics need to be exposed to the application.

                    Figure 1.End to End Path Cost Metrics Exposing

   When an ALTO server supports a cost metric defined in this document,
   the server SHOULD announce the metric in its IRD.

   The definitions of a set of cost metrics can allow us to extend the
   ALTO base protocol (e.g., allowing output and constraints use
   different cost metrics), but such extensions are not in the scope of
   this document.

   One challenge in describing the metrics is that performance metrics
   often depend on configuration parameters.  For example, the value of
   packet loss rate depends on the measurement interval and varies over
   time.  To handle this issue, ALTO server may collect data on time
   periods covering the past, present or only collect data on present
   time.  The ALTO may further aggregate these data to provide an
   abstract and unified view that can be more useful to applications.
   To make the ALTO client understand whether the performance data is
   past data or present data, the ALTO server needs to expose to the
   client the validity period of each performance metric.

   Following the ALTO base protocol, this document uses JSON to specify
   the value type of each defined metric.  See [RFC4627] for JSON data
   type specification.

2.  Data sources, computation of defined cost metrics

   The cost metrics described in this document are similar, in that they
   may use similar data sources and have similar issues in their
   calculation.  Hence, instead of specifying such issues for each
   metric individually, we specify the common issue in this section.

2.1.  Data sources

   An ALTO server needs data sources to compute the cost metrics
   described in this document.  This document does not define the exact
   data sources.  For example, the ALTO server may use log servers or
   the OAM system as its data source [ALTO-DEPLOYMENT].  In particular,
   the cost metrics defined in this document can be computed using
   routing systems as the data sources.  Mechanisms defined in
   [RFC3630], [RFC3784], [OSPF-TE], [ISIS-TE], [BGP-LS] and [BGP-PM]
   that allow an ALTO Server to retrieve and derive the necessary
   information to compute the metrics that we described in this
   document.

2.2.  Computation of metrics

   An ALTO server processes measurements from data sources to compute
   exposed metrics.  It may need performance data processing tasks such
   as aggregating the results across multiple systems, removing
   outliers, and creating additional statistics.

   One specific challenge in deriving the metrics in this document is
   that these performance metrics depend on some configuration
   parameters.  For example, the value of packet loss rate depends on
   the measurement interval and varies over time.  If the ALTO server
   uses aforementioned routing protocol based mechanisms as data
   sources, then the measurement interval may be preconfigured by the
   routing protocol.  For example, Section 5 of [ISIS-TE] defines a
   default measurement interval of 30 seconds.  This document uses the
   term Measurement Interval to refer to the measurement interval used
   by the data sources.  In the [ISIS-TE] case, it is a measurement
   interval set by routing protocol.  The Measurement Interval(s) of the
   data sources can be different from the interval that this document
   derives the metric, e.g., the interval used by this document is
   multiple of measurement interval of the data sources.  Hence, an ALTO
   server needs to resolve the mismatch, when it happens.

   Another issue of converting from data source measurements to ALTO
   exposed metric values is that the measurement results that the ALTO
   Server retrieves may be defined for only links, and hence, the server
   will need to compose the link metrics to obtain path metrics used in
   services such as the Cost Map Service.  In this definition, we define

   the metrics to be independent of link or path, considering that
   future ALTO extensions may define link-based services, and hence the
   defined metrics should still be usable.

3.  Cost Metric: OWDelay

   Metric name:

      Periodic One Way Delay


   Metric Description:

      To specify spatial and temporal aggregated delay of a stream of
      packets exchanged between the specified source and destination or
      the time that the packet spends to travel from source to
      destination.  The spatial aggregation unit is specified in the
      query context (e.g., PID to PID, or endpoint to endpoint); and the
      temporal unit is specified as the measurement interval in the
      query context.


   Method of Measurement or Calculation:

      See section 8.3 of [I-D.ietf-ippm-initial-registry] for
      Measurement Method.


   Units of Measurement:

      This is intended to be a constraint attribute value.  A Cost Mode
      is encoded as a US-ASCII string.  The Metric value Type is a
      single 'JSONNumber' type value containing a non-negative integer
      component that may be followed by an exponent part.

      This metric could be used as a cost metric constraint attribute
      used either together with cost metric attribute 'routingcost' or
      on its own or as a returned cost metric in the response.

14.  Security Considerations

   The properties defined in this document present no security
   considerations beyond those in Section 15 of the base ALTO
   specification [ALTO].

   However concerns addressed in Sections "15.1 Authenticity and
   Integrity of ALTO Information", "15.2 Potential Undesirable Guidance

   from Authenticated ALTO Information" and "15.3 Confidentiality of
   ALTO Information" remain of utmost importance.  Indeed, TE
   performance is a highly sensitive ISP information and sharing TE
   metric values in numerical mode requires full mutual confidence
   between the entities managing the ALTO Server and Client.  Numerical
   TE performance information will most likely be distributed by ALTO
   Servers to Clients under strict and formal mutual trust agreements.
   One the other hand, ALTO Clients must be cognizant on the risks
   attached to such information that they would have acquired outside
   formal conditions of mutual trust.

15.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has added the following entries to the ALTO cost map Properties
   registry, defined in Section 3 of [RFCXXX].

      +-----------+--------------+------------------------+
      | Namespace | Property     | Reference              |

      |           | pktloss      | [RFCxxxx], Section 5   |
      |           | hopcount     | [RFCxxxx], Section 6   |
      |           | bandwidth    | [RFCxxxx], Section 7   |
      |           | maxbw        | [RFCxxxx], Section 8   |
