1. Introduction

   This memo defines an experimental portion of the Management
   Information Base (MIB) for use with network management protocols
   in the Internet community. In particular, it describes managed
   objects for modeling a Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)
   [MPLSArch, MPLSFW] Label Switch Router (LSR).
   
   Comments should be made directly to the MPLS mailing list at
   mpls@uu.net.
   
   This memo does not, in its draft form, specify a standard for the
   Internet community.


2. Terminology
   
   This document uses terminology from the document describing the
   MPLS architecture [MPLSArch]. A label switched path (LSP) is
   modeled as a connection consisting of one or more incoming
   segments (in-segments) and/or one or more outgoing segments (out-
   segments) at a label switch router (LSR). The association or
   interconnection of the in-segments and out-segments is
   accomplished by using a cross-connect. We use the terminology
   "connection" and "LSP" interchangeably where the meaning is clear
   from the context.


3. The SNMP Management Framework
   
   The SNMP Management Framework presently consists of five major
   components:
   
   -  An overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [SNMPArch].
   
   -  Mechanisms for describing and naming objects and events for the
      purpose of management.  The first version of this Structure of
      Management Information (SMI) is called SMIv1 and described in
      RFC 1155 [SMIv1], RFC 1212 [SNMPv1MIBDef] and RFC 1215
      [SNMPv1Traps].  The second version, called SMIv2, is described
      in RFC 1902 [SMIv2], RFC 1903 [SNMPv2TC] and RFC 1904
      [SNMPv2Conf].
   
   -  Message protocols for transferring management information.  The
      first version of the SNMP message protocol is called SNMPv1
      and described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second version of the
      SNMP message protocol, which is not an Internet standards
      track protocol, is called SNMPv2c and described in RFC 1901
      [SNMPv2c] and RFC 1906 [SNMPv2TM].  The third version of the
      message protocol is called SNMPv3 and described in RFC 1906
      [SNMPv2TM], RFC 2272 [SNMPv3MP] and RFC 2574 [SNMPv3USM].

Internet Draft               MPLS LSR MIB               Feb. 16, 2000



   -  Protocol operations for accessing management information.  The
      first set of protocol operations and associated PDU formats is
      described in RFC 1157 [SNMPv1].  A second set of protocol
      operations and associated PDU formats is described in RFC 1905
      [SNMPv2PO].
   
   -  A set of fundamental applications described in RFC 2273
      [SNMPv3App] and the view-based access control mechanism
      described in RFC 2575 [SNMPv3VACM].
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB
   are defined using the mechanisms defined in the SMI.  This memo
   specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
   conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
   translations.  The resulting translated MIB must be semantically
   equivalent, except where objects or events are omitted because no
   translation is possible (use of Counter64).  Some machine-readable
   information in SMIv2 will be converted into textual descriptions
   in SMIv1 during the translation process.  However, this loss of
   machine-readable information is not considered to change the
   semantics of the MIB.


3.1.  Object Definitions
   
   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
   termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  Objects in the MIB
   are defined using the subset of Abstract Syntax Notation One
   (ASN.1) defined in the SMI.  In particular, each object type is
   named by an OBJECT IDENTIFIER, an administratively assigned name.
   The object type together with an object instance serves to
   uniquely identify a specific instantiation of the object.  For
   human convenience, we often use a textual string, termed the
   descriptor, to also refer to the object type.


4. Feature Checklist
   
   The MPLS label switch router MIB (LSR-MIB) is designed to satisfy
   the following requirements and constraints:
   
   -  The MIB should be able to support both manually configured LSPs
      as well as those configured via CR-LDP and/or RSVP signaling.
   
   -  The MIB must support the enabling and disabling of MPLS
      capability on MPLS capable interfaces of an LSR.
   
   -  The MIB should allow resource sharing between two or more LSPs.

Internet Draft               MPLS LSR MIB               Feb. 16, 2000



   -  Both per-platform and per-interface label spaces must be
      supported.
   
   -  MPLS packets must be forwarded solely based on an incoming top
      label [MPLSArch, LblStk].
   
   -  Support must be provided for next-hop resolution when the
      outgoing interface is a shared media interface.  In the point-
      to-multipoint case, each outgoing segment can reside on a
      different shared media interface.
   
   -  The MIB must support point-to-point, point-to-multipoint and
      multipoint-to-point connections at an LSR.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections all outgoing packets must
      have the same top label.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections, the outgoing resources of
      the merged connections must be shared.
   
   -  For multipoint-to-point connections, packets from different
      incoming connections may have distinct outgoing label stacks
      beneath the (identical) top label.
   
   -  In the point-to-multipoint case each outgoing connection can
      have a distinct label stack including the top label.
   
   -  All the members of a point-to-multipoint connection share the
      resources allocated for the ingress segments.
   
   -  The MIB must provide cross-connect capability to "pop" an
      incoming label and forward the packet with the remainder of
      the label stack unchanged and without pushing any labels ("pop-
      and-go") [LblStk].
   
   -  It must be possible to assign or re-map the Class of Service
      (COS) bits [LblStk] on the outgoing label. In the multipoint-
      to-point case, each in-segment can have a different outgoing
      COS value.  In the point-to-multipoint case, each out-segment
      can have a different outgoing COS value.
   
   -  It should be possible to support persistent as well as non-
      persistent LSPs.
   
   -  Performance counters must be provided for in-segments and out-
      segments as well as for measuring MPLS performance on a per-
      interface basis.


5. Outline

Internet Draft               MPLS LSR MIB               Feb. 16, 2000



   
   Configuring LSPs through an LSR involves the following steps:
   
   -  Enabling MPLS on MPLS capable interfaces.
   
   -  Configuring in-segments and out-segments.
   
   -  Setting up the cross-connect table to associate segments and/or
      to indicate connection origination and termination.
   
   -  Optionally specifying label stack actions.
   
   -  Optionally specifying segment traffic parameters.


5.1.  Summary of LSR MIB
   
   The MIB objects for performing these actions consist of the
   following tables:
   
   -  The interface configuration table (mplsInterfaceConfTable),
      which is used for enabling the MPLS protocol on MPLS-capable
      interfaces.
   
   -  The in-segment (mplsInSegmentTable) and out-segment
      (mplsOutSegmentTable) tables, which are used for configuring
      LSP segments at an LSR.
   
   -  The cross-connect table (mplsXCTable), which is used to
      associate in and out segments together, in order to form a
      cross-connect.
   
   -  The label stack table (mplsLabelStackTable), which is used for
      specifying label stack operations.
   
   -  The TSpec table (mplsTSpecTable), which is used for specifying
      LSP-related traffic parameters.
   
   Further, the MPLS in-segment and out-segment performance tables,
   mplsInSegmentPerfTable and mplsOutSegmentPerfTable, contain the
   objects necessary to measure the performance of LSPs, and
   mplsInterfacePerfTable has objects to measure MPLS performance on
   a per-interface basis.
   
   These tables are described in the subsequent sections.


6. Brief Description of MIB Objects
   
   Sections 6.1-6.3 describe objects pertaining to MPLS capable



Srinivasan et al.             Expires August 2000            [Page 5]


Internet Draft               MPLS LSR MIB               Feb. 16, 2000



   interfaces of an LSR. The objects described in Sections 6.4-6.9,
   when considered together, are equivalent to the tables described
   in the MPLS architecture document [MPLSArch], that is, the
   Incoming Label Map (ILM) and the Next Hop Label Forwarding Entry
   (NHLFE) tables. Section 6.10 describes objects for specifying
   traffic parameters for in and out segments.


6.1.  mplsInterfaceConfTable
   
   This table represents the interfaces that are MPLS capable.  An
   LSR creates an entry in this table for every MPLS capable
   interface on that LSR.  Each entry contains information about per-
   interface label ranges.  The administrator can specify the desired
   MPLS status (enable/up, disable/down, testing) of an interface by
   writing the object mplsInterfaceAdminStatus.  The actual status is
   indicated by the object mplsInterfaceOperStatus.


6.2.  mplsInterfaceResTable
   
   This table provides resource information such as available and
   allocated bandwidth and buffers on each MPLS capable interface for
   each priority level.


6.3.  mplsInterfacePerfTable
   
   This table contains objects to measure the MPLS performance of
   MPLS capable interfaces and is an AUGMENT to
   mplsInterfaceConfTable.  High capacity counters are provided for
   objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on high-speed
   interfaces.


6.4.  mplsInSegmentTable
   
   This table contains a description of the incoming MPLS segments to
   an LSR and their associated parameters.


6.5.  mplsInSegmentPerfTable
   
   The MPLS In-Segment Performance Table has objects to measure the
   performance of an incoming segment configured on an LSR.  It is an
   AUGMENT to mplsInSegmentTable.  High capacity counters are
   provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on
   high-speed interfaces.

Internet Draft               MPLS LSR MIB               Feb. 16, 2000



6.6.  mplsOutSegmentTable
   
   The Out-Segment Table contains a description of the outgoing MPLS
   segments at an LSR and their associated parameters.


6.7.  mplsOutSegmentPerfTable
   
   The MPLS Out-Segment Table contains objects to measure the
   performance of an outgoing segment configured on an LSR.  It is an
   AUGMENT to mplsOutSegmentTable.  High capacity counters are
   provided for objects that are likely to wrap around quickly on
   high-speed interfaces.


6.8.  mplsXCTable
   
   The mplsXCTable specifies information for associating segments
   together in order to instruct the LSR to switch between the
   specified segments.  It supports point-to-point, point-to-multi-
   point and multi-point-to-point connections.


6.9.  mplsLabelStackTable
   
   The mplsLabelStackTable specifies the label stack to be pushed
   onto a packet, beneath the top label.  Entries to this table are
   referred to from mplsXCTable.


6.10. mplsTSpecTable
   
   The mplsTSpecTable contains objects for specifying the traffic
   parameters of in-segments and out-segments. Entries in this table
   are referred to from mplsInSegmentTable and mplsOutSegmentTable.


7. Example of LSP Setup
   
   In this section we provide a brief example of using the MIB
   objects described in Section 8 to set up an LSP. While this
   example is not meant to illustrate every nuance of the MIB, it is
   intended as an aid to understanding some of the key concepts. It
   is meant to be read after going through the MIB itself.
   
   Suppose that one would like to manually create a best-effort,
   unidirectional LSP. Assume that the LSP enters the LSR via MPLS
   interface A with ifIndex 12 and exits the LSR via MPLS interface B
   with ifIndex 13. Let us assume that we do not wish to have a label
   stack beneath the top label on the outgoing labeled packets.  The

   following example illustrates which rows and corresponding objects
   might be created to accomplish this.
   
   First, the TSpec entries must be set-up for both segments.
   
   In mplsTSpecTable for the incoming direction:
   {
      mplsTSpecIndex           = 5
      mplsTSpecDirection       = in(1),
      mplsTSpecMaxRate         = 100000,
      mplsTSpecMeanRate        = 100000,
      mplsTSpecMaxBurstSize    = 2000,
      mplsTSpecRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   In mplsTSpecTable for the outgoing direction:
   {
      mplsTSpecIndex           = 6
      mplsTSpecDirection       = out(2),
      mplsTSpecMaxRate         = 100000,
      mplsTSpecMeanRate        = 100000,
      mplsTSpecMaxBurstSize    = 2000,
      mplsTSpecRowStatus       = createAndGo(4)
   
   }
   
   Note that if we were setting up a bi-directional LSP, the segments
   in the reverse direction can share the TSpec entries (and hence
   resources) with the segments in the forward direction.
   
   We must next create the appropriate in-segment and out-segment
   entries with suitable traffic parameters by pointing to the
   appropriate TSpec entries that we have just created.
   
   
   In mplsInSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsInSegmentIfIndex     = 12, -- incoming interface
      mplsInSegmentLabel       = 21, -- incoming label
      mplsInSegmentNPop        = 1,
      mplsInSegmentTSpecIndex  = 5,
      mplsInSegmentRowStatus   = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   In mplsOutSegmentTable:
   {
      mplsOutSegmentIndex          = 1,
      mplsOutSegmentIfIndex        = 13, -- outgoing interface
      mplsOutSegmentPushTopLabel   = true(1),
      mplsOutSegmentTopLabel       = 22, -- outgoing label

Internet Draft               MPLS LSR MIB               Feb. 16, 2000



      mplsOutSegmentTSpecIndex     = 6,
      mplsOutSegmentRowStatus      = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Next, a cross-connect entry is created thereby associating the
   newly created segments together.
   
   In mplsXCTable:
   {
      mplsXCIndex             = 2,
      mplsXCLspId             = "1.2.3.4-2",
      mplsInSegmentIfIndex    = 12,
      mplsInSegmentLabel      = 21,
      mplsOutSegmentIndex     = 1,
      mplsXCCOS               = 0,
      mplsXCIsPersistent      = false (1),
      mplsLabelStackIndex     = 0, -- only a single outgoing label
      mplsXCRowStatus         = createAndGo(4)
   }
   
   Note that the mplsInSegmentXCIndex and mplsOutSegmentXCIndex
   objects will automatically be populated with the value 2 when
   these segments are referred to from the corresponding cross-
   connect entry.


8. Application of the Interface Group to MPLS
   
   The Interfaces Group of MIB II defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  This memo contains the media-specific
   extensions to the Interfaces Group for managing MPLS interfaces.
   
   This memo assumes the interpretation of the Interfaces Group to be
   in accordance with [IFMIB] which states that the interfaces table
   (ifTable) contains information on the managed resource's
   interfaces and that each sub-layer below the internetwork layer of
   a network interface is considered an interface.  Thus, the MPLS
   layer interface is represented as an entry in the ifTable.  This
   entry is concerned with the MPLS layer as a whole, and not with
   individual LSPs/tunnels which are managed via the MPLS-specific
   managed objects specified in this memo and [TEMIB].  The inter-
   relation of entries in the ifTable is defined by Interfaces Stack
   Group defined in [IFMIB].


8.1.  Support of the MPLS Layer by ifTable
   
   Some specific interpretations of ifTable for the MPLS layer
   follow.

   DESCRIPTION
       "An identifier that is assigned to each LSP and is
        used to uniquely identify it. This is assigned at
        the head end of the LSP and can be used by all LSRs
        to identify this LSP. This value is piggybacked by
        the signaling protocol when this LSP is signaled
        within the network. This identifier can then be used
        at each LSR to identify which labels are being
        swapped to other labels for this LSP. For IPv4
        addresses this results in a 6-octet long cookie."

-- An MPLS label.
MplsLabel ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
   STATUS        current
   DESCRIPTION
       "Represents an MPLS label.  Note that the contents of
        a label field are interpreted in an interface-type
        specific fashion.  For example, the 20-bit wide
        label carried in the MPLS shim header is contained
        in bits 0-19 and bits 20-31 must be zero.  The frame
        relay label can be either 10, 17 or 23 bits wide
        depending on the size of the DLCI field and bits 10-
        31, 17-31 or 23-31 must be zero, respectively.  For
        an ATM interface, bits 0-15 must be interpreted as
        the VCI, bits 16-23 as the VPI and bits 24-31 must
        be zero.  Note that the permissible label values are
        also a function of the interface type.  For example,
        the value 3 has special semantics in the control
        plane for an MPLS shim header label and is not a
        valid label value in the data path."

10.   Security Considerations



Srinivasan et al.            Expires August 2000            [Page 50]


Internet Draft               MPLS LSR MIB               Feb. 16, 2000



   
   It is clear that this MIB is potentially useful for monitoring of
   MPLS LSRs. This MIB can also be used for configuration of certain
   objects, and anything that can be configured can be incorrectly
   configured, with potentially disastrous results.
   
   At this writing, no security holes have been identified beyond
   those that SNMP Security [SNMPArch] is itself intended to address.
   These relate to primarily controlled access to sensitive
   information and the ability to configure a device - or which might
   result from operator error, which is beyond the scope of any
   security architecture.
   
   
   
   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB which
   have a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create. Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect
   on network operations. The use of SNMP Version 3 is recommended
   over prior versions, for configuration control, as its security
   model is improved.
   
   SNMPv1 or SNMPv2 are by themselves not a secure environment. Even
   if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec
   [IPSEC]), there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
   objects in this MIB. It is recommended that the implementers
   consider the security features as provided by the SNMPv3
   framework. Specifically, the use of the User-based Security Model
   [SNMPv3USM] and the View- based Access Control [SNMPv3VACM] is
   recommended. It is then a customer/user responsibility to ensure
   that the SNMP entity giving access to an instance of this MIB is
   properly configured to give access to the objects only to those
   principals (users) that have legitimate rights to indeed GET or
   SET (change/create/delete) them.
   
   There are a number of managed objects in this MIB that may contain
   information that may be sensitive from a business perspective, in
   that they represent a customer's interface to the MPLS network.
   Allowing uncontrolled access to these objects could result in
   malicious and unwanted disruptions of network traffic or incorrect
   configurations for these customers. There are no objects that are
   particularly sensitive in their own right, such as passwords or
   monetary amounts.
