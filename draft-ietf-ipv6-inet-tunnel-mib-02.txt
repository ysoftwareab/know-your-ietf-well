Draft                     Inet Tunnel MIB              August 2004


Abstract

This memo defines a Management Information Base (MIB) module for
use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
In particular, it describes managed objects used for managing
tunnels of any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks.  Extension MIB
modules may be designed for managing protocol-specific objects.
Likewise, extension MIB modules may be designed for managing
security-specific objects.  This MIB module does not support
tunnels over non-IP networks.  Management of such tunnels may be
supported by other MIB modules.

This memo obsoletes RFC 2667.


1.  Introduction

Over the past several years, there have been a number of
"tunneling" protocols specified by the IETF (see [RFC1241] for an
early discussion of the model and examples).  This document
describes a Management Information Base (MIB) module used for
managing tunnels of any type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks,
including GRE [RFC1701,RFC1702], IP-in-IP [RFC2003], Minimal
Encapsulation [RFC2004], L2TP [RFC2661], PPTP [RFC2637], L2F
[RFC2341], UDP (e.g., [RFC1234]), ATMP [RFC2107], and IPv6-in-IPv4
[RFC2893] tunnels, among others.

Extension MIB modules may be designed for managing protocol-
specific objects.  Likewise, extension MIB modules may be designed
for managing security-specific objects (e.g., IPSEC [RFC2401]),
and traffic conditioner [RFC2474] objects.


2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7
of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store,
termed the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are
generally accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol
(SNMP).  Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms
defined in the Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This
memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which

Draft                     Inet Tunnel MIB              August 2004


is described in STD 58, RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579
[RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580 [RFC2580].


3.  Overview

This MIB module contains two current tables and one deprecated
table.  The current tables are:

o    the Tunnel Interface Table, containing information on the
     tunnels known to a router; and

o    the Tunnel Inet Config Table, which can be used for dynamic
     creation of tunnels, and also provides a mapping from
     endpoint addresses to the current interface index value.

The version of this MIB module that appeared in RFC 2667 contained
the Tunnel Config Table, which mapped IPv4 endpoint addresses to
interface indexes.  It is now deprecated in favor of the Tunnel
Inet Config Table.


3.1.  Relationship to the Interfaces MIB

This section clarifies the relationship of this MIB module to the
Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  Several areas of correlation are
addressed in the following subsections.  The implementor is
referred to the Interfaces MIB document in order to understand the
general intent of these areas.


3.1.1.  Layering Model

Each logical interface (physical or virtual) has an ifEntry in the
Interfaces MIB [RFC2863].  Tunnels are handled by creating a
logical interface (ifEntry) for each tunnel. These are then
correlated, using the ifStack table of the Interfaces MIB, to
those interfaces on which the local IPv4 or IPv6 addresses of the
tunnels are configured.  The basic model, therefore, looks
something like this (for example):

      | |         | |          | |
   +--+ +---+  +--+ +---+      | |
   |IP-in-IP|  |  GRE   |      | |
   | tunnel |  | tunnel |      | |

   +--+ +---+  +--+ +---+      | |
      | |         | |          | |    <== attachment to underlying
   +--+ +---------+ +----------+ +--+     interfaces, to be provided
   |       Physical interface       |     by ifStack table
   +--------------------------------+


3.1.2.  ifRcvAddressTable

The ifRcvAddressTable usage can be defined in the MIB modules
defining the encapsulation below the network layer, and holds the
local IP addresses on which decapsulation will occur.  For
example, if IP-in-IP encapsulation is being used, the
ifRcvAddressTable can be defined by IP- in-IP.  If it is not
specified, the default is that one entry will exist for the tunnel
interface, where ifRcvAddressAddress contains the local IP address
used for encapsulation/decapsulation (i.e.,
tunnelIfLocalInetAddress in the Tunnel Interface Table).


3.1.3.  ifEntry

IfEntries are defined in the MIB modules defining the
encapsulation below the network layer.  For example, if IP-in-IP
encapsulation [20] is being used, the ifEntry is defined by IP-in-
IP.

The ifType of a tunnel should be set to "tunnel" (131).  An entry
in the IP Tunnel MIB module will exist for every ifEntry with this
ifType.  An implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB module may allow
ifEntries to be created via the tunnelConfigTable.  Creating a
tunnel will also add an entry in the ifTable and in the
tunnelIfTable, and deleting a tunnel will likewise delete the
entry in the ifTable and the tunnelIfTable.

The use of two different tables in this MIB module was an
important design decision.  Traditionally, ifIndex values are
chosen by agents, and are permitted to change across restarts.
Allowing row creation directly in the Tunnel Interface Table,
indexed by ifIndex, would complicate row creation and/or cause
interoperability problems (if each agent had special restrictions
on ifIndex). Instead, a separate table is used which is indexed
only by objects over which the manager has control.  Namely, these
are the addresses of the tunnel endpoints and the encapsulation
protocol.  Finally, an additional manager- chosen ID is used in

the index to support protocols such as L2F which allow multiple
tunnels between the same endpoints.

    DESCRIPTION
            "IPv4-specific objects were deprecated, including
            tunnelIfLocalAddress, tunnelIfRemoteAddress, the
            tunnelConfigTable, and the tunnelMIBBasicGroup.

            Added IP version-agnostic objects that should be used
            instead, including tunnelIfAddressType,
            tunnelIfLocalInetAddress, tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress,
            the tunnelInetConfigTable, and the
            tunnelIMIBInetGroup.

            The new tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and
            tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress objects are read-write,
            rather than read-only.

            Updated DESCRIPTION clauses of existing version-
            agnostic objects (e.g., tunnelIfTOS) that contained
            IPv4-specific text to cover IPv6 as well.

            Added tunnelIfFlowLabel for tunnels over IPv6.

            The encapsulation method was previously an INTEGER
            type, and is now an IANA-maintained textual
            convention.

            created, or old entries deleted from this table. The
            agent need not support setting this object to
            createAndWait or notInService since there are no other
            writable objects in this table, and writable objects
            in rows of corresponding tables such as the
            tunnelIfTable may be modified while this row is
            active.

            To create a row in this table for an encapsulation
            method which does not support multiple parallel
            tunnels with the same endpoints, the management
            station should simply use a tunnelConfigID of 1, and
            set tunnelConfigStatus to createAndGo.  For
            encapsulation methods such as L2F which allow multiple
            parallel tunnels, the management station may select a
            pseudo-random number to use as the tunnelConfigID and
            set tunnelConfigStatus to createAndGo.  In the event
            that this ID is already in use and an
            inconsistentValue is returned in response to the set
            operation, the management station should simply select
            a new pseudo-random number and retry the operation.

            Creating a row in this table will cause an interface
            index to be assigned by the agent in an
            implementation-dependent manner, and corresponding
            rows will be instantiated in the ifTable and the

5.  IANA Considerations

This document introduces a new IANA-maintained textual convention
(TC) which is to be added to the IANAifType-MIB [IFTYPE].  The
initial version of this IANAtunnelType TC can be found in Appendix
A.  The current version of the textual convention can be accessed
at http://www.iana.org/assignments/ianaiftype-mib

The policy for assigning new IANAtunnelType values is First Come
First Served, as defined in [RFC2434], just as it is for new
IANAifTypes values.  The assignment policy for IANAtunnelType
values should always be identical to the policy for assigning
IANAifType values.

New types of tunnels over IPv4 or IPv6 should not be assigned
IANAifType values.  Instead, they should be assigned
IANAtunnelType values and hence reuse the interface type
tunnel(131).  (Note this restriction does not apply to "tunnels"
which are not over IPv4 or IPv6.)

Previously tunnel types which were not point-to-point tunnels were
problematic in that they could not be properly expressed in the
tunnel MIB, and hence were assigned IANAifType values.  This
document now corrects this problem, and as a result, IANA should
deprecate the sixToFour(215) IANAifType value in favor of the
sixToFour(11) IANAtunnelType value.


6.  Security Considerations

There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB
module with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.
Such objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some
network environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-
secure environment without proper protection can have a negative
effect on network operations.

Unauthorized write access to any of the writable objects could
cause unauthorized creation and/or manipulation of tunnels,
resulting in a denial of service, or redirection of packets to an
arbitrary destination.

Draft                     Inet Tunnel MIB              August 2004


Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects
with a MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered
sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus
important to control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these
objects and possibly to even encrypt the values of these objects
when sending them over the network via SNMP.

Unauthorized read access to tunnelIfLocalInetAddress,
tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress, tunnelIfLocalAddress,
tunnelIfRemoteAddress, or any object in the tunnelConfigTable or
tunnelInetConfigTable would reveal information about the tunnel
topology.

SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the
objects in this MIB module.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features
as provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms
(for authentication and privacy).

Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access
to the objects only to those principals (users) that have
legitimate rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete)
them.


7.  Changes since RFC 2667

IPv4-specific objects were deprecated, including
tunnelIfLocalAddress, tunnelIfRemoteAddress, the
tunnelConfigTable, and the tunnelMIBBasicGroup.

Added IP version-agnostic objects that should be used instead,
including tunnelIfAddressType, tunnelIfLocalInetAddress,
tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress, the tunnelInetConfigTable, and the
tunnelIMIBInetGroup.

Draft                     Inet Tunnel MIB              August 2004


The new tunnelIfLocalInetAddress and tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress
objects are read-write, rather than read-only.

Updated DESCRIPTION clauses of existing version-agnostic objects
(e.g., tunnelIfTOS) that contained IPv4-specific text to cover
IPv6 as well.

Added tunnelIfFlowLabel for tunnels over IPv6.

The encapsulation method was previously an INTEGER type, and is
now an IANA-maintained textual convention.


8.  Acknowledgements

This MIB module was updated based on feedback from the IETF's
Interfaces MIB (IF-MIB) and Point-to-Point Protocol Extensions
(PPPEXT) Working Groups.  Mike Heard also provided valuable MIB
guidance on this version.

12.  Appendix A: IANA Tunnel Type TC

This appendix defines the initial content of the IANAtunnelType
textual convention which should appear in the IANAifType-MIB.

IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION
    STATUS     current
    DESCRIPTION
            "The encapsulation method used by a tunnel. The value
            direct indicates that a packet is encapsulated
            directly within a normal IP header, with no
            intermediate header, and unicast to the remote tunnel
            endpoint (e.g., an RFC 2003 IP-in-IP tunnel, or an RFC
            1933 IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnel). The value minimal indicates
            that a Minimal Forwarding Header (RFC 2004) is
            inserted between the outer header and the payload

            packet. The value UDP indicates that the payload
            packet is encapsulated within a normal UDP packet
            (e.g., RFC 1234).

            The values sixToFour, sixOverFour, and isatap
            indicates that an IPv6 packet is encapsulated directly
            within an IPv4 header, with no intermediate header,
            and unicast to the destination determined by the 6to4,
            6over4, or ISATAP protocol.

            The remaining protocol-specific values indicate that a
            header of the protocol of that name is inserted
            between the outer header and the payload header."
