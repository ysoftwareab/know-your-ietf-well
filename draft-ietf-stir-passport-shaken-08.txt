                   PASSporT SHAKEN Extension (SHAKEN)
                   draft-ietf-stir-passport-shaken-08

Abstract

   This document extends PASSporT, which is a token object that conveys
   cryptographically-signed information about the participants involved
   in communications.  The extension is defined, corresponding to the
   SHAKEN specification, to provide both a specific set of levels-of-
   confidence in the correctness of the originating identity for a SIP
   based Communication Service Provider (CSP) telephone network
   originated call as well as an identifier that allows the CSP to
   uniquely identify the origin of the call within its network.

1.  Introduction

   The Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs
   (SHAKEN) [ATIS-1000074] specification defines a framework for using
   Secure Telephone Identity Revisited (STIR) protocols including
   PASSporT [RFC8225], SIP Authenticated Identity Management [RFC8224]
   and the STIR certificate framework [RFC8226] for implementing the
   cryptographic validation of an authorized originator of telephone
   calls using SIP.  Because the current telephone network contains both
   VoIP and TDM/SS7 originated traffic, there are many scenarios that
   need to be accounted for where PASSporT signatures may represent
   either direct or indirect call origination scenarios.  The SHAKEN
   [ATIS-1000074] specification defines levels of attestation of the
   origination of the call as well as an origination identifier that can
   help create a unique association between the origin of a particular
   call to the point in the VoIP or TDM telephone network the call came
   from to identify, for example, either a customer or class of service
   that call represents.  This document specifies these values as claims
   to extend the base set of PASSporT claims.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   In addition, the following terms are used in this document:

   o  Verified association: is typically defined as an authenticated
      relationship between a customer and a device that initiated a call
      on behalf of that customer, for example, a subscriber account with
      a specific SIM card or set of SIP credentials.

   o  PASSporT: Defined in [RFC8225] is a JSON Web Token [RFC7519]
      defined specifically for securing the identity of an initiator of
      personal communication.  This document defines a specific
      extension to PASSporT.

3.  Overview of 'shaken' PASSporT extension

   The SHAKEN framework is designed to use PASSporT [RFC8225] as a
   method of asserting the telephone number calling identity.  In
   addition to the PASSporT base claims, there are two additional claims
   that have been defined for the needs of a service provider to signal
   information beyond just the telephone identity.  First, in order to
   help bridge the transition of the state of the current telephone
   network which has calls with no authentication and non-SIP [RFC3261]
   signaling not compatible with the use of PASSporT and Secure
   Telephone Identity (STI) in general, there is an attestation claim.
   This provides three levels of attestation, including a full
   attestation when the service provider can fully attest to the calling
   identity, a partial attestation, when the service provider originated
   a telephone call but can not fully attest to the calling identity,
   and a gateway attestation which is the lowest level of attestation
   and represents the service provider receiving a call from a non-
   PASSporT and non-STI supporting telephone gateway.

   The second claim is a unique origination identifier that should be
   used by the service provider to identify different sources of
   telephone calls to support a traceback mechanism that can be used for
   enforcement and identification of a source of illegitimate calls.

   The use of the compact form of PASSporT is not specified in this
   document and is not specified for use in SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074].

   The next two sections define these new claims.

4.  PASSporT 'attest' Claim

   This indicator allows for both identifying the service provider that
   is vouching for the call as well as clearly indicating what
   information the service provider is attesting to.  The 'attest' claim
   can be one of the following three values: 'A', 'B', or 'C'.  These
   values correspond to 'Full Attestation', 'Partial Attestation', and
   'Gateway Attestation', respectively.  See [ATIS-1000074] for the
   definitions of these three levels of attestation.

5.  PASSporT 'origid' Claim

   The purpose of the 'origid' claim is described in [ATIS-1000074].
   The value of 'origid' claim is a UUID as defined in [RFC4122].
   Please refer to Section 10 for a discussion of the privacy
   considerations around the use of this value.

6.  Example "shaken" PASSporT

   Protected Header
   {
      "alg":"ES256",
      "typ":"passport",
      "ppt":"shaken",
      "x5u":"https://cert.example.org/passport.cer"
   }
   Payload
   {
      "attest":"A"
      "dest":{"tn":["12155550131"]}
      "iat":"1443208345",
      "orig":{"tn":"12155550121"},
      "origid":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
   }

7.  Using 'shaken' in SIP

   The use of the 'shaken' PASSporT type and the claims 'attest' and
   'origid' are formally defined in [ATIS-1000074] for usage in SIP
   [RFC3261] aligned with the use of the identity header field defined
   in [RFC8224].

8.  Order of Claim Keys

   The order of the claim keys MUST follow the rules of [RFC8225]
   Section 9; the claim keys MUST appear in lexicographic order.
   Therefore, the claim keys discussed in this document appear in the
   PASSporT Payload in the following order,

   o  attest

   o  dest

   o  iat

   o  orig

   o  origid

9.  Security Considerations

   This document defines a new PASSporT [RFC8225] extension.  The
   considerations related to the security of the PASSporT object itself
   are the same as those described in [RFC8225].

   [RFC8224] defines how to compare the values of the "dest", "orig" and
   "iat" claims against fields in a SIP containing a PASSporT as part of
   validating that request.  The values of the new "attest" and "origid"
   claims added by this extension are not used in such a validation
   step.  They are not compared to fields in the SIP message.  Instead,
   they simply carry additional information from the signer to the
   consumer of the PASSport.  This new information shares the same
   integrity protection and non-repudiation properties as the base
   claims in the PASSporT.

10.  Privacy Considerations

   As detailed in [RFC3261] Section 26, SIP messages inherently carry
   identifying information of the caller and callee.  The addition of
   STIR cryptographically attests that the signing party vouches for the
   information given about the callee, as is discussed in the Privacy
   Considerations of [RFC8224].

   SHAKEN [ATIS-1000074] furthermore adds an 'origid' value to the STIR
   PASSporT, which is an opaque unique identifier representing an
   element on the path of a given SIP request.  This identifier is
   generated by an originating telephone service provider to identify
   where within their network (e.g. a gateway or particular service
   element) a call was initiated; 'origid' can facilitate forensic
   analysis of call origins when identifying and stopping bad actors
   trying to spoof identities or make fraudulent calls.

   The opacity of the 'origid' claim value is intended to minimize
   exposure of information about the origination of calls labelled with
   an 'origid' value.  It is therefore RECOMMENDED that implementations
   generate a unique 'origid' value per call in such a way that only the
   generator of the 'origid' can determine when two 'origid' values

Internet-Draft                   shaken                       March 2019


   represent the same or different elements.  If deployed systems
   instead use a common or related 'origid' for service elements in
   their network, the potential for discovering patterns through
   correlation of those calls exists.  This could allow a recipient of
   calls to, for instance, learn that a set of callers are using a
   particular service or coming through a common gateway.  It is
   expected that SHAKEN PASSporTs are shared only within an [RFC3324]
   trust domain and will be stripped before calls exit that trust
   domain, but this information still could be used by analytics on
   intermediary and terminating systems to reveal information that could
   include geographic location and even device-level information,
   depending on how the 'origid' is generated.

11.  IANA Considerations

11.1.  JSON Web Token claims

   This specification requests that the IANA add two new claims to the
   JSON Web Token Claims registry as defined in [RFC7519].

   Claim Name: "attest"

   Claim Description: Attestation level as defined in SHAKEN framework

   Change Controller: IESG

   Specification Document(s): [RFCThis]

   Claim Name: "origid"

   Claim Description: Originating Identifier as defined in SHAKEN
   framework

   Change Controller: IESG

   Specification Document(s): [RFCThis]

11.2.  PASSporT Types

   This specification requests that the IANA add a new entry to the
   Personal Assertion Token (PASSporT) Extensions registry for the type
   "shaken" which is specified in [RFCThis].
