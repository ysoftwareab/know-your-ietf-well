  MPEG-4 is a recent standard from ISO/IEC for the coding of natural  
  and synthetic audio-visual data.This document describes a payload  
  format for transporting MPEG-4 synchronised and multiplexed data  
   using RTP.  
   Several services provided by RTP are beneficial for MPEG-4 
   encoded and multiplexed data transport over the Internet. 
   Additionally, the use of RTP makes it possible to synchronize 
   MPEG-4 data with other real-time data types.

   1.   Introduction 
 
      The MPEG-4 standard (ISO/IEC 14496) can be represented in a 
      layered architecture, where three layers can be identified as 
      follows: 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
         media aware,  |           COMPRESSION LAYER:          | 
                       |     Elementary Streams (ES) encoding  | 
       delivery unaware|       MPEG-4 part 2 Visual            |

                       +---------------------------------------+ 
      ================================================ ESI Interface 
                       +---------------------------------------+

       delivery unaware|      Elementary streams management    | 
            layer      |         and synchronisation           | 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
       ================================================DAI Interface 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
       delivery aware, |          DELIVERY LAYER (DMIF)        | 
       media  unaware  |provides FLEXMULTIPLEXING of SL streams| 
            layer      |        and transparent access         | 
                       |      to the delivery technology       | 
                       +---------------------------------------+ 
      Although the Delivery Layer mostly focuses on the control plane 
      it also encompasses  multiplexing tools, called the Flexmux 
      tools, to multiplex MPEG-4 SL streams. MPEG makes a "constant  
      delivery delay" assumption: each MPEG-4 packet transmitted over  
      the network should have a nearly constant transmission delay.  
      Under this assumption, the reconstruction of the correct timing  
      of MPEG-4 bitstreams is supported similarly both by the MPEG-4  
      SL stream and by the MPEG-4 FlexMux stream syntaxes.  
       
      Different payload formats have been defined or are under  
      definition to carry some (or all) types of MPEG-4 Elementary  
      streams, to carry MPEG-4 SL streams, see [7], [14] & [15]. 
      This document will specify a RTP payload format to enable the 
      carriage of Flexmux streams. 
   2.   MPEG-4 overview 
  2.1.   Compresion layer: 
    
     The compressed content produced by this layer are the Elementary  
     Streams (ESs)that are organised in Access Units (AUs). An AU is 
     the smallest element to which timestamps can be assigned.  
      
     AUs are passed to the Synchronisation Layer (SL) together with 
     timestamps, RandomAccess, and other information through the ESI 
     interface.

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams         July 02  
     The Compression Layer processes the traditional individual 
     audio/visual elementary streams (ES) and some associated 
     'systems' elementary streams (ES) such as Bifs, OD, IPMP and 
     OCI elementary streams. 
    
     The MPEG-4 audio/visual ES syntaxes are defined in[3] and[2]. 
     The 'systems' ES syntaxes are described in [1]: the Bifs ES 
     syntax allows a dynamic scene description. The OD ES syntax 
     allows the description of the hierarchical relations, location 
     and properties of different ESs through a dynamic set of Object 
     Descriptors. The 'system' ES may require to be carried with a 
     better protection than the traditional audio/visual ESs. 
      
     The compression layer is unaware of a specific delivery 
     technology, but it can react to the characteristics of a  
     particular delivery layer such as the path-MTU or packet loss or  
     bit error characteristics. 
 
  2.2.      Synchronisation Layer: 
    
     The MPEG-4 SL stream syntax is defined in [1]. It provides a 
     unique and homogeneous encapsulation of any ES which is 
     organised in AUs. This the case of all the MPEG-4 ESs, but it can 
     also be the case of non MPEG-4 ESs. 
     That layer primarily provides the synchronisation between ESs. 
     Integer or fractional AUs, from the same ES, are encapsulated in  
     SL packets  that build an SL stream. 
      
     SL packets are passed to the Delivery Layer (DMIF) through the 
     DMIF Application Interface (DAI interface), which can allows 
     assigning  QoS requirements to the delivery of SL streams. 
      
     The synchronisation layer is unaware of a specific delivery 
     technology, but it can react to the characteristics of a  
     particular delivery layer such as the path-MTU or packet loss. 
    
    
  2.3.   The Delivery Layer & the Flexmultiplexing: 
    
     The MPEG-4 Delivery Layer consists of the Delivery Multimedia 
     Integration Framework defined in [4]. This layer is media 
     unaware but delivery technology aware. It provides transparent 
     access to and delivery of content irrespective of the 
     technologies used.  
      
     This interface supports content location independent protocols 
     firstly for establishing the MPEG-4 session and secondly for 
     accessing to transport channels. DMIF monitors transport 
     channels on the QoS requirements assigned to the SL streams, 
     and supports the Flexmultiplexing of the SL streams, by the means 
     of the MPEG-4 FlexMux tools. There are different possible FlexMux 
     tools. FlexMux streams delivery is defined in [4], while the

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams         July 02  
     FlexMux stream syntax is defined within [1]. 
        
     This draft specifies an RTP [5] payload format for transporting 
     multiplexed MPEG-4 encoded data streams. It can be presented as 
     an instance of the MPEG-4 Delivery layer. 
 
     The SL streams can be FlexMultiplexed into FlexMux streams. A  
     FlexMux stream is a succession of FlexMux packets. Each FlexMux  
     packet is built from a FlexMux packet header followed by a FlexMux  
     packet payload. The FlexMux packet payload consists in one or  
     several complete SL packets 
     The FlexMux packet header is composed of a  one byte index  
     followed by a length field. The index gives the FlexMux Channel 
     number. 
      
     A particular FlexMux Channel number (index=238) is reserved to 
     identify a particular "signalling" FlexMux channel. The Ù238ˆ 
     packets are dedicated to carry a FlexMux Clock Reference time 
     stamp (FCR) indicating its arrival time and the bitrate of the 
     FlexMux stream. FlexMux streams are piecewise constant  
     bit-streams.  
     A "238" packet can also carry, "in-band", the different FlexMux  
     descriptors: FlexMuxChannel, FlexMuxBufferSize, FlexMuxTiming,  
     FlexMuxCodeTable and FlexMuxIdent descriptors. 
      
     The FlexMux descriptors can also be provided by out-of-band means  
     (e.g. SDP). 
     2.3.1. Some of the advantages of FlexMultiplexing: 
    
      1. Since a typical MPEG-4 session may involve a large number of 
      objects, that may be as many as a few hundred, transporting 
      each ES as an individual RTP session may not always be 
      practical. The use of one session per elementary stream cannot 
      be much cost effective, both on the server side and on the 
      client side in terms of performance, when the number of 
      elementary streams will increase within a scene. 
    
      2. The use of one single session for a multiplexed bitstream 
      enables to send a bunch of ESs that are tightly synchronized 
      together. Some of these ESs can themselves be Bifs and OD 
      ESs when a scene description is used with Audio-Visual ES, 
      and some other ESs can be OCI ES, and even IPMP (or DRM) ES when 
      such systems are involved. 
 
      3. The FlexMultiplexing management supports concatenation of 
     multiple SL packets into one FlexMux packet, by the use of  
     FlexMuxCode table entries. 
    
      4. If the applied multiplexing policy is smoothing at the maximum  
     the multiplexed SL streams, mutual synchronization between these 
     SL streams can be easily preserved when packet losses occur. 
    
      5. The use of the FlexMux technology enables possible

      interconnection between Internet network and digital television 
      network, as MPEG normatively defines the use the MPEG-4 FlexMux 
      syntax to carry MPEG-4 over MPEG-2 transport channels[9]. 
    
      6. The reconstruction of the correct timing of the FlexMux 
      stream is possible, using timing samples (FCRs) carried within  
      the FlexMux signalling channel, if the "constant delivery delay"  
      assumption can be assumed. 
    
      7. The overall MPEG-4 receiver buffer size is reduced, as 
      MPEG-4 compliant Flexmultiplexed streams, by the use of the 
      MPEG-4 timestamps, respect the MPEG-4 system decoder model 
    
      8. The FlexMux  in-band signalling mechanism that allows to  
      signal dynamically, at anytime, within the stream itself, the 
      bit-rate of the stream (FlexMux streams have a piecewise constant 
      bit-rate), allowing to have an easy bandwidth management. FlexMux 
      descriptors and Ad Hoc descriptors are carried within this in-
      band signalling mechanism. 
 
      9. Protection can be enhanced by means of repetition of vital SL 
     packets. 
      
     10. Content providers are able to bundle together a single 
      stream with assurance that associated streams will be kept 
      together and synchronized. 
 
     2.3.2. Some of the disadvantages of FlexMultiplexing: 
    
      One disadvantage that can be seen with FlexMultiplexing is the 
      Flexmultiplexing policy itself, that brings more complexity to 
      the server side. 
    
      The major disadvantage with the packetization of the MPEG-4 
      Flexmultiplexed streams is the added packet header overhead. 
      In order to minimize the overhead, two FlexMux tools, with two  
      different FlexMux packet length fields are supported.  
    
      MPEG-4 does not support a reduction mechanism of the carried 
      MPEG-4 Flexmultiplexed streams packet headers. This issue needs 
      certainly be resolved using a mechanism similar to what was 
     proposed with [8]. 
 
   3.   applicability statement 
    
  3.1.   Environment of the payload format: 
    
     This payload format is dedicated to applications relying on an 
     MPEG-4 scene. The contents of a scene may vary completely from one 
     application to another application. A scene may be either quite 
     simple (description of a 2D layout, in the streaming case), or 
curet et al.             expires January 2003                 [Page 5]

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams         July 02  
     more complex (with 3D objects). A scene can be considered, on one 
     hand, as a monolithic and static declaration, as on the other 
     hand, it may be considered dynamicaly changing along with time.  
    
  3.2.   Restrictions REQUIRED on the contents: 
      
  Which Elementary streams to FlexMultiplex together?: 
       According to the DMIF principle of MPEG-4, Elementary streams 
       are FlexMuliplexed together when they require the same Quality 
       of Service over the network. As in general, the System 
       Elementary streams require a better protection (see next 
       paragraph on the handling of System Elementary streams), the 
       application may take advantage in FlexMultiplexing system 
       streams in a first FlexMux stream provided with a good 
       protection, while other "non system" streams will be 
       Flexmultiplexed within a second FlexMux stream provided with 
       less achieved protection. 
   Which time base? 
       When all the Elementary streams that build a scene are 
       associated with a common time base, the FlexMux clock reference 
       stream constitutes this common time base. When the network 
       jitter can be handled (the "constant delivery delay" assumption 
       verified), reconstruction of this common clock can be achieved, 
       on the receiving side. 
    
  3.3.   Handling of System Elementary streams: 
    
   Senders SHOULD ensure that packet loss does not cause severe 
   problems in application execution when the Elementary Streams carry 
   System Elementary streams such as programmatic content, DRM (or 
   IPMP), metadata information and "scene description" streams (OD 
   commands, BIFS commands). 
    
   MPEG-4 has introduced the "scene carousel mechanism" which supports 
   the possibility to dynamically change the "scene description" by 
   sending animation information (changes in parameters) and structural 
   change information (updates). This mechanism provides "scene 
   description" ESs with Random Access Points (RAPs). Like for key 
   frames for video, the periodicity of transmission of these RAPs 
   should be  suitabily adjusted depending on the application and the 
   network it is  deployed on. 
    
   Reliability can be improved by re-transmission, SL packet 
   duplication or by using the "scene description carousel" mechanism, 
   while observing the general congestion  control principles.  
    
   The application has to take into account the delays introduced by 
   these two methods. Contents have to be send sufficiently in advance. 
   The application can achieve synchronisation, at the receiver side, 
   by the means of the different timestamps (FCRs, DTSs, and CTSs).

   When such measures are deemed insufficiently adequate, instead of 
   this payload format applications SHOULD use more reliable means to 
   transport the information, for example by applying an FEC scheme for 
   RTP (such as in RFC 2733), or by using RTP over TCP (such as in RFC 
   2326), while still giving due consideration to congestion control.

   RFC 2354.

        i. Ability to synchronize MPEG-4 streams with other RTP 
           payloads 
    
        ii. Monitoring MPEG-4 delivery performance through RTCP 
    
        iii. Combining MPEG-4 and other real-time data streams 
             received from multiple end-systems into a set of 
             consolidated streams through RTP mixers

      Payload Type (PT): The assignment of a particular  RTP payload 
      type to this new packet format, is outside the scope of this 
      document, and is not specified here. If the dynamic payload 
      type assignment is used, it can be specified by some out of 
      band means (e.g. SDP, according to the syntax proposed in the 
      paragraph 9) that the MPEG-4 FlexMux payload format 
      is used for the corresponding RTP packets.  
    
      Marker (M) bit: The M bit is set to 1 to indicate that the RTP 
      packet payload includes the end of each Access Unit of which data 
      is contained in this RTP packet.  
      The M bit is set to 0 when the RTP packet contains one or more 
      Access Unit fragments that are not Access Unit ends.  
    
       
      Extension (X) bit: Defined by the RTP profile used. 
    
      Sequence Number: Increment by one for each RTP data packet sent. 
      It starts with a random initial value for security reasons. 
    
       
      Timestamp: 32 bits: it reflects the sampling instant of the  
      FlexMux packet corresponding to the RTP packet. The sampling  
      instant is given by the same clock that increments monotonically  
      and linearly as the one which is used to validate the FCR field  
      in the "238" specific FlexMux channel. Unless specified by an out  
      Of band means (e.g. SDP), the resolution of the timestamp is set 
      to its default value(90KHz).

      applied to an RTP packet for data that would be sent at the 
      instant the SR packet is being generated and sent. 
      The NTP timestamp value is the NPT time at which that SR packet 
      is sent.  
    
    
  6.3.   The RTP packet payload 
    
      The RTP packet payload is built from an integer number of 
      complete FlexMux packets, defined in [1]. 
      Each FlexMux packet is built from a FlexMux packet header  
      followed by a FlexMux packet payload. The FlexMux packet header  
     is composed of a one byte index followed by a length field. The  
     length field can be on one byte (when the"first" FlexMux tool is  
     used) or on several bytes (when the "second" FlexMux tool is  
     used). The index identifies the FlexMux packet in the FlexMux  
     stream.  
    
 
   7.   Fragmentation rules 
 
      MPEG-4 Access Units (AUs) are the smallest entity to which MPEG-4  
      is assigning temporal references. AUs are embedded within SL  
     packets, and the SL packets embedded within FlexMux packets.  
 
      Some MPEG-4 codecs define optional syntax for Access Units sub- 
      entities (AU parts) that are independently decodable for error  
      resilience purposes. In that mode the maximum size of the AU  
      parts depends on the path-MTU size, taking care of the SL and  
     FlexMux packet headers'overhead. 
 
     As no fragmentation occur at the FlexMux level, this section on  
      fragmentation rules is only a concern for the compression  Layer  
      (when producing the AUs or the AU sub_entities that are  
      independantly decodable -the AU parts) and the SL layer (when  
      performing Access Unit -or AU part- fragmentation into SL  
      packets), in order to prevent media decoding difficulties at the  
     receiver side. 
    
      A FlexMux packet contains one or several SL packets. If the first  
     FlexMux tool is used, SL packets MUST be less than 255 bytes long. 
     If the second FlexMux tool is used, this length is limited to 268  
     Mbytes.  
    
      The size of the FlexMux packets should be adjusted such that 
      the resulting RTP packet (embedding one or several FlexMux 
      packets) is not larger than the path-MTU. 
   
8.  Transport of MPEG-4 FlexMux streams 
    
      An MPEG-4 FlexMux packet is mapped directly onto the RTP 
curet et al.             expires January 2003                 [Page 9]

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams         July 02  
      payload without any addition of extra header fields or removal 
      of any FlexMux packet header syntactic elements. 
    
      There are packetization restrictions due to the fact that no 
      synchronization pattern is part of the FlexMux packet header: 
      An RTP packet should contain an integer number of complete  
      FlexMux packets.   
      An RTP packet payload should start with the start of a FlexMux 
      packet. An RTP packet payload should end with the end of a 
      FlexMux packet. 
    
      Each RTP packet will contain a timestamp derived from the 
      sender's clock reference, synchronized to the FlexMux Clock.  
      That timestamp represents the sampling instant of the  
      first byte of the RTP packet. The sampling instant is given by  
      the same clock as the one used to validate the FCR field in the  
      FlexMux stream. 
       
      Special consideration is to be given to the transport of FlexMux 
      packets that carry the FCR samples. Such FlexMx packets have an  
      index ==238. When such a "238" FlexMux packet is transported 
      within a RTP packet, it is always the first FlexMux packet of  
      that RTP packet. The direct comparison between the FCR sample and 
      the RTP time stamp allows the receiver to know the exact  
      relationship between these two time stamps, when the RTP  
      timestamp is randomly chosen. 
    
      The FCRs, as well as the CTSs and the DTSs embedded within a  
     FlexMux stream are samples of the same common clock. The  
     relationship between the different CTSs and DTSs and the FCRs are  
     defined according to the constraints of the MPEG-4 system decoder  
     model). 
     As the DTSs and CTSs embedded within a FlexMux stream are avail 
     able at the application level (through the ESI interface, above  
     the SL layer), synchronisation with other media can be achieved at  
     the application level. 
   
     When the "constant delivery delay" assumption can be assumed  
      (handling, after estimation, of the network  jitter) the FCR  
     samples may be used, on the receiver side to accurately  
     reconstruct the original sender∆s FlexMux clock.  
    
     On the receiving side, the RTP packet timestamp will not be passed  
     to the MPEG-4 Flexdemultiplexor. 
    
      The FlexMux descriptors (declaration descriptor, timing 
      descriptor, Channel Table descriptor, codetable entry 
      descriptor, buffersize descriptor,etc..) describing the  
      characteristics of the FlexMux stream may be provided by out 
      of band means (e.g. SDP), and (or) by the inband signalling  
      mechanism supported by the FlexMux stream syntax [1]. 
      Ad Hoc (non MPEG) descriptors are also supported. 
    
      When the IP packet marking facility is needed, as it is  based on 
      the 'degradationPriority' field present in each SL packet, all

Internet Draft  RTP payload for MPEG-4 FlexMux streams         July 02  
      the FlexMux packets grouped in the same RTP packet should contain 
      SL packets where the 'degradationPriority' field should be filled 
      with the same value.  
 
      Protection mechanisms for FlexMux streams within RTP packets 
      are outside of the scope of this specification. 
 
9.   SDP syntax 
    
     It is assumed that one typical way to signal the FlexMux streams 
     characteristics of this payload format is via a SDP message that 
     may be transported to the client in reply to a RTSP [11] DESCRIBE 
     command, or via SAP [12].  
     The SDP protocol is decribed in [10]. 
      
  9.1.   Types and Names  
        
      This section describes the MIME types and names associated with 
      this payload format. This section is intended for registration 
      with IANA [13].  
        
 
     9.1.1.   MIME type registration  
     
      MIME media type name:  "video" or "audio" or "application"  
        
      "video" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Visual streams (i.e. video as  
      defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2 [2] and/or graphics as defined in 
      ISO/IEC 14496-1 [1]) or MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey 
      information needed for an audio/visual presentation.  
        
      "audio" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Audio streams (ISO/IEC 14496-3) 
      or MPEG-4 Systems streams that convey information needed for an 
      audio only presentation.  
        
      "application" SHOULD be used for MPEG-4 Systems streams  
      (ISO/IEC14496-1) like MPEG-4 FlexMux streams that serve other 
      purposes than only an audio/visual presentation.   
       
      The payload names used in an RTPMAP attribute within SDP, to 
      specify the mapping of payload number to its definition, also 
      come from the MIME namespace.  Each of the RTP payload mappings 
      defined above has a distinct name.  It is recommended that 
      visual streams be identified under 'video', and audio streams 
      be identified under 'audio', and otherwise 'application' be 
      used. 
    
      When a FLexMux stream is served (e.g. over HTTP) or otherwise 
      must be identified by a MIME type, the type 'application/mpeg4- 
      flexmux' SHALL be used.  These files consist of concatenated 
      FLexMux packets in transmission order.

      <payload>     is the dynamic payload number. 
      mpeg4-flexmux indicates the encoding type of the media, one  
                    MPEG-4 FlexMux stream.  
    
      <time scale> is the time scale of the RTP time stamps. 
    
      <parameters> is a way to  specialise  <name>. 
       
      The MPEG-4 FlexMux descriptors related to FlexMux description  
      are defined within [1]. The list of MPEG-4 descriptors cannot be 
      empty. Ad Hoc descriptors can complete it.   
       
      Other SDP attributes should, if used, carry values consistent 
      with those carried in MPEG-4 systems (for example, bit rate). 
     9.1.3.   the a=fmtp keyword: 
 
   The FlexMux descriptors can be defined in the fmtp attribute. Under 
   a base 64 encoding and under a textual syntax described hereafter. 
    
   a = fmtp :<format> info= <fmxInfodescr>;fmxident=...;fmxtiming=... ; 
   fmxfmctable=...;fmxbuffersize=... ;fmxcodetablentry=     
    
   info= <fmxInfodescr> 
    
   <fmxInfodescr> is a base-64 encoding of the all the descriptors 
   related to this FlexMux stream. This is a concatenation of various 
   FlexMux related descriptors. Each FlexMux related descriptor is 
   described within [1] by its tag followed by its length and its 
   parameters.

10.      RTSP usage: 
    
      
     The RTSP protocol is described in [11]. 
      When RTSP is used as a session-control protocol, RTP SHOULD be 
      used as the transport protocol. 
       
      The initial DESCRIBE format SHOULD be SDP.  If the SDP 
      information reveals that an IOD is needed, and the terminal 
      does not already have it, then a second DESCRIBE accepting an  
      IOD SHOULD be performed. 
       
      Note that if an MPEG-4 FlexMux stream is closed (TEARDOWN) then 
      the RTSP session ID will be lost.  The next (re-)opened FlexMux 
      stream will supply a new session ID. New DESCRIBEs may be 
      needed. 
    
11.      Security Considerations 
    
    
      RTP packets transporting information with the proposed payload 
      format are subject to the security considerations discussed in 
      the RTP specification [5]. This implies that confidentiality of 
      the media streams is achieved by encryption.  
    
      If the entire stream (extension data and AU data) is to be 
      secured and all the participants are expected to have the keys 
      to decode the entire stream, then the encryption is performed  
      in the usual manner, and there is no conflict between the two 
      operations (encapsulation and encryption). 
    
      The need for a portion of stream (e.g. extension data) to be 
      encrypted with a different key, or not to be encrypted, would 
      require application level signalling protocols to be aware of  
      the usage of the XT field, and to exchange keys and negotiate  
      their usage on the media and extension data separately.
