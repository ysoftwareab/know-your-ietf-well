Abstract


   There is a clear need to provide and deploy interoperable calendaring
   and scheduling services for the Internet. Current group scheduling
   and Personal Information Management (PIM) products are being extended
   for use across the Internet, today, in proprietary ways. This
   document has been defined to provide the a definition of a common
   format for openly exchanging calendaring and scheduling information
   across the Internet.

   This memo is formatted as a registration for a MIME media type per
   [RFC 2048]. However, the format in this memo is equally applicable
   for use outside of a MIME message content type.

   The proposed media type value is 'TEXT/CALENDAR'. This string would
   label a media type containing calendaring and scheduling information
   encoded as text characters formatted in a manner outlined below.

   This MIME media type provides a standard content type for capturing
   calendar event and to-do information. It also can be used to convey
   free/busy time information. The content type is suitable as a MIME
   message entity that can be transferred over MIME based email systems
   or using HTTP. In addition, the content type is useful as an object
   for interactions between desktop applications using the operating
   system clipboard, drag/drop or file systems capabilities.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   This document is based on the earlier work of the vCalendar
   specification for the exchange of personal calendaring and scheduling
   information. In order to avoid confusion with this referenced work,
   this document is to be known as the iCalendar specification. This
   document is based on the calendaring and scheduling model defined in
   [ICMS]. The document is also the basis for the calendaring and
   scheduling interoperability protocol defined in [ITIP-1], [ITIP-2]
   and [ITIP-3].

   This document also includes the format for defining content type
   profiles. A content type profile is a document that defines a set of
   usage constraints for the iCalendar object. For example, a profile
   might be defined to specify how the iCalendar object can be used to
   provide for a set of interpersonal scheduling messages. Such a
   profile might define scheduling messages that request an event be
   scheduled, reply to an event request, send a cancellation notice for
   an event, modify or replace the definition of an event, provide a
   counter proposal for an original event request, delegate an event
   request to another individual, request free or busy time, reply to a
   free or busy time request, or provide similar scheduling messages for
   a to-do or journal entry calendar component.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997



1.      Introduction


   The use of calendaring and scheduling has grown considerably in the
   last decade. Enterprise and inter-enterprise business has become
   dependent on rapid scheduling of events and actions using this
   information technology. However, the longer term growth of
   calendaring and scheduling, is currently limited by the lack of
   Internet standards for the message content types that are central to
   these groupware applications. This specification is intended to
   progress the level of interoperability possible between dissimilar
   calendaring and scheduling applications. This specification defines a
   MIME content type for exchanging electronic calendaring and
   scheduling information. The Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core
   Object Specification, or iCalendar, allows for the capture and
   exchange of information normally stored within a calendaring and
   scheduling application; such as a Personal Information Manager or a
   Group Scheduling product.

   The calendaring and scheduling model implemented by this
   specification is defined in the [ICMS].

   The format is suitable as an exchange format between applications or
   systems. The format is defined in terms of a MIME content type. This
   will enable the object to be exchanged using several transports,
   including but not limited to SMTP, HTTP, a file system, desktop
   interactive protocols such as the use of a memory-based clipboard or
   drag/drop interactions, point-to-point asynchronous communication,
   wired-network transport, or some form of unwired transport such as
   infrared might also be used.

   The definition of a calendaring and scheduling interoperability
   protocol is the subject of another specification [ITIP-1], [ITIP-2]
   and [ITIP-3].

   The specification also provides for the definition of usage profiles
   that will map this content type to a set of messages for supporting
   calendaring and scheduling operations such as requesting, replying
   to, modifying, and canceling meetings or appointments, to-dos and
   journal entries. The usage profiles can be used to define other
   calendaring and scheduling operations such a requesting for and
   replying with free/busy time data.

   The specification also includes a formal grammar for the content type
   to aid in the implementation of parsers and to serve as the
   definitive reference when ambiguities or questions arise in
   interpreting the descriptive prose definition of the specification.

2.      Basic Grammar and Conventions


   This document makes use of both a descriptive prose and a more formal
   notation for defining the calendaring and scheduling format.

   The notation used in this document is the augmented BNF notation of
   [RFC 822]. Readers intending on implementing this format defined in

Dawson/Stenerson                   5               Expires January 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   this document should be familiar with this notation in order to
   properly interpret the specifications of this document.

   All numeric and hexadecimal values used in this document are given in
   decimal notation. All names of properties, property parameters,
   enumerated property values and property parameter values are case-
   insensitive. However, all other property values are case-sensitive,
   unless otherwise stated.

        Note: All indented editorial notes, such as this one, are
        intended to provide the reader with additional information that
        is not essential to the building of a conformant implementation
        of the specifications of this document. The information is
        provided to highlight a particular feature or characteristic of
        the specifications.

   The format for the iCalendar object is based on the syntax of the
   [MIME DIR] content type. While the iCalendar object is not a profile
   of the [MIME DIR] content type, it does reuse a number of the
   elements from the [MIME DIR] specification.

3.      Definitions


   EDITORS' NOTE: This section may be removed if this text is added to
   the [ICSM].

   Date and time, as well as, calendaring and scheduling terminology are
   used in every day conversations. However, there are precise
   definitions of many of these terms that are used by this memo.

3.1     Alarm


   Also called a reminder. An activity that is an asynchronous mechanism
   for providing feedback for a pending or past event or to-do.

3.2     Busy Time


   A period of time on a calendar where there is already scheduled one
   or more events or that is otherwise not available for scheduling.

3.3     Calendar Component


   One of a number of entities that may be found within a calendar
   object. In particular, a calendar may be composed of calendar
   properties and event, to-do, journal, free/busy, time zone or alarm
   calendar components. Calendar components are identified by unique
   delimiters within a calendar object. Calendar components provide an
   organized collection of component properties.

3.4     Calendar Date


   A particular day of a calendar year identified by its position within
   the year.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

3.5     Calendar Object


   An entity consisting of an organized collection of calendar
   properties and calendar components. The calendar object is identified
   by unique delimiters.

3.6     Calendar Properties


   Attributes that apply to the calendar object as a whole. For example,
   the iCalendar version used to format the calendar object, an
   identifier of the product that created the calendar object, the
   calendar scale used to represent the calendar information and time
   zone information.

3.7     Calendar Scale


   The particular type of calendar in general use. For example,
   Gregorian, Buddhist Era, Japanese Emperor Era, Chinese Lunar,
   Islamic, and Jewish Calendars.

3.8     Component Properties


   Attributes that can only appear within one or more calendar
   components. For example, the due date can only appear within a to-do
   calendar component. The start date and time applies to both the event
   and the to-do component.

3.9     Coordinate Universal Time (UTC)


   The time scale maintained by the Bureau International de l’Heure
   (International Time Bureau) that forms the basis of a coordinated
   dissemination of standard frequencies and time signals. UTC is often
   incorrectly referred to as GMT.

3.10    Daylight Saving Time (DST)


   An adjustment to local to accommodate annual changes in the number of
   daylight hours. DST is also known as Advanced Time, Summer Time, or
   Legal Time. Daylight saving time adjustments in the southern
   hemisphere are opposite to those in the northern hemisphere.

3.11    Event


   A calendar component that defines a scheduled activity, minimally
   specified by a start and end calendar date and time of day and a
   description.

3.12    Free Time


   A period of time available on a calendar.






Dawson/Stenerson                   7               Expires January 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

3.13    Gregorian Calendar


   A calendar scale in general use beginning in 1582. It was introduced
   to correct an error in the Julian Calendar scale. The Gregorian
   Calendar scale is based on a solar calendar consisting of common
   years made up of 365 days and leap years made up of 366 days; both
   divided into 12 sequential months.

        Note: Initially, this memo addresses specification of calendar
        information in terms of the Gregorian calendar scale.

3.14    Journal


   A calendar component that defines a collection of information
   intended for human presentation and is minimally specified by a
   calendar date and one or more descriptions.

3.15    Local Time


   The clock time in public use in a locale. Local time is often
   referenced by the customary name for the time zone in which it is
   located. The relationship between local time and UTC is based on the
   offset that is in use for a particular time zone. In general, the
   formula is as follows:

        local time = UTC + (offset)

3.16    Period


   A duration of time, specified as either a defined length of time or
   by its beginning and end points.

3.17    Recurrence Rule


   A notation used to represent repeating occurrences, or the exceptions
   to such a repetition of an event or a to-do. The recurrence rule can
   also be used in the specification of a time zone description. This
   document defines a particular notation used in recurrence rules
   within this specification.

3.18    Reminder


   See Alarm.

3.19    Repeating Event or To-do


   An event or to-do that repeats for one or more additional
   occurrences. The recurrence may be defined with discrete dates and
   times and/or with a recurrence rule.

3.20    Standard Time


   Introduced by Sir Sanford Fleming and others around 1870, standard
   time is a scheme for dividing the world into zones where the same
   time would be kept. The original proposal was to divide the world

Dawson/Stenerson                   8               Expires January 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   into 24 zones, each zone having a width of 15 degrees of longitude.
   The center zone was originally the meridian passing through
   Greenwich, England, called Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The time in the
   zones was decremented by one hour per zone going westwards and was
   incremented by one hour per zone going eastwards from GMT. Changes
   have been made to the original proposal to accommodate political
   boundaries. In addition, some countries and regions specify 30 or 45
   minute offsets, rather than the full 60 minute offset. Standard time
   is also known as Winter Time in some regions.

   GMT and UTC are generally equivalent. However, by international
   agreement, the GMT term is discouraged in favor of the term UTC for
   all general time keeping.

3.21    Time Zone


   The particular time zone that time in a particular location is
   expressed in. A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time
   measurement rules determined by the governing body for the given
   location. These rules describe at a minimum the base offset from UTC,
   often referred to as the Standard Time offset. Optionally, if
   Daylight Savings Time is observed, the rules will specify the
   Daylight Savings Time offset and either a set of rules describing the
   transition to and from Daylight Savings Time or absolute dates
   describing the movement in and out of Daylight Savings Time. It is
   important to note that these rules are not static. Time zones may
   also have a local customary name. However, not all time zones have a
   special name for their time. The customary names for time zones are
   often abbreviated. However, not all time zone abbreviations are
   unique. For example, AST may mean Atlantic Standard Time, Alaska
   Standard Time, and even Aleutian Standard Time. Each of these are
   different offsets from UTC. Nevertheless, customary names for time
   zones are in use in various parts of the world.

3.22    To-do


   A calendar component that defines an action item and is minimally
   specified by an effective calendar date and time of day, a due
   calendar date and time of day, a priority and a description.

4.      TEXT/CALENDAR Registration Information


   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification is intended
   for use as a MIME content type. However, the implementation of the
   specification is in no way limited solely as a MIME content type.

   The following text is intended to register this specification as the
   MIME content type "text/calendar".

     To: ietf-types@uninett.no

     Subject: Registration of MIME content type text/calendar.

     MIME media type name: text

     MIME subtype name: calendar

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

     Required parameters: profile

     The "profile" parameter is used to convey the scheduling usage to
     which the calendaring and scheduling information pertains. It also
     is an identifier for the set of properties that the iCalendar
     object will consist of. The parameter is intended to be used as a
     guide to applications interpreting the information contained within
     the body part. It should NOT be used to exclude or require
     particular pieces of information unless the identified profile
     definition specifically calls for this behavior. Unless
     specifically forbidden by a particular profile definition, a
     text/calendar content type may contain any set of properties
     permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object
     Specification.

     The value for the "profile" parameter is defined as follows:

        profile = component "-" usage

        component       = "EVENT" / "event" / "TODO" / "todo"
                        / "JOURNAL" / "journal" / "FREEBUSY"
                        / "freebusy" / x-token  / iana-comp

        usage   = "REQUEST" / "request" / "REPLY" / "reply"
                / "CANCEL" / "cancel" / x-token / iana-usage

        x-token = <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with
                   no intervening white space, by any atom, where
                   atom is from section 3.3 of [RFC 822]>

        iana-comp = <A publicly defined extension component,
                     registered with IANA, as specified by this
                     document>

        iana-usage = <A publicly defined extension usage,
                      registered with IANA, as specified by this
                      document>

     Optional parameters: charset

     The "charset" parameter is defined in [RFC 2046] for other body
     parts. It is used to identify the default character set used within
     the body part.

     Optional content header fields: Any header fields defined by [RFC
     2045].

     Encoding considerations: This MIME content type can contain 8bit
     characters, so the use of quoted-printable or base64 MIME content-
     transfer-encodings may be necessary when iCalendar objects are
     transferrred across protocols restricted to the 7bit repertoire.
     Note that each property in the content entity may also have an
     inline encoding for the body part as a whole (i.e., inline encoding
     is performed first, then Content-Transfer-Encoding is applied to
     the entire body part). This means that content values may end up
     encoded twice.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

     Security considerations: The calendaring and scheduling information
     based on this MIME content type may include references to Uniform
     Resource Locators that may be programmed resources. In addition,
     this information may contain direct references to executable
     programs intended to be used as procedure-based alarms for an event
     or to-do. Implementers and users of this specification should be
     aware of the network security implications of accepting and parsing
     such information. In addition, the security considerations observed
     by implementations of electronic mail systems should be followed
     for this specification.

     Interoperability considerations: This MIME content type is intended
     to provide interoperability between calendaring and scheduling
     products. It is heavily based on the earlier [VCAL] industry
     specification.

5.      iCalendar Object Specification


   The following sections define the details of a Calendaring and
   Scheduling Core Object Specification. This information is intended to
   be an integral part of the MIME content type registration. In
   addition, this information may be used independent of such content
   registration. In particular, this specification has direct
   applicability for use as a calendaring and scheduling exchange format

5.1     Syntax Considerations


   The content information associated with an iCalendar object is
   formatted using a syntax similar to that defined by [MIME DIR]. That
   is, the content information consists of one or more CRLF-separated
   lines in the following format:

     contentline = name [";" paramlist] ":" value CRLF
     ;Folding permitted on content lines.

5.1.1   Content Lines


   Individual lines within the iCalendar object are delimited by a line
   break, which is a CRLF sequence (ASCII decimal 13, followed by ASCII
   decimal 10). Line should not be longer than 76 characters, excluding
   the line break.

   Long lines of text can be split into a multiple-line representations
   using a line "folding" technique. That is, a long line may be split
   at any point by inserting a CRLF immediately followed by a single
   LWSP character (i.e., SPACE, ASCII decimal 32 or HTAB, ASCII decimal
   9). Any sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single LWSP
   character is ignored (i.e., removed) when processing the content
   type.

   For example the line:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   Can be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description
       that exists on a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
   to its single line representation is called "unfolding". Unfolding is
   accomplished by removing the CRLF character and the LWSP character
   that immediately follows.

   An intentional formatted text line break in a property value must
   also be specified by a (RFC 822) line break, which is a CRLF
   sequence. However, since the CRLF sequence is used to delimit a line,
   property values with imbedded formatted line breaks (i.e., hard line
   breaks) must be encoded using an alternate encoding of either the "Q"
   or "B" encodings, as defined in [RFC 2047]. These encodings are used
   directly and without any of the additional syntax elements of [RFC
   2047] encoded-words.

   Since neither the "Q" nor the "B" encodings ever produce LWSP
   characters (note that the "Q" encoding turns spaces into
   underscores), or CRLF character sequences as output, LWSP characters
   and CRLF character sequences can be freely inserted into encoded
   material at any point to fold encoded field values. All LWSP
   characters and CRLF character sequences should be ignored when


Dawson/Stenerson                   13              Expires January 1998

   decoding an encoded field value. The "Q" encoding of multiple lines
   of formatted text are separated with a Q CRLF sequence of "=0D=0A".
   The length restrictions [RFC 2047] imposes on encoded-words do not
   apply in this context, but fields encoded with the "Q" or "B"
   encodings must be folded into lines of no longer than 76 characters.

   For example a multiple line DESCRIPTION property value of:

        Project XYZ Final Review
        Conference Room - 3B
        Come Prepared.

   Could be represented in "Q" encoding as:

   DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=Q:Project_XYZ
    _Final_Review=0D=0A
    Conference_Room_-_3B=0D=0A
    Come_Prepared.

   And in the "B" encoding as:

   DESCRIPTION;ENCODING=UHJvamVjdCBYWVogRmluYWw
    gUmV2aWV3DQpDb25mZXJIbm NIIFJvb20gLSAzQg0KQ29tZ
    SBQcmVwYXJIZC4NCg = =

5.1.2   List and Field Separators


   Where a property parameter value consists of a list of values, each
   value must be separated by a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). A
   COMMA character in a property parameter value must be escaped with a
   BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Structured property values must have their components separated by a
   SEMICOLON character (ASCII decimal 59). In addition, lists of
   property parameters must be separated by a SEMICOLON character (ASCII
   decimal 59). A SEMICOLON character in a property value or property
   parameter value must be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (ASCII
   decimal 92).

   For example, in the following properties a SEMICOLON is used to
   separate property parameters and property value fields. A COMMA is
   used to separate values.

     ATTENDEE;RSVP=TRUE;ROLE=ATTENDEE:"J.Smith" <jsmith@host.com)
     RDATE;VALUE=DATE:19970304,19970504,19970704,19970904

5.1.3   Multiple Values


   Each attribute or property defined in the iCalendar object may have
   multiple values, if allowed in the definition of the specific
   property. The general rule for encoding multi-valued items is to
   simply create a new content line for each value; including the
   property name. However, it should be noted that some properties
   support encoding multiple values in a single property by separating
   the values with a COMMA (ASCII decimal 44).

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

5.1.4   Character Set


   The default character set is [UTF-8]. For transport in a MIME entity,
   the "charset" Content-Type parameter may be used to set the default
   character set for the entire MIME body part.

5.1.5   Language


   The "language" property parameter should be used to identify data in
   alternate languages. The default language is "us-EN". The value of
   the language property parameter is that defined in [RFC 1766].

        Note: For transport in a MIME entity, the Content-Language
        header field may be used to set the default language for the
        entire body part.

5.1.6   Content Encoding


   The "encoding" property parameter should be used to specify an
   alternate encoding for a value. If the value contains a <CR>
   character (ASCII decimal 10) or <LF> character (ASCII decimal 13), it
   must be encoded using either "Q" or "B" encoding, since <CR><LF> is
   used to separate lines in the iCalendar object itself.

5.1.7   Binary Content


   There is no support for inline encoding of binary information in an
   iCalendar object. Binary information is associated with the iCalendar
   object through the use of a uniform resource locator (URL) reference
   to the binary information.

5.1.8   Recurrence Set


   Recurring events and to-dos are supported by this specification. The
   recurrence within the iCalendar object may be specified as either a
   list of discrete date and time values or as a recurrence rule. The
   full recurrence set is generated by considering the initial DTSTART
   along with the RRULE, RDATE, EXDATE and EXRULE properties contained
   within the iCalendar object. The DTSTART defines the first instance
   in the recurrence set. Multiple instances of the RRULE and EXRULE
   properties may also be specified to define more sophisticated
   recurrence sets. The final recurrence set is generated by gathering
   all of the start date-times generated by any of the specified RRULE
   and RDATE properties, and excluding any start date and times which
   fall within the union of start date and times generated by any
   specified EXRULE and EXDATE properties. This implies that start date
   and times within exclusion related properties (i.e., EXDATE and
   EXRULE) take precedence over those specified by inclusion properties
   (i.e., RDATE and RRULE). Where duplicate instances are generated by
   the RRULE and RDATE specification, only one recurrence is considered.
   Duplicate instances are ignored.

   The recurrence rule used in the iCalendar object is defined in the
   RRULE component property.

5.1.9   Data Types


   The "value" property parameter is an optional property parameter. It
   is used to identify the data type and format of the property value.
   The values of a given instance of a property must only be of a single
   data type. For example, a RDATE property can not have a combination
   of DATE-TIME and TIME values. The following data types are used by
   the iCalendar object.

5.1.9.1 Boolean


   The "boolean" data type is used to identify properties that contain
   either a "true" or a "false" boolean value. These values are case
   insensitive. The data type is defined by the following notation:

     boolean    = "TRUE" / "FALSE"

   For example, any of the following are equivalent:

     TRUE
     true
     TrUe

5.1.9.2 Calendar User Address


   The "cal-address" data type is used to identify properties that
   contain an address of a calendar user. The phrase component of the
   address may be used to match an unknown address with an otherwise
   known individual, group, or resource. The data type is as defined by
   the following notation:

     cal-address        = addr-spec / [phrase] "<" addr-spec ">"

     addr-spec  = local-part "@" domain         ;RFC 822 style address
     local-part = WORD *("." WORD)
     domain     = domain-ref *("." domain-ref)
     domain-ref = ATOM

     phrase     = 1*WORD
     WORD       = ATOM / quoted-string
     quoted-string = <"> *(qtext/quoted-pair) <"> ; Regular qtext or
                                                  ;   quoted chars.
     qtext      = <any CHAR excepting <">,        ; => may be folded
                  "\" & CR, and including linear-white-space>
     quoted-pair ="\" CHAR                        ; may quote any char
     CHAR       = <any a character from the selected character set>
     ATOM       = 1*<any CHAR except specials, SPACE and CTLs>

5.1.9.3 Date


   The "date" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   calendar date. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete
   representation, basic format for a calendar date. The text format
   specifies a four-digit year, two-digit month, and two-digit day of
   the month. There are no separator characters between the year, month

   and day component text. The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     date-fullyear      = 4DIGIT
     date-month         = 2DIGIT        ;01-12
     date-mday          = 2DIGIT        ;01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31
                                        ;based on month/year

     date               = date-fullyear date-month date-mday

   For example, the following represents July 14, 1997:

     19970714

5.1.9.4 Date-Time


   The "date-time" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise calendar date and time of day. The format is expressed as the
   [ISO 8601] complete representation, basic format for a calendar date
   and time of day. The text format is a concatenation of the "date",
   followed by the LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (ASCII decimal 84)
   time designator, followed by the "time" format defined above. The
   data type is defined by the following notation:

     date-time  = date "T" time ;As specified above in date and time

   The following represents July 14, 1997, at 1:30 PM in UTC and the
   equivalent time in New York (five hours behind UTC), expressed as a
   local time and local time with UTC offset:

     19970714T133000Z
     19970714T083000
     19970714T083000-0500

5.1.9.5 Duration


   The "duration" data type is used to identify properties that contain
   a duration of time. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] basic
   format for the duration of time. The format can represent durations
   in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The
   data type is defined by the following notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     dur-second = 1*DIGIT "S"
     dur-minute = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-second]
     dur-hour   = 1*DIGIT "H" [dur-minute]
     dur-time   = "T" (dur-hour / dur-minute / dur-second)

     dur-week   = 1*DIGIT "W"
     dur-day    = 1*DIGIT "D"
     dur-month  = 1*DIGIT "M" [dur-day]
     dur-year   = 1*DIGIT "Y" [dur-month]
     dur-date   = (dur-day / dur-month / dur-year) [dur-time]

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

     duration   = "P" (dur-date / dur-time / dur-week)

   For example, a duration of 10 years, 3 months, 15 days, 5 hours, 30
   minutes and 20 seconds would be:

     P10Y3M15DT5H30M20S

5.1.9.6 Float


   The "float" data type is used to identify properties that contain a
   real value number value. If the property permits, multiple "float"
   values may be specified using a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separator character. The data type is defined by the following
   notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     float      = ["+" / "-"] *DIGIT ["." *DIGIT]

   For example:

     1000000.0000001
     1.333
     -3.14

5.1.9.7 Integer


   The "integer" data type is used to identify properties that contain a
   signed integer value. The valid range for "integer" is -2147483648 to
   2147483647. If the sign is not specified, then the value is assumed
   to be positive. If the property permits, multiple "integer" values
   may be specified using a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44) separator
   character. The data type is defined by the following notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     integer    = ["+" / "-"] *DIGIT

   For example:

     1234567890
     -1234567890
     +1234567890
     432109876

5.1.9.8 Period of Time


   The "period" data type is used to identify values that contain a
   precise period of time. There are two forms of a period of time.

   A period of time may be identified by it start and its end. This
   format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete representation, basic
   format for "date-time" start of the period, followed by a SOLIDUS
   character (ASCII decimal 47), followed by the "date-time" of the end
   of the period. For example, the period starting at 10 AM in Seattle


Dawson/Stenerson                   18              Expires January 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   (eight hours behind UTC) on January 1, 1997 and ending at 11 PM in
   Seattle on January 1, 1997 would be:

     19970101T100000-0800/19970101T230000-0800

   A period of time may also be defined by a start and a duration of
   time. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete
   representation, basic format for the "date-time" start of the period,
   followed by a SOLIDUS character (ASCII decimal 47), followed by the
   [ISO 8601] basic format for "duration" of the period. For example,
   the period start at 10 AM in Seattle (eight hours behind UTC) on
   January 1, 1997 and lasting 5 hours and 30 minutes would be:

     19970101T100000-0800/P5H30M

   The data type is defined by the following notation:

     period-explicit = date-time "/" date-time
     ;ISO 8601 complete representation basic format for a period of time
     ;consisting of a start and end. The start must be before the end.

     period-start = date-time "/" duration
     ;ISO 8601 complete representation basic format for a period of time
     ;consisting of a start and duration of time.

     period     = period-explicit / period-start

5.1.9.9 Text


   The "text" data type is used to identify values that contain human
   readable text. The character set and language in which the text is
   represented is controlled by the charset and language property
   parameters. The data type is defined by the following notation:

     CHAR       = <Any character in the selected character set>

5.1.9.10        Time


   The "time" data type is used to identify values that contain a time
   of day. The format is expressed as the [ISO 8601] complete
   representation, basic format for a time of day. The text format
   consists of a two-digit 24-hour of the day (i.e., values 0-23), two-
   digit minute in the hour (i.e., values 0-59), and two-digit seconds
   in the minute (i.e., values 0-59). If seconds of the minute are not
   supported by an implementation, then a value of "00" should be
   specified for the seconds component. Fractions of an hour, minute or
   second are not supported by this format. This format is used to
   represent local time, local time with UTC offset and UTC time. UTC
   time is identified by a LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z suffix character
   (ASCII decimal 90), the UTC designator, appended to the time. The
   local time with UTC offset is expressed as a local time, suffixed
   with the signed offset from UTC. The UTC offset is express as the 2-
   digit hours and 2-digit minutes difference from UTC. It is expressed
   as positive, with an optional leading PLUS SIGN character (ASCII
   decimal 43), if the local time is ahead of UTC. It is expressed as a
   negative, with a leading HYPEN-MINUS character (ASCII decimal 45), if

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   the local time is behind UTC. Local time has neither the UTC
   designator nor the UTC offset suffix text. The data type is defined
   by the following notation:

     DIGIT      =<any ASCII decimal digit>      ;0-9

     time-hour          = 2DIGIT        ;00-23
     time-minute        = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
     time-second        = 2DIGIT        ;00-59
     time-numzone       = ("+" / "-") time-hour time-minute
     time-zone          = "Z" / time-numzone

     time               = time-hour time-minute time-second [time-zone]

   For example, the following represents 8:30 AM in New York, five hours
   behind UTC, in local time and local time with UTC offset. In
   addition, 1:30 PM in UTC is illustrated:

     083000
     083000-0500
     133000Z

   There are cases when a floating time is intended within a property
   value. For example, an event may be defined that indicates that an
   individual will be busy from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day. In these
   cases, a local time may be specified. The recipient of an iCalendar
   object with a property value consisting of a local time, without any
   relative time zone information, should interpret the value as being
   fixed to the recipient's locale and time zone. In most cases, a fixed
   time is desired. To properly communicate a fixed time in a property
   value, either UTC, local time with UTC offset, or local time with a
   time zone calendar component must be specified.

5.1.9.11        URL


   The "url" data type is used to identify values that contain a uniform
   resource locator (URL) type of reference to the property value. This
   data type might be used to reference binary information, for values
   that are large, or otherwise undesirable to include directly in the
   iCalendar object.

   The URL value formats in RFC 1738, RFC 2111 and any other IETF
   registered value format may be specified.

   The data type is defined by the following notation:

     url        = <As defined by any IETF RFC>

   Any IANA registered URL type may be used. These include, but are not
   limited to, those for FTP and HTTP protocols, file access, content
   identifier and message identifier.

   For example, the following is an URL for a local file:

5.1.9.12        UTC Offset


   The "utc -offset" data type is used to identify properties that
   contain an offset from UTC to local time. The data type is defined by
   the following notation:

     utc-offset = time-numzone  ;As defined above in time data type

   For example, the following are UTC offsets for New York (five hours
   behind UTC) and Geneva (one hour ahead of UTC):

     -0500      ;New York
     +0100      ;Geneva

5.2     iCalendar Object


   The Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object is a collection of
   calendaring and scheduling information. Typically, this information
   will consist of a single iCalendar object. However, multiple
   iCalendar objects may be sequentially, grouped together. The first
   line and last line of the iCalendar object must contain a pair of
   iCalendar object delimiter strings. The syntax for an iCalendar
   object is as follows:

     icalobject = "BEGIN" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF
                  icalbody
                  "END" ":" "VCALENDAR" CRLF [icalobject]

   The following is a simple example of an iCalendar object:

     BEGIN:VCALENDAR
     VERSION:2.0
     PRODID:-//hacksw/handcal//NONSGML v1.0//EN
     BEGIN:VEVENT
     DTSTART:19970714T120000-0500
     DTEND:19970714T235959-0500
     DESCRIPTION:Bastille Day Party
     END:VEVENT
     END:VCALENDAR

5.3     Property


   A property is the definition of an individual attribute describing a
   calendar property or a calendar component. A property takes the
   following form:

     property   = propname [";" parmlist] ":" value CRLF

     propname   = <any properties defined in this document>
                / iana-prop / x-token

     x-token    = <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with no
                   intervening white space, by any atom>

     iana-prop  = <A publicly defined extension property, registered
                   with IANA, as specified by this document>

   The following is an example of a property:

     DTSTART:19960415T083000-05:00

   This document places no imposed ordering of properties within an
   iCalendar object.

   Property names, parameter names and parameter values (i.e.,
   everything to the left of the ":" on a line) are case insensitive.
   For example, the property name "DUE" is the same as "due" and "Due".

5.4     Calendar Components


   The body of the iCalendar object consists of a sequence of calendar
   properties and one or more calendar components. The calendar
   properties are attributes that apply to the calendar as a whole. The
   calendar components are collections of properties that with a
   particular calendar semantic. For example, the calendar component may
   specify a an event, a to-do, journal entry, time zone information, or
   free/busy time information, or alarm.

   The body of the iCalenar Object is defined by the following notation:

     icalbody   = calprops 1*component

     calprops   = [calscale] prodid [profile] [profile-version]
                  [source] [name] version

     component  = 1*(eventc / todoc / journalc / freebusyc /
                / timezonec)

5.4.1   Event Component


   An Event Calendar Component is a grouping of component properties and
   an optional alarm calendar component that represent a scheduled
   amount of time on a calendar. For example, it may be an activity;
   such as a one-hour, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM,
   tomorrow.

   An Event Component is defined by the following notation:

     eventc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF
                  *eventprop *alarmc
                  "END" ":" "VEVENT" CRLF

     eventprop  = *attach *attendee *categories [class] [created]
                  description [dtend] dtstart *exdate *exrule
                  [geo] *last-mod [location] [priority] [rstatus]
                  *related *resources *rdate *rrule dtstamp
                  [resp-seq] [seq] [status] [summary] [transp]
                  uid *url [recurid] *(comment)

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   The Event Component can not be nested within another Calendar
   Component. Event components may be related to each other or to a To-
   do or Journal Calendar Component with the RELATED-TO property.

   The following is an example of the Event Calendar Component:

     BEGIN:VEVENT
     DTSTART:19970903T083000-0800
     DTEND:19970903T110000-0800
     DESCRIPTION:Annual Employee Review
     CLASS:PRIVATE
     CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
     END:VEVENT

5.4.2   To-do Component


   A To-do Calendar Component is a grouping of component properties and
   an optional alarm calendar component that represent an action-item or
   assignment. For example, it may be an item of work assigned to an
   individual; such as "turn in travel expense today".

   A To-do Component is defined by the following notation:

     todoc      = "BEGIN" ":" "VTODO" CRLF
                  *todoprop *alarmc
                  "END" ":" "VTODO" CRLF

     todoprop   = *attach *attendee *categories [class] [completed]
                  [created] description dtstamp dtstart due *exdate
                  *exrule [geo] *last-mod [location] priority [rstatus]
                  *related *resources *rdate *rrule [resp-seq] [recurid]
                  [seq] [status] [summary] [transp] uid *url *(comment)

   The To-do Component can not be nested within another Calendar
   Component. If To-do components need to be related to each other or to
   an Event or Journal Calendar Component, they can specify a
   relationship with the RELATED-TO property.

   The following is an example of a To-do Calendar Component:

     BEGIN:VTODO
     DTSTART:19970415T083000-0500
     DUE:19970415T235959-0500

     END:VEVENT

5.4.3   Journal Component


   A Journal Calendar Component is a grouping of component properties
   that represent one or more descriptive text on a particular calendar
   date. For example, it may be a journal entry of individual telephone

   contacts for the day or an ordered list of accomplishments for the
   day.

   A Journal Component is defined by the following notation:

     journalc   = "BEGIN" ":" "VJOURNAL" CRLF
                  *jourprop
                  "END" ":" "VJOURNAL" CRLF

     jourprop   = *attach *attendee *categories [class] [created]
                  description dtstart dtstamp *last-mod *related
                  [rdate] [rrule] [rstatus] [resp-seq] [seq] uid *url
                  [recurid] *(comment)

   The Journal Component can not be nested within another Calendar
   Component. If Journal Components need to be related to each other or
   to an Event or To-Do Calendar Component, they can specify a
   relationship with the RELATED-TO property.

   The following is an example of the Journal Calendar Component:

     BEGIN:VJOURNAL
     DTSTART:19970317T083000
     DESCRIPTION:1. Staff meeting: Participants include Joe, Lisa
      and Bob. Aurora project plans were reviewed. There is currently
      no budget reserves for this project. Lisa will escalate to
      management. Next meeting on Tuesday.
      2. Telephone Conference: ABC Corp. sales representative called
      to discuss new printer. Promised to get us a demo by Friday.
      3. Henry Miller (Handsoff Insurance): Car was totaled by tree.
      Is looking into a loaner car. 654-2323 (tel).
     END:VJOURNAL

5.4.4   Free/Busy Component


   A Free/Busy Calendar Component is a grouping of component properties
   that represent free or busy time information. Typically, this
   component exists in an iCalendar object that is being used to either
   request or return free or busy time information.

   A Free/Busy Component is defined by the following notation:

     freebusyc  = "BEGIN" ":" "VFREEBUSY" CRLF
                  *fbprop
                  "END" ":" "VFREEBUSY" CRLF

     fbprop     = *attendee [created] [duration] [dtend] [dtstart]
                  dtstamp #freebusy *last-mod *related [rstatus]
                  [resp-seq] [seq] uid *url *(comment)

   The Free/Busy Component can not be nested within another Calendar
   Component. Free/Busy components may be related to each other with the
   RELATED-TO property. Multiple Free/Busy Calendar Components may be
   specified within a iCalendar object. This permits the grouping of
   Free/Busy information into logical collections, such as monthly
   groups of busy time information.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   The Free/Busy Calendar Component is intended for use in profiles
   involving requests for free time, requests for busy time, requests
   for both free and busy, and the associated replies.

   Free/Busy information can be expressed using the FREEBBUSY property.
   This property provides a terse representation of time periods. One or
   more FREEBUSY properties may be specified in the FREE/BUSY Calendar
   Component to describe the Free/Busy information.

   Optionally, the DTSTART and DTEND properties may be specified to
   express the start and end date and time for Free/Busy information in
   the Free/Busy Calendar Component. When present in a Free/Busy
   Calendar Component, they should be specified prior to any FREEBUSY
   properties. In a free time request, these properties may be used in
   combination with the DURATION property to express a request for a
   duration of free time within a given window of time.

   The recurrence properties (RRULE, EXRULE, RDATE, EXDATE) are not
   permitted within a Free/Busy Calendar Component. Any recurring events
   are resolved into their individual busy time periods using the
   FREEBUSY property.

   The following is an example of a Free/Busy Calendar Component:

     BEGIN:VFREEBUSY
     DTSTART:19971015T050000Z
     DTEND:19971016T050000Z
     FREEBUSY;VALUE=PERIOD-START:19971015T050000Z/PT8H30M,
      19971015T160000Z/PT5H30M, 19971015T223000Z/PT6H30M
     END:VFREEBUSY

5.4.5   Alarm Component


   An Alarm Calendar Component is a grouping of component properties
   that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a to-do. The Alarm
   Calendar Component may only be specified in an event or to-do
   calendar component. For example, it may define a reminder for a
   pending event or an overdue to-do.

   The DTSTART property specifies the calendar date and time of day that
   the alarm will be triggered. The value may alternately be set to a
   period of time, before or after the event or to-do, that the alarm
   will be triggered.

   An Alarm Component is defined by the following notation:

     alarmc     = "BEGIN" ":" "VALARM" CRLF
                  *alarmprop
                  "END" ":" "VALARM" CRLF

     alarmprop  = *attach [created] [description] dtstart duration
                / *last-mod *related repeat [summary] *(comment)

   The Alarm Component can only appear within either an Event or To-Do
   Calendar Component. Alarm Components can not be nested.

5.4.6   Timezone Component


   A time zone is unambiguously defined by the set of time measurement
   rules determined by the governing body for a given geographic area.
   These rules describe at a minimum the base offset from UTC for the
   time zone, often referred to as the Standard Time offset. Many
   locations adjust their Standard Time forward or backward by one hour,
   in order to accommodate seasonal changes in number of daylight hours,
   often referred to as Daylight Saving Time. Some locations adjust
   their time by a fraction of an hour. Standard Time is also known as
   Winter Time. Daylight Saving Time is also known as Advanced Time,
   Summer Time, or Legal Time in certain countries. The following table
   shows the changes in time zone rules for the eastern United States.

     1987-*     first Sun in Apr, 02:00 -0400    EDT

   Interoperability between two calendaring and scheduling applications,
   especially for recurring events and to-dos, is dependent on the
   ability to capture and convey date and time information in an
   unambiguous format. The specification of current time zone
   information is integral to this behavior.

   The Time Zone Calendar Component is a grouping of component
   properties that define a time zone description. The time zone
   description specifies the effective Standard Time or Daylight Savings
   Time rules for a particular time zone. The Timezone Component can not
   be nested within other Calendar Components. The Time Zone Component
   may be specified multiple times. If the Time Zone Component is
   missing, the recipient should assume all local times are relative to
   the recipient's time zone. The Time Zone Component should be
   specified in the iCalendar object before any other Calendar
   Components.

   A Time Zone Component is defined by the following notation:

     timezonec  = "BEGIN" ":" "VTIMEZONE" CRLF
                  *tzprop
                  "END" ":" "VTIMEZONE" CRLF

     tzprop     = [created] [daylight] dtstart [rdate / rrule]
                  [tzname] tzoffset *(comment)

   The Time Zone component is important for correct interpretation of
   individual as well as recurring calendar components that span a time
   zone transition. For example, from EST to EDT.  The exception to this
   are calendar components that are considered floating (i.e., occurs at
   a particular local time no matter what time zone you are in). If the
   iCalendar object contains a non-floating calendar component that has
   a recurring date pattern (i.e., includes the RRULE property) or a
   list of date and local time values (i.e., includes the RDATE
   property), one or more Time Zone components must be specified, such
   that for the given range of the recurrence (i.e., the earliest
   instance to latest instance), there is valid time zone information
   for all instances. In other words, if all of the instances of the
   pattern is entirely within one offset observance, (e.g., all are in
   Standard Time), only one Time Zone Calendar Component need be
   present. If a time zone transition is crossed, then other Time Zone
   Components are needed. Further, if there are known changes to the
   rules for the time zone, even more Time Zone Components are needed.

   Each Time Zone Component consists of several properties:

   The CREATED property is a DATE-TIME value that indicates when the
   time zone description was created.

   The DAYLIGHT property is a BOOLEAN value indicating Standard Time
   (FALSE) or Daylight Savings Time (TRUE). The default for DAYLIGHT is
   FALSE or Standard Time.

   The DTSTART property in this usage is a fully specified DATE-TIME
   value, including the UTC offset, indicating the effective start date
   and time for the time zone information. For example, 19671029T020000-
   0400 represents the time at which the transition to Standard Time
   took effect in 1967 for the eastern United States.

   The TZOFFSET property is a UTC-OFFSET value indicating the UTC offset
   for the time zone (Standard Time or Daylight Savings Time).

   The TZNAME property is the customary name for the time zone.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   The RRULE property is a TEXT property indicating the recurrence rule
   for the transition to this time zone. For example, in the United
   States, the transition from Standard Time to Daylight Saving Time
   occurs on the first Sunday in April at 02:00. If a recurrence rule
   describing the transition is known to have an effective end date, the
   UNTIL recurrence rule parameter is used to specify that end date and
   time. If the recurrence rule for a particular observance (Daylight
   Saving Time) is changing, then the UNTIL of the first rule will be
   equal to the DTSTART for the replacement rule. See example below.

   Alternatively, the RDATE property can be used. The RDATE property is
   a DATE-TIME property indicating the individual dates and times that
   the transition takes effect. The values supplied for RDATE for each
   Time Zone component must provide valid time zone information of all
   instances of the recurrence specified for the calendar component to
   which this time zone information is to be applied.

   The following are examples of the Time Zone Calendar Component:

   This is a simple example showing time zone information for the
   Eastern United States using RDATE. Note that this is only suitable
   for a recurring event that starts on or later than 1997, April 6, at
   02:00:00 EST (i.e., the earliest effective transition date and time)
   and ends no later than 1998, April 7, 02:00:00 EST (i.e., latest
   valid date and time for EST in this scenario).  For example, this can
   be used for a recurring event that ocurrs every Friday, 8am-9am,
   starting June 1, 1997, ending Dec 31, 1997.

     BEGIN:VTIMEZONE
     DAYLIGHT:FALSE
     RDATE:19971026T020000-0400
     TZOFFSET:-0500

     RDATE:19970406T020000-0500
     TZOFFSET:-0400
     TZNAME:EDT
     END:VTIMEZONE

   This is a simple example showing the current time zone rules for the
   Eastern United States using a RRULE recurrence pattern. Note that
   there is no effective end date to either of the Standard Time or
   Daylight Time rules. This information would be valid for a
   recurrening event starting today and continuing on into the known
   future.

5.5     Calendar Properties


   The Calendar Properties are attributes that apply to the iCalendar
   object, as a whole. These properties do not appear within a Calendar
   Component. They should be specified after the BEGIN:VCALENDAR
   properties and prior to any Calendar Component.

5.5.1   Calendar Scale


   This property is identified by the property name CALSCALE. This
   property defines the calendar scale used for the calendar information
   specified in the iCalendar object. This specification is based on the
   Gregorian calendar scale. The Gregorian calendar scale is assumed if
   this property is not specified in the iCalendar object. It is
   expected that other calendar scales will be defined in other
   specifications or by future versions of this specification.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     calscale   = "CALSCALE" ":" calvalue CRLF

     calvalue   = "GREGORIAN" / iana-scale

     iana-scale = <Any other designator for a calendar scale
                   registered with IANA>

   The following is an example of this property:

     CALSCALE:GREGORIAN

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.5.2   Product Identifier


   This property is identified by the property name PRODID. This
   property specifies the identifier for the product that created the
   iCalendar object. The vendor of the implementation should assure that
   this is a globally unique identifier; using some technique such as an
   ISO 9070 FPI value. This calendar property must be specified in the
   iCalendar object but can only appear once.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     prodid     = "prodid" ":" pidvalue CRLF

     pidvalue   = text
     ;Any text that describes the product and version
     ;and that is generally assured of being unique.

   The following is an example of this property:

     PRODID:-//ABC Corporation//NONSGML My Product//EN

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.5.3   Profile


   This property is identified by the property name PROFILE. This
   property defines the usage profile associated with the calendar
   object. When used in a MIME message entity, the value of this
   property must be the same as the Content-Type profile parameter
   value. This property can only appear once within the iCalendar
   object.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     profile    = "PROFILE" ": profvalue CRLF

     profvalue  = " component "-" action

     component  = "EVENT" / "TODO" / "JOURNAL" / "FREEBUSY"
                / iana-component / x-token

     action     = <Any IANA registered iCalendar action type.>

     x-token    = <The two characters "X-" or "x-" followed, with no
                   intervening white space, by any atom>

     iana-component = <Any other component registered with IANA>

   The following is an example of this property when the iCalendar
   object is used to request a meeting:

     PROFILE:EVENT-REQUEST

   In the event that this property is not specified, the usage profile
   is undefined. The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.5.4   Profile Version


   This property is identified by the property name PROFILE-VERSION.
   This property specifies the identifier corresponding to the highest
   version number or the minimum and maximum range of the usage profile
   that was used in constructing the iCalendar object. Values for this
   property are to be defined by registering an iCalendar usage
   profiles.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     prof-version = "PROFILE-VERSION" ":" profvalue CRLF

     profvalue  = iana-prfver

     iana-prfver = max-prfver / (min-prfver ";" max-prfver)

     min-prfver = <A IANA registered iCalendar profile identifier>

     max-prfver = <A IANA registered iCalendar profile identifier>

   The following is an example of this property:

     PROFILE-VERSION:IPCS-1.0

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.5.5   Source


   This property is identified by the property name SOURCE. This
   property is defined by the [MIME DIR] specification. In this
   specification, the property identifies the URL for the source of the
   iCalendar object. The URL is useful for accessing the iCalendar
   object using a calendar access protocol.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     source     = "SOURCE" ":" url CRLF

   The following are examples of this property:

     SOURCE:http://xyz.corp.com/corp-cals/1997-events.or4

     SOURCE:http://xyz.corp.com/calendars/~jdoe

   The data type for this property is URL.

5.5.6   Source Name


   This property is identified by the property name NAME. This property
   is defined by the [MIME DIR] specification. The property identifies
   the displayable, presentation name for the source of the iCalendar
   object. The source name is a useful text to associate in the user-
   interface of an application with the value in the SOURCE property.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     name       = "NAME" ":" text CRLF

   The following is an example of this property:

     NAME:1997 Events Calendar for XYZ Corporation

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.5.7   Version


   This property is identified by the property name VERSION. This
   property specifies the identifier corresponding to the highest
   version number or the minimum and maximum range of the MIME
   Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type specification supported by
   the implementation that created the iCalendar object. A value of
   "2.0" corresponds to this specification. This calendar property must
   appear within the iCalendar object but can only appear once.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     version    = "VERSION" ":" vervalue CRLF

     vervalue   = "2.0"         ;This specification
                / maxver
                / (minver ";" maxver)

     minver     = <A IANA registered iCalendar profile identifier>
     ;Minimum iCalendar version used to create the iCalendar object

     maxver     = <A IANA registered iCalendar profile identifier>
     ;Maximum iCalendar version used to create the iCalendar object

   The following is an example of this property:

     VERSION:2.0

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.6     Component Properties


   The following properties apply to either an event or to-do calendar
   object component.

5.6.1   Attachment


   This property is identified by the property name ATTACH. The property
   provides the capability to associate an external object with a
   calendar component. For example, a document to be reviewed at a
   scheduled event or the description of the process steps for a to-do.
   The property may only be specified within event, to-do, or journal
   calendar components. This property may be specified multiple times
   within an iCalendar object.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     attach     = "ATTACH" ":" url CRLF

   The following are examples of this property:

     ATTACH:CID:jsmith.part3.960817T083000.xyzMail@host1.com

     ATTACH:FTP://xyzCorp.com/pub/reports/r-960812.ps

   The data type for this property is URL.

5.6.2   Attendee


   This property is identified by the property name ATTENDEE. The
   property defines an attendee within a calendar component. The
   property may only be specified within the event, to-do and free/busy
   calendar components.

   The property has the property parameters TYPE, for the type of
   attendee, ROLE, for the intended role of the attendee; STATUS, for
   the status of the attendee’s participation; RSVP, for indicating
   whether the favor of a reply is requested; EXPECT, to indicate the
   expectation of the attendee’s participation by the originator;
   MEMBER, to indicate the group that the attendee belongs to;

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   DELEGATED-TO, to indicate the person that the original request was
   delegated to; and DELEGATED-FROM, to indicated whom the request was
   delegated from.

   A recipient delegated a request MUST inherit the RSVP and EXPECT
   values from the attendee that delegated the request to them.

   Multiple attendees may be specified by including multiple ATTENDEE
   properties within the MIME calendaring entity.

   The property data type default is CAL-ADDRESS. The property data type
   may also be set to URL. This provides a useful mechanism to allow
   more than just the address of the attendee to be referenced. For
   example, the property value may refer to a URL.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     attendee   = "ATTENDEE" [";" attparamlist] ":"
                  (cal-address / URL) CRLF
     ;Value must match default or explicit data type

     attparamlist       = attparam / attparamlist ";" attparam
                        / paramlist / paramlist ";" attparam
                        / paramlist ";" attparamlist ";"
                          attparam

5.6.3   Categories


   This property is identified by the property name CATEGORIES. This
   property defines the categories for a calendar component. The
   property may be specified within the event, to-do or journal calendar
   component with an arbitrary text value. The property may also be
   specified within the alarm property with a value of the alarm
   category. More than one category may be specified as a list of
   categories separated by the COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44).

   The properties is defined by the following notation:

     categories = "CATEGORIES" [";" paramlist] ":"
                  catvalue CRLF

     catvalue   = cat1value *["," cat1value]
                / cat2value *["," cat2value]

     cat1value  = "APPOINTMENT" / "BUSINESS" / "EDUCATION" / "HOLIDAY"
                / "MEETING" / "MISCELLANEOUS" / "NON-WORKING HOURS"
                / "NOT IN OFFICE" / "PERSONAL" / "PHONE CALL"
                / "SICK DAY" / "SPECIAL OCCASION" / "TRAVEL"
                / "VACATION" / word
     ;Used in event and to-do components only

     cat2value  = "AUDIO" / "DISPLAY" / "EMAIL" / "PROCEDURE"
                / x-token / iana-word
     ;Used in alarm component only

   The following are examples of this property in an event, to-do or
   journal calendar component:

     CATEGORIES:APPOINTMENT,EDUCATION

     CATEGORIES:MEETING

   The following are examples of this property in an alarm calendar
   component:

     CATEGORIES:AUDIO,DISPLAY

     CATEGORIES:PROCEDURE

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.6.4   Classification


   This property is identified by the property name CLASS. This property
   defines the access classification for a calendar component. The
   property may only be specified in an event, to-do or journal calendar
   component. The property may only be specified once.

   An access classification is only one component of the general
   security system within a calendar application. It provides a method
   of capturing the scope of the access the calendar owner intends for
   information within an individual calendar entry. The access

Dawson/Stenerson                   36              Expires January 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   classification of an individual iCalendar component is useful when
   measured along with the other security components of a calendar
   system (e.g., user authorization, access rights, access role, etc.).
   Hence, the semantics of the individual access classifications can not
   be completely defined by this specification alone. Additionally, due
   to the "blind" nature of most exchange processes using this
   specification, these access classifications can not serve as an
   enforcement statement for a system receiving an iCalendar object .
   Rather, they provide a method for capturing the intention of the
   calendar owner for the access to the calendar component.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     class      = "CLASS" [";" paramlist] ":"
                  classvalue CRLF

     classvalue = "PUBLIC" / "PRIVATE" / "CONFIDENTIAL" / x-token
     ;Default is PUBLIC

   The following is an example of this property:

     CLASS:PUBLIC

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.6.5   Comment


   This property is identified by the property name COMMENT. This
   property specifies non-processing information intended to provide a
   comment to the calendar user. The property may be specified in any of
   the calendar components. The property may be specified multiple
   times.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     comment    = "COMMENT" ":" text CRLF

   The following is an example of this property:

     COMMENT:The meeting really needs to include both ourselves
      and the customer.  We can’t hold this  meeting without them.
      As a matter of fact, the venue for the meeting ought to be at
      their site. - - John

   The data type for this property is TEXT.

5.6.6   Date/Time Completed


   This property is identified by the property name COMPLETED. This
   property defines the date and time that a to-do was actually
   completed. The property may be specified once in a to-do component.
   The date and time is a UTC value.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     completed  = "COMPLETED" ":" date-time CRLF

   The data type for this property is DATE-TIME.

5.6.8   Date/Time Due


   This property is identified by the property name DUE. This property
   defines the date and time that a to-do is expected to be completed.
   The value must be later in time than the value for the DTSTART
   property. The time can either be in local time, local time with UTC
   offset or UTC time. The property must be specified in a to-do
   calendar component, but may only be specified once. The DUE value
   must be a date/time after the DTSTART value.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     due        = "DUE" ":" (date-time / duration) CRLF
     ;Value data type must match the value

   The following is an example of this property:

   with UTC offset or UTC time. The local time is only to be used to
   specify date and time values that do not need to be fixed. A
   recipient must assume their own time zone for data and time values
   that do not include time zone information. Events may have an end
   date/time but no start date/time. In that case, the event does not
   take up any time. The value must be later in time than the value of
   the DTSTART property.

   Within the free/busy calendar component, this property defines the
   end date and time for the free or busy time information. The time
   must be specified in local time with UTC offset or UTC time. The
   value must be later in time than the value of the DTSTART property.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     dtend      = "DTEND" ":" date-time CRLF

   The following is an example of this property:

     DTEND:19960401T235959Z

   The data type for this property is DATE-TIME.

5.6.10  Date/Time Stamp


   This property is identified by the property name DTSTAMP. This
   property specifies an UTC date/time stamp. The property indicates the
   date/time that the iCalendar object instance was created. This
   property SHOULD be included in every iCalendar object to permit the
   recipient to know when the iCalendar object was created.

   This property is different than the CREATED and LAST-MODIFIED
   properties. These two properties are used to specify when the
   calendar service information was created and last modified. This is
   different than when the iCalendar object representation of the
   calendar service information was created or last modified.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     dtstamp    = "DTSTAMP" ":" date-time CRLF

   The value type for this property is DATE-TIME. The value must be a
   UTC date/time value.

5.6.11  Date/Time Start


   This property is identified by the property name DTSTART. This
   property may be specified within the event, free/busy, and time zone
   calendar components.

   Within the event calendar component, this property defines the start
   date and time for the event. The property is required in event
   calendar components. The time can either be in local time, local time
   with UTC offset or UTC time. The local time is only to be used to
   specify date and time values that do not need to be fixed. A
   recipient must assume their own time zone for data and time values

   that do not include time zone information. Events may have a start
   date/time but no end date/time. In that case, the event does not take
   up any time.

   Within the free/busy calendar component, this property defines the
   start date and time for the free or busy time information. The time
   must be specified in local time with UTC offset or UTC time.

   Within the time zone calendar component, this property defines the
   effective start date and time for a time zone specification. This
   property is required within time zone calendar components. The time
   must be specified as a UTC time.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     dtstart    = "DTSTART" ":" (date-time / date) CRLF
     ;Date data type only permitted on Journal calendar component.

   The following is an example of this property:

     DTSTART:19960401T235959-0600

   The default data type for this property is DATE-TIME. For Journal
   calendar components, the data type may be overriden to be DATE.

   FREEBUSY properties within the Free/Busy Calendar Component should be
   sorted in ascending order, based on start time and then end time,
   with the earliest periods first.

   The FREEBUSY property may specify more than one value, separated by
   the COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44). In such cases, the FREEBUSY
   property values should all be of the same STATUS (e.g., all values of
   a particular STATUS listed together in a single property).

   The data type for this property is PERIOD.

5.6.18  Geographic Position


   This property is identified by the property name GEO. This property
   specifies information related to the global position for an event or
   to-do calendar component. The property value specifies latitude and
   longitude, in that order (i.e., "LAT LON" ordering). The longitude
   represents the location east and west of the prime meridian as a
   positive or negative real number, respectively. The latitude
   represents the location north and south of the equator as a positive
   or negative real number, respectively. The longitude and latitude
   values must be specified as decimal degrees and should be specified
   to six decimal places. This will allow for granularity within a meter
   of the geographical position. The simple formula for converting
   degrees-minutes-seconds into decimal degrees is:

     decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

5.6.19  Last Modified


   This property is identified by the property name LAST-MODIFIED. The
   property specifies the date and time that the calendar information
   was last revised. The property value may include multiple "date-time"
   values in order to capture the sequence of modifications made to the
   calendar information. This property may be specified in the event,
   to-do, journal or free/busy calendar components. The data and time
   must be a UTC value.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     last-mod   = "LAST-MODIFIED" ":" date-time ["," date-time]

   The data type for this property is DATE-TIME.

5.6.20  Location


   This property is identified by the property name LOCATION. The
   property defines the intended location for the event or to-do
   calendar component. The property may only be specified within an
   event or to-do calendar component.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     location   = "LOCATION [";" paramlist] ":" locavalue
                  CRLF

     locavalue  = text / url    ;The value must be the same type as the
                                ;default or explicit data type.

     LOCATION;VALUE=URL:http://www.xyzcorp.com/~jsmith.vcf

   The default data type for this property is TEXT. The data type may be
   reset to URL. In the case of the data type being URL, the property
   value may reference a vCard object. This provides a useful mechanism
   to specify a location in terms of its electronic business card.

5.6.21  Priority


   This property is identified by the property name PRIORITY. The
   property defines the priority for event or to-do. The property may
   only be specified within an event or to-do calendar component. The
   value is an integer. A value of zero (ASCII decimal 48) specifies an
   undefined priority. A value of one (ASCII decimal 49) is the highest
   priority. A value of two (ASCII decimal 50) is the second highest
   priority. Subsequent numbers specify a decreasing ordinal priority.

   The property is specified by the following notation:

     priority   = "PRIORITY" ":" integer CRLF
     ;Default is zero

   The following is an example of this property:

     PRIORITY:2

   The data type for this property is INTEGER.

5.6.22  Recurrence Date/Times


   This property is identified by the property name RDATE. This property
   defines the list of date/times for a recurring event, to-do or time
   zone calendar component. This property may appear along with the
   RRULE property to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences.
   When they both appear in an iCalendar object, the recurring events
   are defined by the union of occurrences defined by both the RDATE and
   RRULE. The times can either be in local time, local time with UTC
   offset or UTC based time. If local time is used, the TIMEZONE
   component must be included in the iCalendar object, otherwise the
   local time value will be interpreted relative to the time zone of the
   recipient. The period values for RDATE are specified using a specific
   start and a specific end basic format (period-explicit) or the period
   with a specific start and a specific duration basic format (period-
   start).

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     rdate      = "RDATE" ":" rdvalue *["," rdvalue] CRLF

     rdvalue    = date-time / period
     ;Value must match the default or explicit data type

   The default data type for this property is DATE-TIME. The value may
   be reset to DATE or PERIOD.

5.6.23  Recurrence ID


   This property is identified by the property name RECURRENCE-ID. This
   property identifies a specific instance of a recurring event, to-do
   or journal calendar component. The property value is the effective
   DTSTART value of the recurrence instance. The time of day component
   for the value must be either an UTC or a local time with UTC offset
   time format, unless the original calendar object was expressed as a
   ‘   ‘floating’             ’ calendar object; that is in local time with no timezone
   calendar component specified..

   The date/time value is set to the time when the original recurrence
   instance would occur - - meaning that if the intent is to change a
   Friday meeting to Thursday, the date/time is still set to the
   original Friday meeting.

   Recurrence ID is used in conjunction with the UID property to
   identify a particular instance of a recurring event, to-do or
   journal.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     recurid            = "RECURRENCE-ID" [";" rangeparm] ":" date-time

     rangeparm  = "RANGE" "=" ("THISANDPRIOR" / "THISANDFUTURE")

   The default value for the range parameter is the single recurrence
   instance only.

   The following are examples of this property:

     RECURRENCE-ID:19960401T235959Z

     RECURRENCE-ID;RANGE=THISANDFUTURE:19960120T120000Z

5.6.24  Recurrence Rule


   This property is identified by the property name RRULE. This property
   defines a rule or repeating pattern for a recurring events, to-dos,
   or time zone definitions. The property may be specified in the event,
   to-do, or time zone calendar components.

   The property value is a structured value consisting of a list of one
   or more recurrence grammar components. Each component is defined by a
   NAME=VALUE pair. The components are separated from each other by the
   SEMICOLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

   The FREQ component identifies the type of recurrence rule. This
   component must be specified in the recurrence rule. Valid values
   include HOURLY, to specify repeating events based on an interval of
   an hour or more; DAILY, to specify repeating events based on an
   interval of a day or more; WEEKLY, to specify repeating events based
   on an interval of a week or more; MONTHLY, to specify repeating
   events based on an interval of a month or more; and YEARLY, to
   specify repeating events based on an interval of a year or more.

   The INTERVAL component contains a positive integer representing how
   often the RRULE repeats. The default value is "1" or every hour for a
   HOURLY rule, every day for a DAILY rule, every week for a WEEKLY
   rule, every month for a MONTHLY rule and every year for a YEARLY
   rule. For a HOURLY rule, the value may also be expressed as a
   duration value, specifying hours and minutes for the repeat interval.
   For example, PT1H30M, would represent a 1 hour and 30 minute repeat
   interval.

   The UNTIL component defines a date-time value which bounds the RRULE.
   If not present, and the COUNT component is also not present, the
   RRULE is considered to repeat forever.

   The COUNT component defines the number of occurrences at which to
   bound the RRULE. This component is ignored if the UNTIL property
   parameter is also present.

   The BYDAY component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of days of the week; MO, indicates Monday; TU,
   indicates Tuesday; WE, indicates Wednesday; TH, indicates Thursday;
   FR, indicates Friday; SA, indicates Saturday; SU, indicates Sunday.

   Each of these values may also be preceded by a positive (+n) or
   negative (-n) integer. If present, this indicates the nth occurrence
   of the specific day within the MONTHLY or YEARLY RRULE. For example,
   within a MONTHLY rule, +1MO (or simply 1MO) represents the first
   Monday within the month, whereas -1MO represents the last Monday of
   the month.

   The BYMONTHDAY component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the month. Valid values are 1 to 31 or
   -31 to -1.

   The BYYEARDAY component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal
   44) separated list of days of the year. Valid values are 1 to 366 or
   -366 to -1. For example, -1 represents the last day of the year
   (December 31st).

   The BYSETPOS component specifies a COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44)
   separated list of values which corresponds to the nth occurrence
   within the set of events specified by the rule. Valid values are 1 to
   366 or -366 to -1. It must only be used in conjunction with another
   Byxxx component. For example "the last work day of the month" could
   be represented as:

     RRULE:BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1;FREQ=MONTHLY

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

   The BYWEEKNO component specifies a comma separated list of weeks of
   the year. Valid values are 1 to 52. This corresponds to weeks
   according to week numbering as defined in [ISO 8601]. That is, a week
   as "A seven day period within a calendar year, starting on a Monday
   and identified by its ordinal number within the year; the first
   calendar week of the year is the one that includes the first Thursday
   of that year." This property parameter is only valid for YEARLY
   rules.

   The BYMONTH component specifies a comma separated list of months of
   the year. Valid values are 1 to 12.

   The WKST property parameter specifies the day on which the workweek
   starts. Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA and SU. This is
   significant when a WEEKLY RRULE has an interval greater than 1. The
   default value is MO.

   If two different Byxxx components are specified within the RRULE, the
   recurrence occurrence must meet both criteria.

   If Byxxx component values are found which are beyond the available
   scope (ie, BYMONTHDAY=-30 in February), they are simply ignored. If a
   positive range limit is beyond the available scope, it will be
   interpreted as -1. Likewise, if a negative range limits beyond the
   available scope, it will be interpreted as +1.

   The RRULE property requires referencing the DTSTART, DTEND or
   DURATION properties in the iCalendar object to calculate the Event or
   To-do instances.

   The DTSTART and DTEND pair or DTSTART and DURATION pair, specified
   within the iCalendar object defines the first instance of the
   recurrence. When used with a recurrence rule, the DTSTART and DTEND
   properties must be specified in local time and the appropriate set of
   TIMEZONE components must be included. For detail on the usage of the
   TIMEZONE component, see the Time Zone Calendar Component definition.

   Any duration associated with the iCalendar object applies to all
   members of the generated recurrence. Any modified duration for
   specific recurrences would have to be explicitly specified using the
   RDATE property.

   This property is defined by the following notation:

     rrule      = "RRULE" [paramlist] ":" rvalue CRLF

5.6.25  Related To


   This property is identified by the property name RELATED-TO. The
   property is used to represent relationships or references between one
   calendar component and another. The property may only be specified in
   the event, to-do and journal calendar components. The property value
   consists of the persistent, globally unique identifier of another
   MIME calendar component. This value would be represented in a MIME
   calendar component by the UID property.

   A linked relationship can be specified by a series of components that
   each, in turn, refer to their parent component. A group relationship
   can be specified by a number of components that all refer to one
   common parent component.

   Changes to a calendar component referenced by this property may
   impact the related calendar component. For example, if a group event
   changes its start or end date or time, then the related, dependent
   events will need to have their start and end dates changed in a
   corresponding way. This property is intended only to provide
   information on the relationship of calendar components. It is up to
   the target calendar system to maintain any property implications of
   this relationship.

5.6.38  Non-standard Properties


   The MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type provides a "standard
   mechanism for doing non-standard things". This extension support is
   provided for implementers to "push the envelope" on the existing
   version of the specification. Extension properties are specified by
   property and/or property parameter names that have the prefix text of
   "X-" (the two character sequence: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER X character
   followed by the HYPEN-MINUS character). It is recommended that
   vendors concatenate onto this sentinel another short prefix text to
   identify the vendor. This will facilitate readability of the
   extensions and minimize possible collision of names between different
   vendors. User agents that support this content type are expected to
   be able to parse the extension properties and property parameters but
   may ignore them.

   The property is defined by the following notation:

     extension  = "X-" [vendorid] word [";" paramlist] ":"
                  value

     vendorid   = 1*char "-"    ;Vendor identification prefix text

   The following might be the ABC vendor’s extension for an audio-clip
   form of subject property:

     X-ABC-MMSUBJ;TYPE=WAVE; VALUE=URL: http://load.noise.org/mysubj.wav

   At present, there is no registration authority for names of extension
   properties and property parameters. The data type for this property
   is TEXT. Optionally, the data type may be any of the other valid data
   types.

6.      Recommended Practices


   These recommended practices should be followed in order to assure
   consistent handling of the following cases for an iCalendar object.

   1.      A calendar entry with a DTSTART but no DTEND - The event does not
     take up any time. It is intended to represent an event that is
     associated with a given calendar date and time of day, such as an
     anniversary. Since the event does not take up any time, it must

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

     not be used to record busy time no matter what the value for the
     TRANSP property.

   2.      A combination of RRULE and RDATE that produces more than one
     instance for a given date/time - Only one recurrence can occur on
     a given date/time interval. Just one instance for the date/time is
     recorded.

   3.      A particular calendar profile that specifies ATTENDEE properties
     with the MEMBER property parameter, for which the recipient has
     multiple memberships - Recipient should reply to only the first
     MEMBER value that it can match.

7.      Registration of Content Type Elements


   This section provide the process for registration of MIME Calendaring
   and Scheduling Content Type profiles and new or modified properties.

7.1     Registration of New and ModifiedProfiles


   New MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type profile types are
   registered by the publication of an IETF Request for Comment (RFC).
   Changes to a profile type are registered by the publication of a
   revision of the RFC defining the profile type.

7.2     Registration of New Properties


   This section defines procedures by which new properties or enumerated
   property values for the MIME Calendaring and Scheduling Content Type
   can be registered with the IANA. Note that non-IANA properties may be
   used by bilateral agreement, provided the associated properties names
   follow the "X-" convention.

   The procedures defined here are designed to allow public comment and
   review of new properties, while posing only a small impediment to the
   definition of new properties.

   Registration of a new property is accomplished by the following
   steps.

7.2.1   Define the property


   A property is defined by completing the following template.

     To: ietf-calendar@imc.org

     Subject: Registration of text/calendar MIME property XXX

     Property name:

     Property purpose:

     Property data type(s):

     Property encoding:


Dawson/Stenerson                   61              Expires January 1998


Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

     Property special notes (optional):

     Intended usage: (one of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)

   The meaning of each field in the template is as follows.

   Property name: The name of the property, as it will appear in the
   body of an text/calendar MIME Content-Type "property: value" line to
   the left of the colon ":".

   Property purpose: The purpose of the property (e.g., to indicate a
   delegate for the event or to-do, etc.). Give a short but clear
   description.

   Property data type(s): Any of the valid data types for the property
   value needs to be specified. The default data type also needs to be
   specified. If a new data type is specified, it needs to be declared
   in this section.

   Property encoding: The encodings permitted for the property value.
   This description must be precise and must not violate the general
   encoding rules defined in this document.

   Property special notes: Any special notes about the property, how it
   is to be used, etc.

7.2.2   Post the Property definition


   The property description must be posted to the new property
   discussion list, ietf-calendar@imc.org.

7.2.3   Allow a comment period


   Discussion on the new property must be allowed to take place on the
   list for a minimum of two weeks. Consensus must be reached on the
   property before proceeding to the next step.

7.2.4   Submit the property for approval


   Once the two-week comment period has elapsed, and the proposer is
   convinced consensus has been reached on the property, the
   registration application should be submitted to the Profile Reviewer
   for approval. The Profile Reviewer is appointed to the Application
   Area Directors and may either accept or reject the property
   registration. An accepted registration should be passed on by the
   Profile Reviewer to the IANA for inclusion in the official IANA
   profile registry. The registration may be rejected for any of the
   following reasons. 1) Insufficient comment period; 2) Consensus not
   reached; 3) Technical deficiencies raised on the list or elsewhere
   have not been addressed. The Profile Reviewer's decision to

   reject a property may be appealed by the proposer to the IESG, or the
   objections raised can be addressed by the proposer and the property
   resubmitted.

Internet Draft       C&S Core Object Specification        July 29, 1997

7.3     Property Change Control


   Existing properties may be changed using the same process by which
   they were registered.

        1.           Define the change

        2.           Post the change

        3.           Allow a comment period

        4.           Submit the property for approval

   Note that the original author or any other interested party may
   propose a change to an existing property, but that such changes
   should only be proposed when there are serious omissions or errors in
   the published specification. The Profile Reviewer may object to a
   change if it is not backwards compatible, but is not required to do
   so.

   Property definitions can never be deleted from the IANA registry, but
   properties which are no longer believed to be useful can be declared
   OBSOLETE by a change to their "intended use" field.

8.      File extension


   The file extension of "vcs" is to be used to designate a file
   containing calendaring and scheduling information consistent with
   this MIME content type.

9.      Macintosh File Type Code


   The file type code of "vcal" is to be used in Apple MacIntosh
   operating system environments to designate a file containing
   calendaring and scheduling information consistent with this MIME
   media type.
