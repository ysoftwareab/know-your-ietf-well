                   draft-reddy-dots-signal-channel-07

Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism that a DOTS client can use to
   signal that a network is under a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS)
   attack to an upstream DOTS server so that appropriate mitigation
   actions are undertaken (including, blackhole, drop, rate-limit, or
   add to watch list) on the suspect traffic.  The document specifies
   the DOTS signal channel including Happy Eyeballs considerations.  The
   specification of the DOTS data channel is elaborated in a companion
   document.

1.  Introduction

   A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make
   machines or network resources unavailable to their intended users.
   In most cases, sufficient scale can be achieved by compromising
   enough end-hosts and using those infected hosts to perpetrate and
   amplify the attack.  The victim in this attack can be an application
   server, a host, a router, a firewall, or an entire network.

   In many cases, it may not be possible for an enterprise network
   administrators to determine the causes of an attack, but instead just
   realize that certain resources seem to be under attack.  This
   document, which adheres to the DOTS architecture
   [I-D.ietf-dots-architecture], proposes that, in such cases, the DOTS
   client just inform its DOTS server(s) that the enterprise is under a
   potential attack and that the mitigator monitor traffic to the
   enterprise to mitigate any possible attacks.  This cooperation
   between DOTS agents contributes to ensure a highly automated network
   that is also robust, reliable and secure.

   Protocol requirements for DOTS signal channel are obtained from DOTS
   requirements [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements].

   This document satisfies all the use cases discussed in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases] except the Third-party DOTS notifications
   use case in Section 3.2.3 of [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases] which is an
   optional feature and not a core use case.  Third-party DOTS
   notifications are not part of the DOTS requirements document.
   Moreover, the DOTS architecture does not assess whether that use case
   may have an impact on the architecture itself and/or the DOTS trust
   model.

   This is a companion document to the DOTS data channel specification
   [I-D.reddy-dots-data-channel].

2.  Notational Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   (D)TLS: For brevity this term is used for statements that apply to
   both Transport Layer Security [RFC5246] and Datagram Transport Layer
   Security [RFC6347].  Specific terms will be used for any statement
   that applies to either protocol alone.

   The reader should be familiar with the terms defined in
   [I-D.ietf-dots-architecture].

3.  Solution Overview

   Network applications have finite resources like CPU cycles, number of
   processes or threads they can create and use, maximum number of
   simultaneous connections it can handle, limited resources of the
   control plane, etc.  When processing network traffic, such
   applications are supposed to use these resources to offer the
   intended task in the most efficient fashion.  However, an attacker
   may be able to prevent an application from performing its intended
   task by causing the application to exhaust the finite supply of a
   specific resource.

   TCP DDoS SYN-flood, for example, is a memory-exhaustion attack on the
   victim and ACK-flood is a CPU exhaustion attack on the victim
   ([RFC4987]).  Attacks on the link are carried out by sending enough
   traffic such that the link becomes excessively congested, and
   legitimate traffic suffers high packet loss.  Stateful firewalls can
   also be attacked by sending traffic that causes the firewall to hold
   excessive state and the firewall runs out of memory, and can no
   longer instantiate the state required to pass legitimate flows.
   Other possible DDoS attacks are discussed in [RFC4732].

   In each of the cases described above, the possible arrangements
   between the DOTS client and DOTS server to mitigate the attack are
   discussed in [I-D.ietf-dots-use-cases].  An example of network
   diagram showing a deployment of these elements is shown in Figure 1.
   Architectural relationships between involved DOTS agents is explained
   in [I-D.ietf-dots-architecture].  In this example, the DOTS server is
   operating on the access network.

                                 Figure 2

   In typical deployments, the DOTS client belongs to a different
   administrative domain than the DOTS server.  For example, the DOTS
   client is a web server serving content owned and operated by an
   domain, while the DOTS server is owned and operated by a different
   domain providing DDoS mitigation services.  That domain providing
   DDoS mitigation service might, or might not, also provide Internet
   access service to the website operator.

   The DOTS server may (not) be co-located with the DOTS mitigator.  In
   typical deployments, the DOTS server belongs to the same
   administrative domain as the mitigator.

   The DOTS client can communicate directly with the DOTS server or
   indirectly via a DOTS gateway.

   This document focuses on the DOTS signal channel.

4.  Happy Eyeballs for DOTS Signal Channel

   DOTS signaling can happen with DTLS [RFC6347] over UDP and TLS
   [RFC5246] over TCP.  A DOTS client can use DNS to determine the IP
   address(es) of a DOTS server or a DOTS client may be provided with
   the list of DOTS server IP addresses.  The DOTS client MUST know a
   DOTS server's domain name; hard-coding the domain name of the DOTS
   server into software is NOT RECOMMENDED in case the domain name is
   not valid or needs to change for legal or other reasons.  The DOTS
   client performs A and/or AAAA record lookup of the domain name and
   the result will be a list of IP addresses, each of which can be used
   to contact the DOTS server using UDP and TCP.

   If an IPv4 path to reach a DOTS server is found, but the DOTS
   server's IPv6 path is not working, a dual-stack DOTS client can
   experience a significant connection delay compared to an IPv4-only
   DOTS client.  The other problem is that if a middlebox between the
   DOTS client and DOTS server is configured to block UDP, the DOTS
   client will fail to establish a DTLS session with the DOTS server and
   will, then, have to fall back to TLS over TCP incurring significant
   connection delays.  [I-D.ietf-dots-requirements] discusses that DOTS



Reddy, et al.             Expires June 26, 2017                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft             DOTS Signal Channel             December 2016


   client and server will have to support both connectionless and
   connection-oriented protocols.

   To overcome these connection setup problems, the DOTS client can try
   connecting to the DOTS server using both IPv6 and IPv4, and try both
   DTLS over UDP and TLS over TCP in a fashion similar to the Happy
   Eyeballs mechanism [RFC6555].  These connection attempts are
   performed by the DOTS client when its initializes, and the client
   uses that information for its subsequent alert to the DOTS server.
   In order of preference (most preferred first), it is UDP over IPv6,
   UDP over IPv4, TCP over IPv6, and finally TCP over IPv4, which
   adheres to address preference order [RFC6724] and the DOTS preference
   that UDP be used over TCP (to avoid TCP's head of line blocking).

      |                                                         |

                         Figure 3: Happy Eyeballs

   In reference to Figure 3, the DOTS client sends two TCP SYNs and two
   DTLS ClientHello messages at the same time over IPv6 and IPv4.  In
   this example, it is assumed that the IPv6 path is broken and UDP is
   dropped by a middle box but has little impact to the DOTS client
   because there is no long delay before using IPv4 and TCP.  The IPv6
   path and UDP over IPv6 and IPv4 is retried until the DOTS client
   gives up.

5.  DOTS Signal Channel

5.1.  Overview

   Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) [RFC7252] is used for DOTS
   signal channel (Figure 4).  COAP was designed according to the REST
   architecture, and thus exhibits functionality similar to that of
   HTTP, it is quite straightforward to map from CoAP to HTTP and from
   HTTP to CoAP.  CoAP has been defined to make use of both DTLS over

   UDP and TLS over TCP [I-D.ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls].  The advantages of
   COAP are: (1) Like HTTP, CoAP is based on the successful REST model,
   (2) CoAP is designed to use minimal resources, (3) CoAP integrates
   with JSON, CBOR or any other data format, (4) asynchronous message
   exchanges, (5) includes a congestion control mechanism (6) allows
   configuration of message transmission parameters specific to the
   application environment (including dynamically adjusted values, see
   Section 4.8.1 in [RFC7252]) etc.

     Figure 4: Abstract Layering of DOTS signal channel over CoAP over
                                  (D)TLS

   A single DOTS signal channel between DOTS agents can be used to
   exchange multiple DOTS signal messages.  To reduce DOTS client and
   DOTS server workload, DOTS client SHOULD re-use the (D)TLS session.

   Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) [RFC7049] is a binary
   encoding designed for small code and message size, CBOR encoded
   payloads are used to convey signal channel specific payload messages
   that convey request parameters and response information such as
   errors.  This specification uses the encoding rules defined in
   [I-D.ietf-core-yang-cbor] for representing DOTS signal channel
   configuration data defined using YANG (Section 5.2) as CBOR data.

5.3.  Mitigation Request

   The following APIs define the means to convey a DOTS signal from a
   DOTS client to a DOTS server:

   POST requests:  are used to convey the DOTS signal from a DOTS client
      to a DOTS server over the signal channel, possibly traversing a
      DOTS gateway, indicating the DOTS client's need for mitigation, as
      well as the scope of any requested mitigation (Section 5.3.1).
      DOTS gateway act as a CoAP-to-CoAP Proxy (explained in [RFC7252]).
   DELETE requests:  are used by the DOTS client to withdraw the request
      for mitigation from the DOTS server (Section 5.3.2).
   GET requests:  are used by the DOTS client to retrieve the DOTS
      signal(s) it had conveyed to the DOTS server (Section 5.3.3).
   PUT requests:  are used by the DOTS client to convey mitigation
      efficacy updates to the DOTS server (Section 5.3.4).

   Reliability is provided to the POST, DELETE, GET, and PUT requests by
   marking them as Confirmable (CON) messages.  As explained in
   Section 2.1 of [RFC7252], a Confirmable message is retransmitted
   using a default timeout and exponential back-off between
   retransmissions, until the DOTS server sends an Acknowledgement
   message (ACK) with the same Message ID conveyed from the DOTS client.
   Message transmission parameters are defined in Section 4.8 of
   [RFC7252].  Reliability is provided to the responses by marking them
   as Confirmable (CON) messages.  The DOTS server can either piggyback
   the response in the acknowledgement message or if the DOTS server is
   not able to respond immediately to a request carried in a Confirmable
   message, it simply responds with an Empty Acknowledgement message so
   that the DOTS client can stop retransmitting the request.  Empty
   Acknowledgement message is explained in Section 2.2 of [RFC7252].
   When the response is ready, the server sends it in a new Confirmable
   message which then in turn needs to be acknowledged by the DOTS
   client (see Sections 5.2.1 and Sections 5.2.2 in [RFC7252]).

   DOTS agents should follow the data transmission guidelines discussed
   in Section 3.1.3 of [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-rfc5405bis] and control
   transmission behavior by not sending on average more than one UDP
   datagram per RTT to the peer DOTS agent, and if the DOTS agent cannot
   maintain a RTT estimate then it SHOULD NOT send more than one UDP
   datagram every 3 seconds, and SHOULD use an even less aggressive rate
   when possible.

   Implementation Note: A DOTS client that receives a response in a CON
   message may want to clean up the message state right after sending
   the ACK.  If that ACK is lost and the DOTS server retransmits the
   CON, the DOTS client may no longer have any state to which to
   correlate this response, making the retransmission an unexpected

   message; the DOTS client will send a Reset message so it does not
   receive any more retransmissions.  This behavior is normal and not an
   indication of an error (see Section 5.3.2 in [RFC7252] for more
   details).

5.3.1.  Convey DOTS Signals

   When suffering an attack and desiring DoS/DDoS mitigation, a DOTS
   signal is sent by the DOTS client to the DOTS server.  A POST request
   is used to convey a DOTS signal to the DOTS server (Figure 5,
   illustrated in JSON diagnostic notation).  The DOTS server can enable
   mitigation on behalf of the DOTS client by communicating the DOTS
   client's request to the mitigator and relaying any mitigator feedback
   to the requesting DOTS client.

   The parameters are described below.

   policy-id:  Identifier for the mitigation request represented using
      an integer.  This identifier MUST be unique for each mitigation

      request bound to the DOTS client, i.e., the policy-id parameter
      value in the mitigation request needs to be unique relative to the
      policy-id parameter values of active mitigation requests conveyed
      from the DOTS client to the DOTS server.  This identifier MUST be
      generated by the DOTS client.  This document does not make any
      assumption about how this identifier is generated.  This is a
      mandatory attribute.
   target-ip:  A list of IP addresses or prefixes under attack.  IP
      addresses and prefixes are separated by commas.  Prefixes are
      represented using CIDR notation [RFC4632].  This is an optional
      attribute.
   target-port-range:  A list of ports under attack.  The port range,
      lower-port for lower port number and upper-port for upper port
      number.  When only lower-port is present, it represents a single
      port.  For TCP, UDP, SCTP, or DCCP: the range of ports (e.g.,
      1024-65535).  This is an optional attribute.
   target-protocol:  A list of protocols under attack.  Internet
      Protocol numbers.  This is an optional attribute.
   FQDN:   Fully Qualified Domain Name, is the full name of a system,
      rather than just its hostname.  For example, "venera" is a
      hostname, and "venera.isi.edu" is an FQDN.  This is an optional
      attribute.
   URI:   Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).  This is an optional
      attribute.
   E.164:   E.164 number.  This is an optional attribute.
   alias:  Name of the alias (see Section 3.1.1 in
      [I-D.reddy-dots-data-channel]).  This is an optional attribute.
   lifetime:   Lifetime of the mitigation request in seconds.  Upon the
      expiry of this lifetime, and if the request is not refreshed, the
      mitigation request is removed.  The request can be refreshed by
      sending the same request again.  The default lifetime of the
      mitigation request is 60 minutes -- this value was chosen to be
      long enough so that refreshing is not typically a burden on the
      DOTS client, while expiring the request where the client has
      unexpectedly quit in a timely manner.  A lifetime of zero
      indicates indefinite lifetime for the mitigation request.  The
      server MUST always indicate the actual lifetime in the response.
      This is an optional attribute in the request.

   The CBOR key values for the parameters are defined in Section 6.  In
   the POST request at least one of the attributes target-ip or target-
   port or target-protocol or FQDN or URI or E.164 or alias MUST be
   present.  The relative order of two mitigation requests is determined
   by comparing their respective identifiers.  The mitigation request
   with higher numeric identifier value has higher precedence (and thus
   will match before) than the mitigation request with lower numeric
   identifier value.

                      Figure 6: POST for DOTS signal

   The DOTS server indicates the result of processing the POST request
   using CoAP response codes.  CoAP 2.xx codes are success.  CoAP 4.xx
   codes are some sort of invalid requests (e.g. the mitigation request
   conflicts with a previous mitigation request already submitted to the
   DOTS server).  COAP 5.xx codes are returned if the DOTS server has
   erred or is currently unavailable to provide mitigation in response
   to the mitigation request from the DOTS client.  Response code 2.01
   (Created) will be returned in the response if the DOTS server has
   accepted the mitigation request and will try to mitigate the attack.
   If the request is missing one or more mandatory attributes, then 4.00

5.3.2.  Withdraw a DOTS Signal

   A DELETE request is used to withdraw a DOTS signal from a DOTS server
   (Figure 7).

                      Figure 7: Withdraw DOTS signal

   If the DOTS server does not find the policy-id parameter value
   conveyed in the DELETE request in its configuration data, then it
   responds with a 4.04 (Not Found) error response code.  The DOTS
   server successfully acknowledges a DOTS client's request to withdraw
   the DOTS signal using 2.02 (Deleted) response code, and ceases
   mitigation activity as quickly as possible.

5.3.3.  Retrieving a DOTS Signal

   A GET request is used to retrieve information and status of a DOTS
   signal from a DOTS server (Figure 8).  If the DOTS server does not
   find the policy-id parameter value conveyed in the GET request in its
   configuration data, then it responds with a 4.04 (Not Found) error
   response code.

   The observe option defined in [RFC7641] extends the CoAP core
   protocol with a mechanism for a CoAP client to "observe" a resource
   on a CoAP server: the client retrieves a representation of the
   resource and requests this representation be updated by the server as
   long as the client is interested in the resource.  A DOTS client
   conveys the observe option set to 0 in the GET request to receive
   unsolicited notifications of attack mitigation status from the DOTS
   server.  Unidirectional notifications within the bidirectional signal
   channel allows unsolicited message delivery, enabling asynchronous
   notifications between the agents.  A DOTS client that is no longer
   interested in receiving notifications from the DOTS server can simply
   "forget" the observation.  When the DOTS server then sends the next
   notification, the DOTS client will not recognize the token in the
   message and thus will return a Reset message.  This causes the DOTS
   server to remove the associated entry.

           Figure 10: Notifications of attack mitigation status

5.3.3.1.  Mitigation Status

   A DOTS client retrieves the information about a DOTS signal at
   frequent intervals to determine the status of an attack.  If the DOTS
   server has been able to mitigate the attack and the attack has
   stopped, the DOTS server indicates as such in the status, and the
   DOTS client recalls the mitigation request.

   A DOTS client should react to the status of the attack from the DOTS
   server and not the fact that it has recognized, using its own means,
   that the attack has been mitigated.  This ensures that the DOTS
   client does not recall a mitigation request in a premature fashion
   because it is possible that the DOTS client does not sense the DDOS
   attack on its resources but the DOTS server could be actively
   mitigating the attack and the attack is not completely averted.

5.3.4.  Efficacy Update from DOTS Client

   While DDoS mitigation is active, a DOTS client MAY frequently
   transmit DOTS mitigation efficacy updates to the relevant DOTS
   server.  An PUT request (Figure 11) is used to convey the mitigation
   efficacy update to the DOTS server.  The PUT request MUST include all
   the parameters used in the POST request to convey the DOTS signal
   (Section 5.3.1).

   The DOTS server indicates the result of processing the PUT request
   using CoAP response codes.  The response code 2.04 (Changed) will be
   returned in the response if the DOTS server has accepted the
   mitigation efficacy update.  If the DOTS server does not find the
   policy-id parameter value conveyed in the PUT request in its
   configuration data then the server MAY accept the mitigation request
   and will try to mitigate the attack, resulting in a 2.01 (Created)
   Response Code.  The 5.xx response codes are returned if the DOTS
   server has erred or is incapable of performing the mitigation.

5.4.  DOTS Signal Channel Session Configuration

   The DOTS client can negotiate, configure and retrieve the DOTS signal
   channel session behavior.  The DOTS signal channel can be used, for
   example, to configure the following:

   a.  Heartbeat interval: DOTS agents regularly send heartbeats to each
       other after mutual authentication in order to keep the DOTS
       signal channel open.
   b.  Acceptable signal loss ratio: Maximum retransmissions,
       retransmission timeout value and other message transmission
       parameters for the DOTS signal channel.

5.4.1.  Discover Acceptable Configuration Parameters

   A GET request is used to obtain acceptable configuration parameters
   on the DOTS server for DOTS signal channel session configuration.
   Figure 12 shows how to obtain acceptable configuration parameters for
   the server.

5.4.2.  Convey DOTS Signal Channel Session Configuration

   A POST request is used to convey the configuration parameters for the
   signaling channel (e.g., heartbeat interval, maximum retransmissions
   etc).  Message transmission parameters for CoAP are defined in
   Section 4.8 of [RFC7252].  These parameters can be modified by the
   DOTS agent (need not be default).  If the DOTS client wishes to
   change the default values of message transmission parameters then it
   should follow the guidence given in Section 4.8.1 of [RFC7252].  The
   signaling channel session configuration is applicable to all DOTS
   signal channel sessions between the DOTS agents.

                            configuration data.

   The parameters are described below:

   policy-id:  Identifier for the DOTS signal channel session
      configuration data represented as an integer.  This identifier
      MUST be generated by the DOTS client.  This document does not make
      any assumption about how this identifier is generated.  This is a
      mandatory attribute.
   heartbeat-interval:   Heartbeat interval to check the DOTS peer
      health.  This is an optional attribute.
   max-retransmit:   Maximum number of retransmissions for a message
      (referred to as MAX_RETRANSMIT parameter in CoAP).  This is an
      optional attribute.
   ack-timeout:   Timeout value in seconds used to calculate the intial
      retransmission timeout value (referred to as ACK_TIMEOUT parameter
      in CoAP).  This is an optional attribute.
   ack-random-factor:   Random factor used to influence the timing of
      retransmissions (referred to as ACK_RANDOM_FACTOR parameter in
      CoAP).  This is an optional attribute.

   In the POST request at least one of the attributes heartbeat-interval
   or max-retransmit or ack-timeout or ack-random-factor MUST be
   present.  The POST request with higher numeric identifier value over-
   rides the DOTS signal channel session configuration data installed by
   a POST request with a lower numeric identifier value.

   Figure 15 shows a POST request to convey the configuration parameters
   for the DOTS signal channel.

5.4.3.  Delete DOTS Signal Channel Session Configuration

   A DELETE request is used to delete the installed DOTS signal channel
   session configuration data (Figure 17).

     Header: DELETE (Code=0.04)
     Uri-Host: "host"
     Uri-Path: ".well-known"
     Uri-Path: "version"
     Uri-Path: "dots-signal"
     Uri-Path: "config"
     Content-Format: "application/cbor"
     {
       "signal-config": {
        "policy-id": integer
       }
     }

                      Figure 17: DELETE configuration

   If the DOTS server does not find the policy-id parameter value
   conveyed in the DELETE request in its configuration data, then it
   responds with a 4.04 (Not Found) error response code.  The DOTS
   server successfully acknowledges a DOTS client's request to remove
   the DOTS signal channel session configuration using 2.02 (Deleted)
   response code.

5.4.4.  Retrieving DOTS Signal Channel Session Configuration

   A GET request is used to retrieve the installed DOTS signal channel
   session configuration data from a DOTS server.  Figure 18 shows how
   to retrieve the DOTS signal channel session configuration data.

     Header: GET (Code=0.01)
     Uri-Host: "host"
     Uri-Path: ".well-known"
     Uri-Path: "version"
     Uri-Path: "dots-signal"
     Uri-Path: "config"
     Content-Format: "application/cbor"
     {
       "signal-config": {
        "policy-id": "integer"
       }
     }

5.5.  Redirected Signaling

   Redirected Signaling is discussed in detail in Section 3.2.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-dots-architecture].  If the DOTS server wants to redirect
   the DOTS client to an alternative DOTS server for a signaling session
   then the response code 3.00 (alternate server) will be returned in
   the response to the client.

   The DOTS server in the error response conveys the alternate DOTS
   server FQDN, and the alternate DOTS server IP addresses and TTL (time
   to live) values in the CBOR body.

   {
       "alt-server": "string",
       "alt-server-record": [
         {
           "addr": "string"
           "TTL" :  "integer",
         }
       ]
   }

                      Figure 19: Error response body

   The parameters are described below:

   alt-server:  FQDN of alternate DOTS server.
   addr:  IP address of alternate DOTS server.
   TTL:  Time to live represented as an integer number of seconds.

   Figure 20 shows a 3.00 response to convey the DOTS alternate server
   www.example-alt.com, its IP addresses 2002:db8:6401::1 and
   2002:db8:6401::2, and TTL values 3600 and 1800.

   {

       "alt-server": "www.example-alt.com",
       "alt-server-record": [
         {
           "TTL" :  3600,
           "addr": "2002:db8:6401::1"
         },
         {
           "TTL" :  1800,
           "addr": "2002:db8:6401::2"
         }
       ]
   }

                 Figure 20: Example of error response body

   When the DOTS client receives 3.00 response, it considers the current
   request as having failed, but SHOULD try the request with the
   alternate DOTS server.  During a DDOS attack, the DNS server may be
   subjected to DDOS attack, alternate DOTS server IP addresses conveyed
   in the 3.00 response help the DOTS client to skip DNS lookup of the
   alternate DOTS server and can try to establish UDP or TCP session
   with the alternate DOTS server IP addresses.  The DOTS client SHOULD
   implement DNS64 function to handle the scenario where IPv6-only DOTS
   client communicates with IPv4-only alternate DOTS server.

5.6.  Heartbeat Mechanism

   While the communication between the DOTS agents is quiescent, the
   DOTS client will probe the DOTS server to ensure it has maintained
   cryptographic state and vice versa.  Such probes can also keep alive
   firewall or NAT bindings.  This probing reduces the frequency of
   needing a new handshake when a DOTS signal needs to be conveyed to
   the DOTS server.  In DOTS over UDP, heartbeat messages can be
   exchanged between the DOTS agents using the "COAP ping" mechanism
   (Section 4.2 in [RFC7252]).  The DOTS agent sends an Empty
   Confirmable message and the peer DOTS agent will respond by sending
   an Reset message.  In DOTS over TCP, heartbeat messages can be
   exchanged between the DOTS agents using the Ping and Pong messages
   (Section 4.4 in [I-D.ietf-core-coap-tcp-tls]).  The DOTS agent sends
   an Ping message and the peer DOTS agent will respond by sending an
   single Pong message.

7.  (D)TLS Protocol Profile and Performance considerations

   This section defines the (D)TLS protocol profile of DOTS signal
   channel over (D)TLS and DOTS data channel over TLS.

   There are known attacks on (D)TLS, such as machine-in-the-middle and
   protocol downgrade.  These are general attacks on (D)TLS and not
   specific to DOTS over (D)TLS; please refer to the (D)TLS RFCs for
   discussion of these security issues.  DOTS agents MUST adhere to the
   (D)TLS implementation recommendations and security considerations of
   [RFC7525] except with respect to (D)TLS version.  Since encryption of
   DOTS using (D)TLS is virtually a green-field deployment DOTS agents
   MUST implement only (D)TLS 1.2 or later.

Internet-Draft             DOTS Signal Channel             December 2016


   Implementations compliant with this profile MUST implement all of the
   following items:

   o  DOTS client can use (D)TLS session resumption without server-side
      state [RFC5077] to resume session and convey the DOTS signal.
   o  Raw public keys [RFC7250] which reduce the size of the
      ServerHello, and can be used by servers that cannot obtain
      certificates (e.g., DOTS gateways on private networks).

   Implementations compliant with this profile SHOULD implement all of
   the following items to reduce the delay required to deliver a DOTS
   signal:

   o  TLS False Start [RFC7918] which reduces round-trips by allowing
      the TLS second flight of messages (ChangeCipherSpec) to also
      contain the DOTS signal.
   o  Cached Information Extension [RFC7924] which avoids transmitting
      the server's certificate and certificate chain if the client has
      cached that information from a previous TLS handshake.
   o  TCP Fast Open [RFC7413] can reduce the number of round-trips to
      convey DOTS signal.

7.1.  MTU and Fragmentation Issues

   To avoid DOTS signal message fragmentation and the consequently
   decreased probability of message delivery, DOTS agents MUST ensure
   that the DTLS record MUST fit within a single datagram.  If the Path
   MTU is not known to the DOTS server, an IP MTU of 1280 bytes SHOULD
   be assumed.  The length of the URL MUST NOT exceed 256 bytes.  If UDP
   is used to convey the DOTS signal messages then the DOTS client must
   consider the amount of record expansion expected by the DTLS
   processing when calculating the size of CoAP message that fits within
   the path MTU.  Path MTU MUST be greater than or equal to [CoAP
   message size + DTLS overhead of 13 octets + authentication overhead
   of the negotiated DTLS cipher suite + block padding (Section 4.1.1.1
   of [RFC6347]].  If the request size exceeds the Path MTU then the
   DOTS client MUST split the DOTS signal into separate messages, for
   example the list of addresses in the 'target-ip' parameter could be
   split into multiple lists and each list conveyed in a new POST
   request.

   Implementation Note: DOTS choice of message size parameters works
   well with IPv6 and with most of today's IPv4 paths.  However, with
   IPv4, it is harder to absolutely ensure that there is no IP
   fragmentation.  If IPv4 support on unusual networks is a
   consideration and path MTU is unknown, implementations may want to
   limit themselves to more conservative IPv4 datagram sizes such as 576
   bytes, as per [RFC0791] IP packets up to 576 bytes should never need

   to be fragmented, thus sending a maximum of 500 bytes of DOTS signal
   over a UDP datagram will generally avoid IP fragmentation.

8.  (D)TLS 1.3 considerations

   TLS 1.3 [I-D.ietf-tls-tls13] provides critical latency improvements
   for connection establishment over TLS 1.2.  The DTLS 1.3 protocol
   [I-D.rescorla-tls-dtls13] is based on the TLS 1.3 protocol and
   provides equivalent security guarantees.  (D)TLS 1.3 provides two
   basic handshake modes of interest to DOTS signal channel:

   o  Absent packet loss, a full handshake in which the DOTS client is
      able to send the DOTS signal message after one round trip and the
      DOTS server immediately after receiving the first DOTS signal
      message from the client.
   o  0-RTT mode in which the DOTS client can authenticate itself and
      send DOTS signal message on its first flight, thus reducing
      handshake latency. 0-RTT only works if the DOTS client has
      previously communicated with that DOTS server, which is very
      likely with the DOTS signal channel.  The DOTS client SHOULD
      establish a (D)TLS session with the DOTS server during peacetime
      and share a PSK.  During DDOS attack, the DOTS client can use the
      (D)TLS session to convey the DOTS signal message and if there is
      no response from the server after multiple re-tries then the DOTS
      client can resume the (D)TLS session in 0-RTT mode using PSK.  A
      simplified TLS 1.3 handshake with 0-RTT DOTS signal message
      exchange is shown in Figure 22.

9.  Mutual Authentication of DOTS Agents & Authorization of DOTS Clients

   (D)TLS based on client certificate can be used for mutual
   authentication between DOTS agents.  If a DOTS gateway is involved,
   DOTS clients and DOTS gateway MUST perform mutual authentication;
   only authorized DOTS clients are allowed to send DOTS signals to a
   DOTS gateway.  DOTS gateway and DOTS server MUST perform mutual
   authentication; DOTS server only allows DOTS signals from authorized
   DOTS gateway, creating a two-link chain of transitive authentication
   between the DOTS client and the DOTS server.

   Figure 23: Example of Authentication and Authorization of DOTS Agents

   In the example depicted in Figure 23, the DOTS gateway and DOTS
   clients within the 'example.com' domain mutually authenticate with
   each other.  After the DOTS gateway validates the identity of a DOTS
   client, it communicates with the AAA server in the 'example.com'
   domain to determine if the DOTS client is authorized to request DDOS
   mitigation.  If the DOTS client is not authorized, a 4.01
   (Unauthorized) is returned in the response to the DOTS client.  In
   this example, the DOTS gateway only allows the application server and
   DDOS detector to request DDOS mitigation, but does not permit the
   user of type 'guest' to request DDOS mitigation.

   Also, DOTS gateway and DOTS server MUST perform mutual authentication
   using certificates.  A DOTS server will only allow a DOTS gateway
   with a certificate for a particular domain to request mitigation for
   that domain.  In reference to Figure 23, the DOTS server only allows
   the DOTS gateway to request mitigation for 'example.com' domain and
   not for other domains.

11.  Security Considerations

   Authenticated encryption MUST be used for data confidentiality and
   message integrity.  (D)TLS based on client certificate MUST be used
   for mutual authentication.  The interaction between the DOTS agents
   requires Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) and Transport Layer
   Security (TLS) with a cipher suite offering confidentiality
   protection and the guidance given in [RFC7525] MUST be followed to
   avoid attacks on (D)TLS.

   If TCP is used between DOTS agents, an attacker may be able to inject
   RST packets, bogus application segments, etc., regardless of whether
   TLS authentication is used.  Because the application data is TLS
   protected, this will not result in the application receiving bogus
   data, but it will constitute a DoS on the connection.  This attack
   can be countered by using TCP-AO [RFC5925].  If TCP-AO is used, then
   any bogus packets injected by an attacker will be rejected by the
   TCP-AO integrity check and therefore will never reach the TLS layer.

   Special care should be taken in order to ensure that the activation
   of the proposed mechanism won't have an impact on the stability of
   the network (including connectivity and services delivered over that
   network).

   Involved functional elements in the cooperation system must establish
   exchange instructions and notification over a secure and
   authenticated channel.  Adequate filters can be enforced to avoid

   that nodes outside a trusted domain can inject request such as
   deleting filtering rules.  Nevertheless, attacks can be initiated
   from within the trusted domain if an entity has been corrupted.
   Adequate means to monitor trusted nodes should also be enabled.
