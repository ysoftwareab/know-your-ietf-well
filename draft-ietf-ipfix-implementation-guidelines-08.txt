Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The IPFIX protocol defines how IP Flow information can be exported
   from routers, measurement probes or other devices.  In this document,
   we provide guidelines for its implementation.

   The guidelines are split into five main sets.  These sets address
   implementation aspects for Template management, Exporting Process,
   Collecting Process, transport, and implementation on middleboxes.

   Finally, this document contains a list of common mistakes about
   issues that had been misinterpreted in the first IPFIX
   implementations and created (and still might create) interoperability
   problems.

1.1.  IPFIX Documents Overview

   The IPFIX Protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] provides network
   administrators with access to IP flow information.  The architecture
   for the export of measured IP flow information out of an IPFIX
   exporting process to a collecting process is defined in the IPFIX
   Architecture [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture], per the requirements
   defined in RFC 3917 [RFC3917].

   The IPFIX Architecture [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] specifies how
   IPFIX data record and templates are carried via a congestion-aware
   transport protocol from IPFIX exporting processes to IPFIX collecting
   process.

   IPFIX has a formal description of IPFIX information elements, their
   name, type and additional semantic information, as specified in the
   IPFIX Information Model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].

   Finally the IPFIX Applicability Statement [I-D.ietf-ipfix-as]
   describes what type of applications can use the IPFIX protocol and
   how they can use the information provided.  It furthermore shows how
   the IPFIX framework relates to other architectures and frameworks.

1.2.  Overview of the IPFIX Protocol

   In the IPFIX protocol, { type, length, value } tuples are expressed
   in templates containing { type, length } pairs, specifying which {
   value } fields are present in data records conforming to the
   template, giving great flexibility as to what data is transmitted.

   Since templates are sent very infrequently compared with data
   records, this results in significant bandwidth savings.




Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 4]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   Different data records may be transmitted simply by sending new
   templates specifying the { type, length } pairs for the new data
   format.  See [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] for more information.

   The IPFIX Information Model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] defines a large
   number of standard Information Elements which provide the necessary {
   type } information for templates.

   The use of standard elements enables interoperability among different
   vendors' implementations.  The list of standard elements may be
   extended in future through the process defined in Section 9 below.
   Additionally, non-standard enterprise-specific elements may be
   defined for private use.


2.  Terminology

   The terminology used in this document is fully aligned with the
   terminology defined in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  Therefore, the
   terms defined in the IPFIX terminology are capitalized in this
   document, as in other IPFIX drafts ([I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol],
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info], [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture]).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   This document is Informational.  It does not specify a protocol and
   does not use RFC 2119 keywords [RFC2119] such as "MUST" and "SHOULD",
   except in quotations and restatements from the IPFIX standards
   documents.  The normative specification of the protocol is given in
   the IPFIX Protocol [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] and Information Model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] documents.


3.  Template Management Guidelines

3.1.  Template Management

   The Exporting Process should always endeavour to send Template
   Records before the related Data Records.  However, since the Template
   Record may not arrive before the corresponding Data Records, the
   Collecting Process MAY store Data Records with an unknown Template ID
   pending the arrival of the corresponding Template (cf. section 9 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]).  If no Template becomes available, the
   event should be logged and the Transport Session reset (unless UDP is
   used), which will cause the Templates to be resent.  The amount of
   time the Collecting Process waits for a Template before resetting



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   should be configurable.  We recommend a default of 30 minutes.  Note
   that when using UDP as the transport protocol, this delay should be
   bound, when possible, by the Template Retransmit and the Template
   Expiry times (cf. Section 6.2).

   The Exporting Process must be able to resend active Templates, in
   case of SCTP association restart, UDP template refresh, or TCP
   connection restart.

   The Exporting Process is responsible for the management of Template
   IDs.  Should insufficient Template IDs be available, the Exporting
   Process must send a Template Withdraw Message in order to free up the
   allocation of unused Template IDs.  Note that UDP doesn't use the
   Template Withdraw message and the Template lifetime on the Collecting
   Process relies on timeout.

3.2.  Template Records versus Option Template Records

   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] defines and specifies the use of Templates
   and Options Templates.  Templates define the layout of Data Records,
   which represent flow data.  Options Templates additionally specify
   scope information elements, which can be used to define scoped Data
   Records.  Scoped Data Records generally export control plane data
   (such as metadata about processes in the IPFIX collection
   architecture) or data otherwise applicable to multiple flow Data
   Records (such as common properties as in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-reducing-redundancy]).

   Aside from section 4 of [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], which defines
   specific Options Templates to use for reporting Metering Process and
   Exporting Process statistics and configuration information, the
   choice to use Options Templates is left up to the implementer.
   Indeed, there is a trade-off between bandwidth efficiency and
   complexity in the use of Options Templates and scoped Data Records.

   For example, control plane information about an Observation Point
   could be exported with every Flow Record measured at that Observation
   Point, or in a single Data Record described by an Options Template,
   scoped to the Observation Point identifier.  In the former case,
   simplicity of decoding the data is gained in exchange for redundant
   export of the same data with every applicable Flow Record.  The
   latter case is more bandwidth efficient, but at the expense of
   requiring the Collecting Process to maintain the relationship between
   each applicable Flow Record and the Observation Point.

   A generalized method of using Options Templates to increase bandwidth
   efficiency is fully described in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-reducing-redundancy].

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


3.3.  Using Scopes

   The root scope for all IPFIX Messages is the Observation Domain,
   which appears in the Message Header.  In other words, all Data
   Records within a message implicitly belong to the Observation Domain.
   All Data Records described by Options Templates (and only those) must
   be restricted to an additional scope within the Observation Domain,
   as defined by the scope Information Elements in the Options Template
   Record.

   In IPFIX any Information Element can be used for scope.  However,
   Information Elements such as counters, timestamps, padding elements,
   Flow properties like timeout, flow end reason, duration, or Min/Max
   Flow properties [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] may not be appropriate.

   Note that it is sometimes necessary to export information about
   entities that exist outside any Observation Domain, or within
   multiple Observation Domains (e.g. information about Metering
   Processes scoped to meteringProcessID).  Such information SHOULD be
   exported in an IPFIX Message with Observation Domain ID 0 (cf.
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], Section 3.1).

3.4.  Multiple Information Elements of the same type

   Exporting Process and Collecting Process MUST support the use of
   multiple Information Elements of the same type in a single Template
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  This was first required by Packet
   Sampling (PSAMP) for the export of multiple Selector IDs.  Note that
   the IPFIX Protocol recommends that Metering Processes SHOULD use
   packet treatment order when exporting multiple identical Information
   Elements in the same record ([I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] Section 8).
   This implies that ordering is important, and changes to the order of
   multiple identical Information Elements could cause information loss.
   Therefore, we strongly recommend preservation of the order of
   multiple Information Elements of the same type by Exporting and
   Collecting Processes for correct processing and storage.

3.5.  Selecting Message Size

   The IPFIX Protocol in section 10.3.3 defines the maximum message size
   for IPFIX Messages transported over UDP to be constrained by the path
   MTU, or if the path MTU is not available, 512 bytes which is the
   minimum datagram size all IP implementations must support (Cf. also
   Section 8.4).  However, no maximum message size is imposed on other
   transport protocols, beyond the 65535-byte limit imposed by the 16-
   bit Message Length field in the IPFIX Message Header.

   An IPFIX Exporting Process operating over SCTP or TCP may export



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 7]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   IPFIX Messages up to this 64kB limit, and an IPFIX Collecting Process
   must accept any message up to that size.


4.  Exporting Process Guidelines

4.1.  Sets

   A Set is identified by a Set ID [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].  A Set ID
   has an integral data type and its value is in the range of 0 - 65535.
   The Set ID values of 0 and 1 are not used for historical reasons
   [RFC3954].  A value of 2 identifies a Template Set. A value of 3
   identifies an Options Template Set. Values from 4 to 255 are reserved
   for future use.  Values above 255 are used for Data Sets.  In this
   case the SetID corresponds to the TemplateID of the used Template.

   A Data Set received with an unknown Set ID may be stored pending the
   arrival of the corresponding Template (cf. section 9 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]).  If no Template becomes available, the
   event should be logged and the Transport Session reset (unless UDP is
   used), which will cause the Templates to be resent.  The amount of
   time the Collecting Process waits for a Template before resetting
   should be configurable.  We recommend a default of 30 minutes.  Note
   that when using UDP as the transport protocol, this delay should be
   bound, when possible, by the Template Retransmit and the Template
   Expiry times (cf. Section 6.2).

   The arrival of a Set with a reserved Set ID should be logged.  The
   collector must ignore the unknown Set.

4.2.  Information Element Coding

   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] does not specify which entities are
   responsible for the encoding and decoding of Information Elements
   transferred via IPFIX.  An IPFIX device can do the encoding either
   within the Metering Process or within the Exporting Process.  The
   decoding of the Information Elements can be done by the Collecting
   Process or by the data processing application.

   If an IPFIX node simply relays IPFIX Records (like a proxy) then no
   decoding or encoding of Information Elements is needed.  In this case
   the Exporting Process may export unknown Information Elements, i.e.
   Information Elements with an unknown Information Element number.

4.3.  Using Counters

   IPFIX offers both Delta and Total counters (e.g. octetDeltaCount,
   octetTotalCount).  If information about a flow is only ever exported



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 8]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   once, then it's not important whether Delta or Total counters are
   used.  However, if further information about additional packets in a
   flow is exported after the first export then either:

   o  the metering system must reset its counters to zero after the
      first export and report the new counter values using delta
      counters.

   Or

   o  the metering system must carefully maintain its counters and
      report the running total using total counters.

   At first, reporting the running total may seem to be the obvious
   choice, but requires that the system accurately maintains information
   about the flow over a long time without any loss or error, because
   when reported to a Collecting Process, the previous total values will
   be replaced with the new information.

   Delta counters offer some advantages: information about flows don't
   have to be permanently maintained, and any loss of information has
   only a small impact on the total stored at the Collecting Process.
   Finally, deltas may be exported in fewer bytes than total counters
   using the IPFIX "Reduced Size Encoding" scheme
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].

   Note that delta counters have an origin of zero, and that a
   Collecting Process receiving delta counters for a flow that is new to
   the Collecting Process must assume the deltas are from zero.

4.4.  Padding

   The IPFIX Information Model defines an Information Element for
   padding called paddingOctets [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info].  It is of type
   octetArray and the IPFIX protocol allows encoding it as a fixed-
   length array as well as a variable length array.

   The padding Information Element can be used to align Information
   Elements within Data Records, Records within Sets, and Sets within
   IPFIX messages, as described below.

4.4.1.  Alignment of Information Elements within a Data Record

   The padding Information Element gives flexible means for aligning
   Information Elements within a Data Record.  Aligning within a Data
   Record can be useful, because internal data structures can be easily
   converted into Flow Records at the Exporter and vice versa at the
   Collecting Process.



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                  [Page 9]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   Alignment of Information Elements within a Data Record is achieved by
   inserting an instances of the paddingOctets Information Element with
   appropriate length before each unaligned Information Element.  This
   insertion is explicitly specified within the Template Record or
   Option template record, respectively, that corresponds to the Data
   Record.

4.4.2.  Alignment of Information Elements specifiers within a Template
        Record

   There is no means for aligning Information Element specifiers within
   Template Records.  However, there is limited need for such a method,
   as Information Element specifiers are always 32-bit aligned, and 32-
   bit alignment is generally sufficient.

4.4.3.  Alignment of Records within a Set

   There is no means for aligning Template Records within a Set.
   However, there is limited need for such a method, as Information
   Element specifiers are always 32-bit aligned, and 32-bit alignment is
   generally sufficient.

   Data Records can be aligned within a Set by appending instances of
   the paddingOctets Information Element at the end of the Record.
   Since all Data Records within a Set have the same structure and size,
   aligning one Data Record implies aligning all the Data Records within
   a single Set.

4.4.4.  Alignment of Sets within an IPFIX Message

   If Records are already aligned within a Set by using paddingOctets
   Information Elements, then this alignment will already be achieved.
   But for aligning Sets within an IPFIX message, padding Information
   Elements can be used at the end of the Set so that the subsequent Set
   starts at an aligned boundary.  This padding mechanism is described
   in section 3.3.1 of [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] and can be applied even
   if the records within sets are not aligned.  However, it should be
   noted that this method is limited by the constraint that "the padding
   length MUST be shorter than any allowable Record in the Set", to
   prevent the padding from being misinterpreted as an additional Data
   Record.

4.5.  Time Issues

   IPFIX messages contain the export time in the message header.  In
   addition there are a series of information elements defined to
   transfer time values.  [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] defines four abstract
   data types to transfer time values in second, millisecond,



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 10]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   microsecond and nanosecond resolution.

   The accuracy and precision of these values depends on the accuracy
   and the precision of the Metering Process clock.  The accuracy and
   precision of the Exporting Process clock, and the synchronisation of
   the Metering Process and Exporting Process clocks, is also important
   when using the delta timestamp Information Elements.  To ensure
   accuracy the clocks should be synchronised to a UTC time source.
   Normally it would be sufficient to derive the time from a remote time
   server using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) [RFC1305].  IPFIX
   Devices operating with time values of microsecond or nanosecond
   resolution need direct access to a time source, for example to a GPS
   (Global Positioning System) unit.

   The most important consideration in selecting timestamp Information
   Elements is to use a precision appropriate for the timestamps as
   received from the Metering Process.  Specifically, an Exporting
   Process should not export timestamp Information Elements of higher
   precision than the timestamps used by the Metering Process (e.g.
   millisecond-precision flows should not be exported with
   flowStartMicroseconds and flowEndMicroseconds).

4.6.  IPFIX Message Header Export Time and Data Record Time

   Section 5 of [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] defines a method for optimized
   export of time-related Information Elements based upon the Export
   Time field of the IPFIX Message header.  The architectural separation
   of the Metering Process and Exporting Process in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-architecture] raises some difficulties with this
   method, of which implementers should be aware.

   Since the Metering Process has no information about the export time
   of the IPFIX Message (that is, when the message leaves the Exporting
   Process), it cannot properly use the delta time Information Elements;
   it must store absolute timestamps and transmit these to the Exporting
   Process.  The Exporting Process must then convert these to delta
   timestamps once the Export Time is known.  This increases the
   processing burden on the Exporting Process.  Note also that the
   absolute timestamps require more storage than their delta timestamp
   counterparts.  However, this method can result in reduced export
   bandwidth.

   Alternatively, the Exporting Process may simply export absolute
   timestamp Information Elements.  This simplifies the Exporting
   Process' job and reduces processing burden, but increases export
   bandwidth requirements.

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


4.7.  Devices Without an Absolute Clock

   Exporting just relative times in a device without an absolute clock
   is often not sufficient.  For instance, observed traffic could be
   retained in the device's cache for some time before being exported
   (e.g., if the exporter runs once per minute), or stuck in an Inter
   Process Communication (IPC) queue, or stuck in the export stack, or
   delayed in the network between the exporter and collector.

   For these reasons it can be difficult for the Collecting Process to
   convert the relative times exported using the flowStartSysUpTime and
   flowEndSysUpTime Information Elements to absolute times with any sort
   of accuracy without knowing the systemInitTimeMilliseconds.  The
   sending of the flowStartSysUpTime and flowEndSysUpTime Information
   Elements without also sending the systemInitTimeMilliseconds
   Information Element is not recommended.


5.  Collecting Process Guidelines

5.1.  Information Element (de)coding

   Section 9 of [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] specifies: "The Collecting
   Process MUST note the Information Element identifier of any
   Information Element that it does not understand and MAY discard that
   Information Element from the Flow Record".  The Collecting Process
   may accept Templates with Information Elements of unknown types.  In
   this case the value received for these Information Elements should be
   decoded as an octet array.

   Alternatively, the Collecting Process may ignore Templates and
   subsequent Data Sets that contain Information Elements of unknown
   types.

   It is recommended that Collecting Processes provide means to flexibly
   add types of new Information Elements to their knowledge base.  An
   example is a configuration file that is read by the Collecting
   Process and that contains a list of Information Element identifiers
   and the corresponding types.  Particularly for adding enterprise-
   specific Information Elements, such a feature can be very useful.

5.2.  Reduced-size Encoding of Information Elements

   Since a Collector may receive data from the same device and
   Observation Domain in two templates using different reduced size
   encodings, it is recommended that the data be stored using full size
   encoding, to ensure that the values can be stored or even aggregated
   together.

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


5.3.  Template Management

   Template IDs are generated dynamically by the Exporting Process.
   They are unique per Transport Session and Observation Domain.

   Therefore, for each Transport Session, the Collecting Process has to
   maintain a list of Observation Domains.  For each Observation Domain
   the Collecting Process has to maintain a list of current Template IDs
   in order to decode subsequent Data Records.

   Note that a restart of the Transport Session may lead to a Template
   ID renumbering.


6.  Transport-Specific Guidelines

   IPFIX can use SCTP, TCP, or UDP as a transport protocol.  IPFIX
   implementations MUST support SCTP with partial reliability extensions
   (PR-SCTP), and MAY support TCP and/or UDP (Cf.
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol], Section 10.1).  In the IPFIX documents the
   terms SCTP and PR-SCTP are often used interchangeably to mean SCTP
   with partial reliability extensions.

6.1.  SCTP

   PR-SCTP is the preferred transport protocol for IPFIX because it is
   congestion-aware, reducing total bandwidth usage in the case of
   congestion, but with a simpler state machine than TCP.  This saves
   resources on lightweight probes and router line cards.

   SCTP as specified in RFC 4960 [RFC4960] with the PR-SCTP extension
   defined in RFC 3758 [RFC3758] provides several features not available
   in TCP or UDP.  The two of these most universally applicable to IPFIX
   implementations, and that IPFIX implementors need to know about, are
   multiple streams and per-message partial reliability.

   An SCTP association may contain multiple streams.  Streams are useful
   for avoiding head-of-line blocking, thereby minimising end to end
   delay from the Exporting Process to the Collecting Process.  Example
   applications for this feature would be using one SCTP stream per
   Observation Domain, one stream per type of data (or Template ID), or
   one stream for flow data and one for metadata.

   An Exporting Process may request any number of streams, and may send
   IPFIX Messages containing any type of Set (Data Set, Template Set,
   etc.) on any stream.  A Collecting Process MUST be able to process
   any Message received on any stream.




Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 13]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   Stream negotiation is a feature of the SCTP protocol.  Note however,
   that the IPFIX protocol doesn't provide any mechanism for the
   Exporter to convey any information about which streams are in use to
   the Collector.  Therefore, stream configuration must be done out of
   band.

   One extra advantage of the PR-SCTP association is its ability to send
   messages with different levels of reliability, selected according to
   the application.  For example, billing or security applications might
   require reliable delivery of all their IPFIX Messages, while capacity
   planning applications might be more tolerant of message loss.  SCTP
   allows IPFIX Messages for all these applications to be transported
   over the same association.

   IPFIX Messages may be sent with full or partial reliability, on a
   per-message basis.  Fully reliable delivery guarantees that the IPFIX
   Message will be received at the Collecting Process or that that SCTP
   Association will be reset, as with TCP.  Partially reliable delivery
   does not guarantee the receipt of the IPFIX Message at the collecting
   process.  This feature may be used to allow Messages to be dropped
   during network congestion, i.e. while observing a Denial of Service
   attack.

   RFC 3758 [RFC3758] defines the concept of a Partial Reliablity
   policy, which specifies the interface used to control partially
   reliable delivery.  It also defines a single example Partial
   Reliability policy called "timed reliability", which uses a single
   parameter, lifetime.  The lifetime is specified per message in
   milliseconds, and after it expires no further attempt will be made to
   transmit the message.  Longer lifetimes specify more retransmission
   attempts per message and therefore higher reliability; however, it
   should be noted that the absolute reliability provided by a given
   lifetime is highly dependent on network conditions, so an Exporting
   Process using the timed reliability service should provide a
   mechanism for configuring the lifetime of exported IPFIX Messages.
   Another possible partial reliability policy could be limited
   retransmission which guarantees a specified number of retransmissions
   for each message.  It is up to the implementer to decide which
   Partial Reliability policy is most appropriate for its application.

   There is an additional service provided by SCTP and useful in
   conjunction with PR-SCTP: unordered delivery.  This also works on a
   per-message basis by declaring that a given message should be
   delivered to the receiver as soon as it is queued rather than kept in
   sequence; however, it should be noted that unless explicitly
   requested by the sender even messages sent partially reliably will
   still be delivered in order.  Unordered delivery should not be used
   when the order of IPFIX Messages may matter: e.g., a Template or



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 14]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   Options Template.  Unordered delivery should not be used when Total
   counters are used, as reordering could result in the counter value
   decreasing at the Collecting Process, and even being left with a
   stale value if the last message processed is stale.

   By convention, when the IPFIX documents state a requirement for
   reliable delivery (as, for example, the IPFIX Protocol document does
   for Template Sets, Options Template Sets, and Template Withdrawal
   Messages), an IPFIX Exporting Process must not use partially reliable
   delivery for those Messages.  By default, and explicitly if the IPFIX
   documents call for "partially reliable" or "unreliable" delivery, an
   IPFIX Exporting Process may use partially reliable delivery if the
   other requirements of the application allow.

   The Collecting Process may check whether IPFIX Messages are lost by
   checking the Sequence Number in the IPFIX header.  The Collecting
   Process should use the Sequence Number in the IPFIX Message header to
   determine whether any messages are lost when sent with partial
   reliability.  Sequence numbers should be tracked independently for
   each stream.

   The following may be done to mitigate message loss:

   o  Increase the SCTP buffer size on the Exporter.

   o  Increase the bandwidth available for communicating the exported
      Data Records.

   o  Use sampling, filtering, or aggregation in the Metering Process to
      reduce the amount of exported data (cf. [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]
      section 10.4.2.3).

   o  If partial reliability is used, switch to fully reliable delivery
      on the Exporting Process or increase the level of partial
      reliability (e.g., when using timed reliability, by specifying a
      longer lifetime for exported IPFIX Messages).

   If the SCTP association is brought down because the IFPIX Messages
   can't be exported reliably, the options are:

   o  Increase the SCTP buffer size on the Exporter.

   o  Increase the bandwidth available for communicating the exported
      Data Records.

   o  Use sampling, filtering, or aggregation in the Metering Process to
      reduce the amount of exported data.




Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 15]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   Note that Templates must not be resent when using SCTP, without an
   intervening Template Withdrawal or SCTP association reset.  Note also
   that since Template Sets and Template Withdrawal Messages may be sent
   on any SCTP stream, a Template Withdrawal Message may withdraw a
   template sent on a different stream, and a Template Set may reuse a
   Template ID withdrawn by a Template Withdrawal Message sent on a
   different stream.  Therefore, an Exporting Process sending Template
   Withdrawal Messages should ensure to the extent possible that the
   Template Withdrawal Messages and subsequent Template Sets reusing the
   withdrawn Template IDs are received and processed at the Collecting
   Process in proper order.  The Exporting Process can achieve this by
   one of two possible methods: 1. by sending a Template Withdrawal
   Message reliably, in order, and on the same stream as the subsequent
   Template Set reusing its ID; or 2. by waiting an appropriate amount
   of time (on the scale of one minute) after sending a Template
   Withdrawal Message before attempting to reuse the withdrawn Template
   ID.

6.2.  UDP

   UDP is useful in simple systems where an SCTP stack is not available,
   and where there is insufficient memory for TCP buffering.

   However, UDP is not a reliable transport protocol, and IPFIX messages
   sent over UDP might be lost as with partially-reliable SCTP streams.
   UDP is not the recommended protocol for IPFIX and is intended for use
   in cases in which IPFIX is replacing an existing NetFlow
   infrastructure, with the following properties:

   o  A dedicated network,

   o  within a single administrative domain,

   o  where SCTP is not available due to implementation constraints,

   o  and the collector is as topologically close as possible to the
      exporter.

   Note that because UDP itself provides no congestion control
   mechanisms, it is recommended to use UDP transport only on managed
   networks, where the network path has been explicitly provisioned for
   IPFIX traffic through traffic engineering mechanisms, such as rate
   limiting or capacity reservations.

   An important example of an explicitly provisioned managed network for
   IPFIX is use of IPFIX to replace a functioning NetFlow implementation
   on a dedicated network.  In this situation, the dedicated network
   should be provisioned in accordance with the NetFlow deployment

   experience that flow export traffic generated by monitoring an
   interface will amount to 2-5% of the monitored interface's bandwidth.

   As recommended in [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines] an application
   should not send UDP messages that result in IP packets that exceed
   the MTU of the path to the destination and should enable UDP
   checksums (see sections 3.2 and 3.4 of
   [I-D.ietf-tsvwg-udp-guidelines] respectively).

   Since IPFIX assumes reliable transport of templates over SCTP, this
   necessitates some changes for IPFIX template management over UDP.
   Templates sent from the Exporting Process to the Collecting Process
   over UDP MUST be resent at regular time intervals ; these intervals
   MUST be configurable (see Section 10.3 of [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]).

   We recommend a default Template resend time of 10 minutes,
   configurable between 1 minute and 1 day.

   Note that this could become an interoperability problem, e.g. if an
   Exporter re-sends Templates once per day, while a Collector expires
   Templates hourly, then they may both be IPFIX-compatible, but not be
   interoperable.

   Retransmission time intervals that are too short waste bandwidth on
   unnecessary template retransmissions.  On the other hand, time
   intervals that are too long introduce additional costs or risk of
   data loss by potentially requiring the Collector to cache more data
   without having the Templates available to decode it.

   To increase reliability and limit the amount of potentially lost data
   the Exporting Process may resend additional templates using a packet-
   based schedule.  In this case Templates are resent depending on the
   number of data packets sent.  Similarly to the time interval,
   resending a Template every few packets introduces additional overhead
   while resending after a large amount of packets have already been
   sent means high costs due to the data caching and potential data
   loss.

   We recommend a default Template resend interval of 20 packets,
   configurable between 1 and 1000 packets.

   Note that a sufficiently small resend time or packet interval may
   cause a system to become stuck, continually re-sending templates.
   e.g., if the resend packet interval is 2 (i.e., templates are to be
   sent in every other packet) but more than two packets are required to
   send all the templates, then the resend interval will have expired by
   the time the templates have been sent, and templates will be sent
   continuously - possibly preventing any data from being sent at all.



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   Therefore the Template resend intervals should be considered from the
   last data packet, and should not be tied to specific sequence
   numbers.

   The Collecting Process should use the Sequence Number in the IPFIX
   Message header to determine whether any messages are lost.

   The following may be done to mitigate message loss:

   o  Move the Collector topologically closer to the Exporter.

   o  Increase the bandwidth of the links through which the Data Records
      are exported.

   o  Use sampling, filtering, or aggregation in the Metering Process to
      reduce the amount of exported data.

   o  Increase the buffer size at the Collector and/or the Exporter.

   Before using a Template for the first time, the Exporter may send it
   in several different IPFIX Messages spaced out over a period of
   packets in order to increase the likelihood that the Collector has
   received the Template.

   Template Withdraw messages MUST NOT be sent over UDP (Section 10.3.6
   of [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]).  The Exporter must rely on expiration
   at the Collector to expire old Templates or to reuse Template Ids.

   We recommend that the collector implements a template expiry of three
   times the Exporter refresh rate.

   However, since the IPFIX protocol doesn't provide any mechanism for
   the Exporter to convey any information about the Template expiry time
   to the Collector, configuration must be done out of band.

   If no out of band configuration is made, we recommend to initially
   set a template expiry time at the Collector of 60 minutes.  The
   Collecting Process may estimate each Exporting Process's resend time
   and adapt the expiry time for the corresponding Templates
   accordingly.

6.3.  TCP

   TCP can be used as a transport protocol for IPFIX if one of the
   endpoints has no support for SCTP, but a reliable transport is needed
   and/or the network between the exporter and the collector has not
   explicitly been provisioned for the IPFIX traffic.  TCP is one of the
   core protocols of the Internet, and is widely supported.

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   The Exporting Process may re-send Templates (per UDP, above), but
   it's not required to do so, per section 10.4.2.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]:

   "A Collecting Process MUST record all Template and Options Template
   Records for the duration of the connection, as an Exporting Process
   is not required to re-export Template Records."

   If the available bandwidth between exporter and collector is not
   sufficient or the metering process generates more data records than
   the collector is capable of processing, then TCP congestion control
   may cause the exporter to block.  Options in this case are:

   o  Increase the TCP buffer size on the Exporter.

   o  Increase the bandwidth of the links through which the Data Records
      are exported.

   o  Use sampling, filtering, or aggregation in the Metering Process to
      reduce the amount of exported data.


7.  Guidelines for implementation on Middleboxes

   The term middlebox is defined in RFC 3234 [RFC3234] as:

   "A middlebox is defined as any intermediary device performing
   functions other than the normal, standard functions of an IP router
   on the datagram path between a source host and destination host."

   The list of middleboxes discussed in RFC 3234 contains:

   1.   Network Address Translation (NAT),

   2.   NAT-Protocol Translation (NAT-PT),

   3.   SOCKS gateway,

   4.   IP tunnel endpoints,

   5.   packet classifiers, markers, schedulers,

   6.   transport relay,

   7.   TCP performance enhancing proxies,

   8.   load balancers that divert/munge packets,

   9.   IP firewalls,

   10.  application firewalls,

   11.  application-level gateways,

   12.  gatekeepers / session control boxes,

   13.  transcoders,

   14.  proxies,

   15.  caches,

   16.  modified DNS servers,

   17.  content and applications distribution boxes,

   18.  load balancers that divert/munge URLs,

   19.  application-level interceptors,

   20.  application-level multicast,

   21.  involuntary packet redirection,

   22.  anonymizers.

   It is likely that since the publication of RFC 3234 new kinds of
   middleboxes have been added.

   While the IPFIX specifications [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] based the
   requirements on the export protocol only (as the IPFIX name implies),
   these sections cover the guidelines for the implementation of the
   Metering Process by recommending which Information Elements to export
   for the different middlebox considerations.

7.1.  Traffic Flow Scenarios at Middleboxes

   Middleboxes may delay, re-order, drop, or multiply packets; they may
   change packet header fields and change the payload.  All these
   actions have an impact on traffic flow properties.  In general, a
   middlebox transforms a uni-directional original traffic flow T that
   arrives at the middlebox into a transformed traffic flow T' that
   leaves the middlebox.

   Note that in an extreme case, T' may be an empty traffic flow (a flow
   with no packets), for example, if the middlebox is a firewall and
   blocks the flow.

   In case of a middlebox performing a multicast function, a single
   original traffic flow may be transformed into more than one
   transformed traffic flow.

   realm and T_r the translated traffic flow in the public address
   realm.  If the middlebox is a NAT-PT, then T_l may be an IPv4 traffic
   flow and T_r the translated IPv6 traffic flow.

   An example is a traffic flow T_l of a tunnel and flows T_rx that are
   multiplexed into or de-multiplexed out of a tunnel.  According to the
   IPFIX definition of traffic flows in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] T and
   T' or T_l and T_rx, respectively, are different flows in general.

   However, from an application point of view, they might be considered
   as closely related or even as the same flow, for example if the
   payloads they carry are identical.

7.2.  Location of the Observation Point

   Middleboxes might be integrated with other devices.  An example is a
   router with a NAT or a firewall at a line card.  If an IPFIX
   Observation Point is located at the line card, then the properties of
   measured traffic flows may depend on the side of the integrated
   middlebox at which packets were captured for traffic flow
   measurement.

   Consequently, an Exporting Process reporting traffic Flows measured
   at a device that hosts one or more middleboxes should clearly
   indicate to Collecting Processes the location of the used observation
   point(s) with respect to the middlebox(es).  This can be done by
   using Options with Observation Point as Scope and elements like for
   instance lineCardID or samplerID.  Otherwise, processing the measured
   flow data could lead to wrong results.

   At the first glance, choosing an Observation Point that covers the
   entire middlebox looks like an attractive choice.  But this leads to
   ambiguities for all kinds of middleboxes.  Within the middlebox
   properties of packets are modified and it should be clear at a
   Collecting Process whether packets were observed and metered before
   or after modification.  For example, it must be clear whether a



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 22]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   reported source IP address was observed before or after a NAT changed
   it or whether a reported packet count was measured before or after a
   firewall dropped packets.  For this reason, [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info]
   provides Information Elements with prefix "post" for Flow properties
   that are changed within a middlebox.

   If an Observation Point is located inside a middlebox, the middlebox
   must have well defined and well separated internal functions, for
   example a combined NAT and firewall, and the Observation Point should
   be located on a boundary between middlebox functions rather than
   within one of the functions.

7.3.  Reporting Flow-related Middlebox Internals

   While this document recommends IPFIX implementations using
   Observation Points outside of middlebox functions, there are a few
   special cases where reporting flow-related internals of a middlebox
   is of interest.

   For many applications that use traffic measurement results it is
   desirable to get more information than can be derived from just
   observing packets on one side of a middlebox.  If, for example,
   packets are dropped by the middlebox acting as a firewall, NAT or
   traffic shaper, then information about how many observed packets are
   dropped may be of high interest.

   This section gives recommendations on middlebox internal information
   that may be reported if the IPFIX Observation Point is co-located
   with one or more middleboxes.  Since the internal information to be
   reported depends on the kind of middlebox, it is discussed per kind.

   The recommendations cover middleboxes that act per packet and that do
   not modify the application level payload of the packet (except by
   dropping the entire packet) and that do not insert additional packets
   into an application level or transport level traffic stream.

   Covered are the packet level middleboxes of kind 1 - 6, 8 - 10, 21,
   and 22 (according to the enumeration given at the beginning of
   Section Section 7).  Not covered are 7 and 11 - 20.  TCP performance
   enhancing proxies (7) are not covered because they may add ACK
   packets to a TCP connection.

   Still, if possible, IPFIX implementations co-located with uncovered
   middleboxes (i.e. of type 7 or 11 - 20) should follow the
   recommendations given in this section if they can be applied in a way
   that reflects the intention of these recommendations.

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


7.3.1.  Packet Dropping Middleboxes

   If an IPFIX observation point is co-located with one or more
   middleboxes that potentially drop packets, then the corresponding
   IPFIX Exporting Process should be able to report the number of
   packets that were dropped per reported flow.

   Concerned kinds of middleboxes are NAT (1), NAT-PT (2), SOCKS gateway
   (3), packet schedulers (5), IP firewalls (9) and application level
   firewalls (10).

7.3.2.  Middleboxes Changing the DSCP

   If an IPFIX observation point is co-located with one or more
   middleboxes that potentially modify the DiffServ Code Point (DSCP,
   see [RFC2474]) in the IP header, then the corresponding IPFIX
   Exporting Process should be able to report both the observed incoming
   DSCP value and also the DSCP value on the 'other' side of the
   middlebox (if this is a constant value for the particular traffic
   flow).  Related Information Elements specified in
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] are: postIpClassOfService.

   Note that the current IPFIX information model only contains
   Information Elements supporting the case that at the Observation
   Point packets are observed before the DSCP is changed.  Here, the
   relevant Information Elements are ipClassOfService and
   postIpClassOfService, where the latter one reports the value of the
   IP TOS field after the DSCP has been changed.  This value is not
   observed at the observation point.  For the other case where packets
   are observed after the DSCP was changed, there is no Information
   Element in the current information model to report the value that the
   TOS field had before it was changed.  If reporting this value is
   required, then a "pre" Information Element is required, such as, for
   example, preIpClassOfService, or preDiffServCodePoint.  Such
   Information Elements can be specified as enterprise-specific ones or
   a request for adding them to the IPFIX information model can be sent
   to IANA, once IANA has taken over the maintenance of the IPFIX
   Information Element identifier list.

   Note also that a classifier may change the same DSCP value of packets
   from the same flow to different values depending on the packet or
   other conditions.  Also it is possible that packets of a single uni-
   directional arriving flow contain packets with different DSCP values
   that are all set to the same value by the middlebox.  In both cases
   there is a constant value for the DSCP field in the IP packets header
   to be observed on one side of the middlebox, but on the other side
   the value may vary.  In such a case reliable reporting of the DSCP
   value on the 'other' side of the middlebox is not possible by just



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 24]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   reporting a single value.  According to the IPFIX information model
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info], the first value observed for the DSCP is
   reported by the IPFIX protocol in that case.

   This recommendation applies to packet markers (5).

7.3.3.  Middleboxes Changing IP Addresses and Port Numbers

   If an IPFIX Observation Point is co-located with one or more
   middleboxes that potentially modify the:

   o  IP version field,

   o  IP source address header field,

   o  IP destination header field,

   o  Source transport port number,

   o  Destination transport port number

   in one of the headers, then the corresponding IPFIX Exporting Process
   should be able to report the 'translated' value of these fields, as
   far as they have constant values for the particular traffic flow, in
   addition to the observed values of these fields.

   If the changed values are not constant for the particular traffic
   flow but still reporting is desired, then it is recommended that the
   general rule for Information Elements with changing values is
   applied: The reported value is the one that applies to the first
   packet observed for the reported flow.

   Note that the 'translated' value of the fields can be the values
   before or after the translation depending on the Flow direction and
   the location of the observation point with respect to the middlebox.
   We always call the value that is not the one observed at the
   observation point the translated value.

   Note also that a middlebox may change the same port number value of
   packets from the same flow to different values depending on the
   packet or other conditions.  Also it is possible that packets of
   different uni-directional arriving flows with different source/
   destination port number pairs may be mapped to a single flow with a
   single source/destination port number pair by the middlebox.  In both
   cases there is a constant value for the port number pair to be
   observed on one side of the middlebox, but on the other side the
   values may vary.  In such a case reliable reporting of the port
   number pairs on the 'other' side of the middlebox is not possible.



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 25]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   According to the IPFIX information model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info], the
   first value observed for each port number is reported by the IPFIX
   protocol in that case.

   This recommendation applies to NAT (1), NAT-PT (2), SOCKS gateway (3)
   and involuntary packet redirection (21) middleboxes.  It may also be
   applied to anonymizers (22), though it should be noted that this
   carries the risk of losing the effect of anonymisation.


8.  Security Guidelines

8.1.  Introduction to TLS and DTLS for IPFIX implementers

   TLS [RFC4346] and DTLS [RFC4347] are the REQUIRED protocols for
   securing network traffic exported with IPFIX (see Section 11 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol]).  TLS requires a reliable transport
   channel and is selected as the security mechanism for TCP.  DTLS is a
   version of TLS capable of securing datagram traffic and is selected
   for UDP, SCTP and PR-SCTP.

   When mapping TLS terminology used in [RFC4346] to IPFIX terminology,
   keep in mind that the IPFIX Exporting Process, as it is the
   connection initiator, corresponds to the TLS Client, and the IPFIX
   Collecting Process corresponds to the TLS Server.  These terms apply
   only to the bidirectional TLS handshakes done at Transport Session
   Establishment and completion time; aside from TLS connection set up
   between the Exporting Process and the Collecting Process, and
   teardown at the end of the session, the unidirectional flow of
   messages from Exporting Process to Collecting Process operates over
   TLS just as over any other transport layer for IPFIX.

8.2.  X.509-based Identity Verification for IPFIX over TLS or DTLS

   When using TLS or DTLS to secure an IPFIX Transport Session, the
   Collecting Process and Exporting Process must use strong mutual
   authentication.  In other words, each IPFIX endpoint must have its
   own X.509 certificate [RFC3280] and private key, and the Collecting
   Process, which acts as the TLS or DTLS Server, must send a
   Certificate Request to the Exporting Process to the Exporting Process
   during the TLS handshake, and fail to establish a session if the
   Exporting Process does not present a valid certificate.

   Each of the Exporting Process and the Collecting Process must verify
   the identity of its peer against a set of authorized peers.  This may
   be done by configuring a set of authorized distinguished names and
   comparing the peer certificate's subject distinguished name against
   each name in the set.  However, if a private certificate authority



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 26]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   (CA) is used to sign the certificates identifying the Collecting
   Processes and Exporting Processes, and the set of certificates signed
   by that private CA may be restricted to those identifying peers
   authorized to communicate with each other, it is sufficient to merely
   verify that the peer's certificate is issued by this private CA.

   When verifying the identity of its peer, an IPFIX Exporting Process
   or Collecting Process must verify that the peer certificate's subject
   common name or subjectAltName extension dNSName matches the fully-
   qualified domain name (FQDN) of the peer.  This involves retrieving
   the expected domain name from the peer certificate and the address of
   the peer, then verifying that the two match via a DNS lookup.  Such
   verification should require both that forward lookups (FQDN to peer
   address) and reverse lookups (peer address to FQDN) match.  In
   deployments absent DNS infrastructure, it is acceptable to represent
   the FQDN as an IPv4 dotted-quad or a textual IPv6 address as in
   [RFC1924].

8.3.  Implementing IPFIX over TLS over TCP

   Of the security solutions specified for IPFIX, TLS over TCP is as of
   this writing the most mature and widely implemented.  Until stable
   implementations of DTLS over SCTP are widely available (see
   Section 8.5, below), it is recommended that applications requiring
   secure transport for IPFIX messages use TLS over TCP.

   When using TLS over TCP, IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting
   Processes should behave in all other aspects as if using TCP as the
   transport protocol; especially as regards the handling of templates
   and template withdrawals.

8.4.  Implementing IPFIX over DTLS over UDP

   An implementation of the DTLS protocol version 1, described in
   [RFC4347] and required to secure IPFIX over UDP, is available in
   OpenSSL [OPENSSL] as of version 0.9.8.  However, DTLS support is as
   of this writing under active development and certain implementations
   might be unstable.  We recommend extensive testing of DTLS based
   IPFIX implementations to build confidence in the DTLS stack over
   which your implementation runs.

   When using DTLS over UDP, IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting
   Processes should behave in all other aspects as if using UDP as the
   transport protocol; especially as regards the handling of templates
   and template timeouts.

   Note that the selection of IPFIX message sizes for DTLS over UDP must
   account for overhead per packet introduced by the DTLS layer.

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


8.5.  Implementing IPFIX over DTLS over SCTP

   As of this writing, there is no publicly available implementation of
   DTLS over SCTP as described in [RFC4347] and
   [I-D.tuexen-dtls-for-sctp].

   When using DTLS over SCTP, IPFIX Exporting Processes and Collecting
   Processes should behave in all other aspects as if using SCTP as the
   transport protocol; especially as regards the handling of templates,
   the use of reliable transport for template and scope information.

   An implementation of the DTLS protocol version 1, described in
   [RFC4347] and required to secure IPFIX over SCTP, is available in
   OpenSSL [OPENSSL] as of version 0.9.8.  However, DTLS support is as
   of this writing under active development and certain implementations
   might be unstable.  We recommend extensive testing of DTLS based
   IPFIX implementations to build confidence in the DTLS stack over
   which your implementation runs.


9.  Extending the Information Model

   IPFIX supports two sets of Information Elements: IETF specified
   Information Elements and enterprise-specific Information Elements.
   New Information Elements can be added to both sets as described in
   this section.  If an Information Element is considered of general
   interest, it should be added to the set of IETF specified Information
   Elements that is maintained by IANA.

   Alternatively, private enterprises can define proprietary Information
   Elements for internal purposes.  There are several potential reasons
   for doing so.  For example, the Information Element might only relate
   to proprietary features of a device or protocol of the enterprise.
   Also pre-standard product delivery or commercially sensitive product
   features might cause the need for enterprise-specific Information
   Elements.

   The Information Model [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] document contains an XML-
   based specification of Template, abstract data types and IPFIX
   Information Elements, which may be used to create consistent machine-
   readable extensions to the IPFIX information model.  This description
   can be used for automatically checking syntactic correctness of the
   specification of IPFIX Information Elements and for generating code
   that deals with processing IPFIX Information Elements.

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


9.1.  Adding new IETF specified Information Elements

   New IPFIX Information Elements that are considered to be of general
   interest should be added to the set of IETF specified Information
   Elements that is maintained by IANA.

   The introduction of new Information Elements in the IANA registry is
   subject to expert review.  As described in section 7.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] an expert review is performed by one of a group
   of experts designated by an IETF Operations and Management Area
   Director.  The experts will initially be drawn from the Working Group
   Chairs and document editors of the IPFIX and PSAMP Working Groups.
   The group of experts must double check the Information Elements
   definitions with already defined Information Elements for
   completeness, accuracy, redundancy, and correct naming following the
   naming conventions in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] section 2.3.

   The specification of new IPFIX Information Elements must use the
   template specified in [I-D.ietf-ipfix-info] section 2.1 and must be
   published using a well established and persistent publication medium.

9.2.  Adding enterprise-specific Information Elements

   Enterprises or other organizations holding a registered SMI network
   management private enterprise code number can specify enterprise-
   specific Information Elements.  Their identifiers can be chosen
   arbitrarily within the range of 1-32767 and have to be coupled with a
   Private Enterprise Identifier [PEN].  Enterprise identifiers MUST be
   registered as SMI network management private enterprise code numbers
   with IANA.  The registry can be found at
   http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers.


10.  Common Implementation Mistakes

   The issues listed in this section were identified during
   implementation and interoperability testing.  They do not stem from
   insufficient clarity in the protocol, but each of these was an actual
   mistake made in a tested IPFIX implementation.  They are listed here
   for the convenience of future implementers.

10.1.  IPFIX and Netflow version 9

   A large group of mistakes stems from the fact that many implementers
   started implementing IPFIX from an existing version of NetFlow
   version 9 [RFC3954].  Despite their similarity, the two protocols
   differ in many aspects.  We list here some of the most important
   differences..



Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 29]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   o  Transport protocol: NetFlow version 9 initially ran over UDP while
      IPFIX must have a congestion aware transport protocol.  IPFIX
      specifies PR-SCTP as its mandatory protocol, while TCP and UDP are
      optional.

   o  IPFIX differentiates between IETF and non-IETF defined Information
      Elements.  Non-IETF Information Elements can be specified by
      coupling the non IETF Information Element identifier with an
      Enterprise ID (corresponding to the vendor that defined the
      Information Element).

   o  Option Templates: in IPFIX, an Option Template must have a scope
      and the scope is not allowed to be of length zero.  The NetFlow
      version 9 specifications [RFC3954] don't specify that the scope
      must not be of length zero.

   Message header:

   o  Set ID: Even if the packet headers are different between IPFIX and
      NetFlow version 9, some of the fields are used in both of them.
      The difference between the two protocols is in the values that
      these fields can assume.  A typical example is the Set ID values:
      the Set ID values of 0 and 1 are used in NetFlow version 9, while
      they are not used in IPFIX.

   o  Length field: in NetFlow version 9, this field (called count)
      contains the number of Records.  In IPFIX, it indicates the total
      length of the IPFIX message, measured in octets (including message
      header and Set(s)).

   o  Timestamp: NetFlow version 9 has an additional timestamp:
      sysUpTime.  It indicates the time in milliseconds since the last
      reboot of the Exporting Process.

   o  The version number is different.  NetFlow version 9 uses the
      version number 9 while IPFIX uses the version number 10.

10.2.  Padding of the Data Set

   [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol] specifies that the Exporting Process MAY
   insert some octets for set padding to align Data Sets within a
   Message.  The padding length must be shorter than any allowable
   Record in that set.

   It is important to respect this limitation: if the padding length is
   equal to or longer than the length of the shortest Record, it will be
   interpreted as another Record.




Boschi, et al.            Expires May 20, 2008                 [Page 30]

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   An alternative is to use the paddingOctets Information Element in the
   Template definition.

10.3.  Field ID Numbers

   Information Element numbers in IPFIX have the range 0-32767 (0 -
   0x7FFF).  Information Element numbers outside this range (i.e., with
   the high bit set) are taken to be enterprise-specific Information
   Elements, which have an additional four-byte Private Enterprise
   Number following the Information Element number and length.
   Inadvertently setting the high bit of the Information Element number
   by selecting a number out of this range will therefore cause template
   scanning errors.

10.4.  Template ID Numbers

   Template IDs are generated as required by the Exporting Process.
   When the same set of Information Elements is exported at different
   times, the corresponding Template is usually identified by different
   Template IDs.  Similarly, if multiple co-existing Templates are
   composed of the same set of Information Elements, they are also
   identified by different Template IDs.  The collecting process does
   not know in advance which Template ID a particular Template will use.


11.  Security Considerations

   This document describes the implementation guidelines of IPFIX.  The
   security requirements for the IPFIX target applications are addressed
   in the IPFIX requirements draft [RFC3917].  These requirements are
   considered for the specification of the IPFIX protocol, for which a
   security considerations section exits [I-D.ietf-ipfix-protocol].

   Section 7 recommends that IPFIX Exporting Processes report internals
   about middleboxes.  These internals may be security-relevant and the
   reported information needs to be protected appropriately for reasons
   given below.

   Reporting of packets dropped by firewalls and other packet-dropping
   middleboxes carries the risk that this information can be used by
   attackers for analyzing the configuration of the middlebox and for
   developing attacks against it.  Address translation may be used for
   hiding the network structure behind an address translator.  If an
   IPFIX Exporting Process reports the translations performed by an
   address translator, then parts of the network structure may be
   revealed.  If an IPFIX Exporting Process reports the translations
   performed by an anonymizer, the main function of the anonymizer may
   be compromised.

Internet-Draft       IPFIX Implementation Guidelines       November 2007


   Note that there exist vulnerabilities in DTLS over SCTP as specified
   in the IPFIX Protocol, such that a third party could cause messages
   to be undetectably lost, or an SCTP Association to shut down.  These
   vulnerabilities are addressed by [I-D.tuexen-dtls-for-sctp]; however,
   it is unclear whether initial OpenSSL-based implementations of DTLS
   over SCTP will contain the required fixes.  DTLS over SCTP should be
   used with caution in production environments until these issues are
   completely addressed.
