    Negotiating the Maximum Number of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) Subflows
                  draft-boucadair-mptcp-max-subflow-02

Abstract

   This document specifies an experimental Multipath TCP (MPTCP) option
   that is meant to negotiate the maximum number of subflows that can be
   established and maintained for a given MPTCP connection.  The purpose
   is to minimize any possible performance degradation that can be
   induced by a possibly large number of establishment requests for
   additional subflows if the remote endpoint is not appropriately
   dimensioned to handle such requests.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies a Multipath TCP (MPTCP) [RFC6824] option that
   is meant to indicate to a remote peer the maximum number of subflows
   that can be established within a single MPTCP connection.  If the
   remote peer honors the indication provided in this option, any
   performance degradation induced by a possibly abusive setup of
   additional subflows that exceed the said maximum becomes unlikely.

   This option mainly targets MPTCP deployments within a single
   administrative domain such as those MPTCP designs meant to achieve
   load-balancing, for example.  The use of this option contributes to
   the harmonization of node configuration within an administrative
   domain, so that an optimal number of subflows is maintained by
   involved nodes independently of their actual performance
   capabilities.  This option can be used in other deployment scenarios.
   It is out of scope of this document to identify what are such
   scenarios.

   Section 3.4 of [I-D.ietf-mptcp-experience] includes a discussion on
   the MPTCP session manager issues.

1.1.  Experiment Goals

   Experiments based upon the MPTCP option described in this document
   are meant to help operators optimize their MPTCP design and
   operational procedures, by tweaking some MPTCP parameters such as the
   number of subflows to be associated with a given MPTCP connection.
   Experimenting with this MPTCP option should also help assess whether
   this option can be used to propagate MPTCP-related optimization
   parameters (derived from the number of concurrent subflows associated
   to each MPTCP connection) that can be configured in a node that is
   responsible for aggregating MPTCP connections established with
   upstream nodes.

2.  Maximum Subflows MPTCP Option (MP_MAXSUBFLOW)

   The MP_MAXSUBFLOW option (Figure 1) follows the shared experimental
   format defined in [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis].

        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

       |     Kind      |    Length     |Subtype| Flags | Experiment Id |
       +---------------+---------------+-------+-------+---------------+
       |                        Maximum Subflows                       |
       +---------------+-----------------------------------------------+

                          Figure 1: Option Format

   The meaning of "Kind", "Length", "Subtype", and "Flags" (especially
   'S' and 'U' flags) are exactly the same as defined in Section 3.7 of
   [I-D.ietf-mptcp-rfc6824bis].

   Experiment ID MUST be set to 0xAA (see Section 5).

   The "Maximum Subflows" field indicates the maximum number of
   concurrent subflows that can be maintained by a given MPTCP endpoint
   for each MPTCP connection established by or with this endpoint.  The
   value of this field MUST be strictly greater than zero.

3.  Behavior

   The MP_MAXSUBFLOW option may be used by a TCP endpoint to indicate to
   its corresponding peer the maximum number of subflows that it can
   maintain per MPTCP connection.

   How an MPTCP endpoint determines the maximum number of concurrent
   subflows it supports (i.e., the value it indicates in an
   MP_MAXSUBFLOW option) is implementation-specific.  For example, an

   implementation may support a configuration parameter and/or use a
   default value.

   If two peers (T1 and T2) indicate the maximum number of concurrent
   subflows per connection they can maintain, then they MUST NOT
   maintain more than "MIN(MAX_SUBFLOW(T1), MAX_SUBFLOW(T2))" concurrent
   subflows.

   The absence of the MP_MAXSUBFLOW option in an MPTCP control message
   issued by a MPTCP endpoint is an indication that this endpoint can
   instantiate any number of subflows per MPTCP connection.

4.  Security Considerations

   MPTCP-related security considerations are documented in [RFC6824] and
   [RFC7430].

   Establishing a large number of subflows may exhaust the resources of
   an MPTCP implementation (especially, MPTCP servers).  MPTCP
   implementations SHOULD rate-limit the number of concurrent subflows
   per MPTCP connection.  This policy is meant to prevent DoS attacks
   that would result in creating additional subflows to exhaust the
   remote peer resources (typically, an MPTCP server).

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document uses the experiment Id (0xAA).  This Id is not
   registered yet given that no registry is maintained by IANA for this
   purpose.
