Abstract
   
   This memo defines and extension to the SIEVE mail filtering language
   (RFC 3028) for accessing mailbox and server annotations (variables).


1.   Introduction
   
   This memo defines and extension to the SIEVE mail filtering language
   (RFC 3028) for accessing mailbox and server annotations (variables).
   This allows to customize Sieve engine behaviour based on variables
   set using [METADATA], [ACAP], [LDAP], etc.

   An implementation of this extension doesn't need to implement
   [METADATA] or even [IMAP], however it has to use the same data model
   as described in Section 3 of [METADATA]. For example, it should be
   possible to implement the "servermetadata" extension defined in this
   document by making Sieve engine read values from user's LDAP entry.


2.   Conventions Used in this Document
   
   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in
   this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [KEYWORDS].
   
   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1.

   This document is written with an assumption that readers are familiar
   with data model and terms defined in Section 3 of [METADATA].


3.  mailbox and mboxmetadata Sieve extensions

3.1.  Test mailbox_exists

      Usage:   mailbox_exists <mailbox-names: string-list>

   The "mailbox_exists" test is true if the mailbox listed in the
   mailbox-names argument exist in the mailstore.
   Note that this test MUST return false for a mailbox which exists
   but is not accessible (for example due to access control
   restrictions) to the user in whose context the Sieve script runs.

   The capability string for use with the require command is "mailbox"
   or "mboxmetadata".

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine
    also supports "reject" [REJECT] and "fileinto" [SIEVE]. However
    these extensions are not required in order to implement the
    "mailbox".

             require ["fileinto", "reject", "mailbox"];
             if mailbox_exists "Partners" {
                fileinto "Partners";
             } else {
                reject "This message was not accepted by the Mailstore";
             }


3.2 ":create" argument to "fileinto" command

     Usage: fileinto [:create] <mailbox: string>

   If the optional :create argument is specified with "fileinto"
   it instructs Sieve interpreter to create the specified mailbox
   before attempting to deliver the message into the specified
   mailbox. If the mailbox already exists, this argument is ignored.
   Failure to create the specified mailbox is considered to be
   an error.

   The capability string for use with the :create parameter is
   "mailbox".


3.3  Test metadata

      Usage:   metadata [MATCH-TYPE] [COMPARATOR]
               [":any" / ":shared" / ":private"] <mailbox: string>
               <annotation-name: string> <key-list: string-list>

   This test retrieves the "value.priv" or "value.shared" of the mailbox
   annotation "annotation-name" for the mailbox "mailbox"
   [METADATA]. The retrieved value is compared to the
   "key-list". The test returns true if the annotation (of the specified
   type) exists and its value matches any of the keys.

   The default annotation type is ":any", which correspond to both
   "value.priv" and "value.shared" annotation values [METADATA],
   i.e. the metadata test is true if either value matches any of the
   keys. The annotation type ":private" corresponds to "value.priv" and
   the annotation type ":shared" corresponds to "value.shared".
   
   The default match type is ":is". The default comparator is
   "i;ascii-casemap".

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "mboxmetadata".

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine
    also supports the "vacation" [VACATION] extension. However
    this extension is not required in order to implement
    the "mboxmetadata" extension.

        require ["mboxmetadata", "vacation"];

        if metadata :is :private "INBOX"
           "/vendor/isode/auto-replies" "on" {
            set "notif_uri" "${0}";
            vacation text:
        I'm away on holidays till March 2008.
        Expect a delay.
        .
        }


3.4  Test metadata_exists

      Usage:   metadata_exists [":any" / ":shared" / ":private"]
               <mailbox: string>
               <annotation-names: string-list>

   Usage:   exists <header-names: string-list>

   The "metadata_exists" test is true if the annotations of the
   specified type, with names listed in the annotation-names argument
   exist for the specified mailbox. All of the annotations must exist
   or the test is false.

   The default annotation type is ":any", which correspond to both
   "value.priv" and "value.shared" annotation values [METADATA],
   i.e. the metadata_exists test is true if either value exists.
   The annotation type ":private" corresponds to "value.priv" and the
   annotation type ":shared" corresponds to "value.shared".

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "mboxmetadata".


4.  servermetadata Sieve extension

4.1  Test server_metadata

      Usage:   server_metadata [MATCH-TYPE] [COMPARATOR]
               [":any" / ":shared" / ":private"]
               <annotation-name: string> <key-list: string-list>

   This test retrieves the "value.priv" or "value.shared" of the server
   annotation "annotation-name" [METADATA]. The retrieved value
   is compared to the "key-list". The test returns true if the
   annotation (of the specified type) exists and its value matches any
   of the keys.

   The default annotation type is ":any", which correspond to both
   "value.priv" and "value.shared" annotation values [METADATA],
   i.e. the server_metadata test is true if either value matches any of
   the keys. The annotation type ":private" corresponds to "value.priv"
   and the annotation type ":shared" corresponds to "value.shared".
   
   The default match type is ":is". The default comparator is
   "i;ascii-casemap".

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "servermetadata".

   Example: The following example assumes that the Sieve engine
    also supports "variables" [Variables] and "enotify" [NOTIFY] and
    "envelope" [SIEVE] extensions. However these extensions are not
    required in order to implement the "servermetadata".
    
        require ["enotify", "servermetadata", "variables", "envelope"];

        if server_metadata :matches :private
           "/vendor/isode/notification-uri" "*" {
            set "notif_uri" "${0}";
        }

        if not string :is "${notif_uri}" "none" {
            # :matches is used to get the MAIL FROM address
            if envelope :all :matches "from" "*" {
                set "env_from" " [really: ${1}]";
            }

            # :matches is used to get the value of the Subject header
            if header :matches "Subject" "*" {
                set "subject" "${1}";
            }

            # :matches is used to get the address from the From header
            if address :matches :all "from" "*" {
                set "from_addr" "${1}";
            }

            notify :message "${from_addr}${env_from}: ${subject}"
                   "${notif_uri}";
        }


4.2  Test server_metadata_exists

      Usage:   server_metadata_exists
               [":any" / ":shared" / ":private"]
               <annotation-names: string-list>

   Usage:   exists <header-names: string-list>

   The "server_metadata_exists" test is true if server annotations of
   the specified type, with names listed in the annotation-names
   argument exist. All of the annotations must exist or the test
   is false.

   The default annotation type is ":any", which correspond to both
   "value.priv" and "value.shared" annotation values [METADATA],
   i.e. the server_metadata_exists test is true if either value exists.
   The annotation type ":private" corresponds to "value.priv" and the
   annotation type ":shared" corresponds to "value.shared".

   The capability string for use with the require command is
   "servermetadata".


5.   Security Considerations

   Extensions defined in this document deliberately don't provide a way
   to modify per-user (per-server) or per-mailbox data.

   A failure to retrieve data due to server storing annotations being
   down or otherwise inaccessible may alter the result of Sieve
   processing. So implementations SHOULD treat temporary failures to
   retrieve annotations in the same manner they would treat temporary
   failures to retrieve the whole Sieve script.

   Protocols/APIs used to retrive annotations MUST provide the same
   level of confidentiality as protocols/APIs used to retrieve Sieve
   scripts.


6.   IANA Considerations
   
   IANA is requested to add the following registrations to the list of
   Sieve extensions:
