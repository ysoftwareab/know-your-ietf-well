Abstract

   This document defines extensions to the vCard data format for
   representing and exchanging contact information used to implement the
   Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
   operational profile for the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP).
   The property and parameter defined here are used to add values to
   RDAP responses that are consistent with ICANN policies.

1.  Introduction

   The Temporary Specification for gTLD Registration Data [1] was
   published by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Named and Numbers
   (ICANN) in 2018.  The Temporary Specification includes requirements
   that cannot currently be met by the Registration Data Access Protocol
   (RDAP, [RFC7483]) without extending the underlying vCard [RFC6350]
   specification used to represent RDAP entity objects.  This document
   includes specifications for an additional vCard property and an
   additional vCard parameter to meet the requirements of the Temporary
   Specification.

1.1.  Terminology Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Syntax specifications shown here use the augmented Backus-Naur Form
   (ABNF) as described in [RFC5234], and are specified as in the base
   vCard specification [RFC6350].

2.  vCard Extensions: Properties

   This document describes one new vCard extension property.

2.1.  Property: CONTACT-URI

   Namespace:

   Property name: CONTACT-URI

   Purpose: RDAP entity information can be redacted under certain
   circumstances (e.g., privacy).  The Temporary Specification requires
   that RDAP entity objects representing "Registrant", "Admin", and
   "Tech" contacts contain an email address or a location for a web form
   to facilitate email communication with the relevant contact in a way
   that does not identify the associated individual.  The CONTACT-URI
   property can be used to include URIs representing an email address or
   a location for a web form.

   Value type: A single URI value.

   Cardinality: *

   Property parameters: PREF

   Description: At least one "mailto", "http", or "https" URI value MUST
   be provided.  Additional CONTACT-URI properties MAY be provided to
   describe other contact methods.  If multiple CONTACT-URI properties
   are used, the vCard PREF parameter MUST be used to describe the most
   preferred property as described in Section 5.3 of RFC 6350 [RFC6350].

   Format definition:

      CONTACT-URI-param = "VALUE=uri" / pref-param ; pref-param from
      [RFC6350]
      CONTACT-URI-value = uri ; uri from [RFC3986]

   Examples:

      CONTACT-URI:https://contact.example.com
      CONTACT-URI;PREF=1:mailto:contact@example.com

3.  vCard Extensions: Parameters

   This document describes one new vCard extension parameter.

Internet-Draft         ICANN RDAP vCard Extensions            April 2019


3.1.  Parameter: CC

   Namespace:

   Parameter name: CC

   Purpose: ICANN requires the use of ISO 3166 [ISO.3166.1988] two-
   letter codes, not "country names", in RDAP entity responses.  This
   parameter is used to extend the ADR property described in
   Section 6.3.1 of RFC 6350 [RFC6350].

   Description: This parameter contains the ISO 3166 [ISO.3166.1988]
   2-character country code associated with the "country name" ADR
   component described in Section 6.3.1 of RFC 6350 [RFC6350].

   Format definition:

      CC-param = "CC=" 2ALPHA

   Examples:

      ADR;TYPE=work;CC=US:;;54321 Oak St;Reston;VA;20190;USA
      ADR;TYPE=home;CC=US:;;12345 Elm St;Reston;VA;20190;USA

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the vCard Properties
   registry defined in Section 10.3.1 of RFC 6350 [RFC6350].

   Namespace:

   Property: CONTACT-URI

   Reference: RFCXXXX (this RFC), Section 2.1

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the vCard Parameters
   registry defined in Section 10.3.2 of RFC 6350 [RFC6350].

   Namespace:

   Property: CC

   Reference: RFCXXXX (this RFC), Section 3.1

5.  Security Considerations

   The CONTACT-URI value is purposefully intended to be a publicly
   visible contact reference, and as such, it cannot require
   confidentiality protection.  There are, however, privacy implications
   in the choice of a URI scheme for the web form contact method.  An
   "https" URI value can be used to indicate support for confidentiality
   protection for connections to the server that publishes the web form.
   This document presents no other security considerations beyond those
   described in Section 9 of the base vCard specification [RFC6350].
