Abstract 
    
   This draft describes extensions to the Link Management Protocol (LMP) 
   for use in flooding-based fault notification in optical networks.  We 
   focus on networks that use a common control plane (e.g, Generalized 
   Multi-Protocol Label Switching or GMPLS).  These extensions implement 
   the Fault Notification Protocol, a flooding-based approach to 
   notifying faults to nodes in the network.  We motivate the use of LMP 
   extensions for flooding, define message formats and explain the 
   communication messages that occur using LMP.

Overview 
    
   This draft describes extensions to the Link Management Protocol (LMP) 
   to implement the flooding-based Fault Notification Protocol in 
   optical networks.  We make the case in [2] for a flooding-based 
   approach to the notification phase because it has the potential to 
   offer speed and flexibility advantages over using RSVP-TE (or CR-LDP) 
   signaling for notification.  The focus in this draft is to extend LMP 
   to include fault notification; we argue that this is a good 
   implementation of the protocol because fault management is already 
   one of the features of LMP and we can make use of many of its 
   protocol objects in implementing our scheme. 
    
   Currently, there are several Internet Drafts related to recovery in 
   networks featuring a GMPLS control-plane.  They cover the topics of 
   terminology [3], requirements [4], functional specification [5], and 
   mechanisms analysis [6].  The requirements for control plane-based 
   recovery were found to fall into four main categories: 
    
      o Meeting timing requirements 
      o Efficient usage of data plane resources 
      o Efficient usage of control plane resources 
      o Supporting flexible design of recovery schemes

   That controlled flooding meets the requirements on fault notification 
   mechanisms and has beneficial side effects over notification via 
   GMPLS signaling is discussed in [4].  Flooding-based notification is 
   also appropriate for shared mesh-based (M:N) recovery schemes that 
   are promoted for their resource efficiency and flexibility.  Generic 
   mechanisms for implementing a Fault Notification Protocol are 
   proposed in [2]. 
     
   In this draft, we describe the implementation of the protocol and 
   provide the necessary extensions to LMP message formats and data 
   object definitions.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in [7]. 
    
1.2 
 Glossary of Terms Used 
    
   In addition to the terminology for GMPLS-based recovery that is 
   documented in [3], this draft uses the following acronyms: 
    
      o  GMPLS:   Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching [8]  
      o  LMP:     Link Management Protocol [9]  
      o  LSP:     Label Switched Path   
      o  NMS:     Network Management System 
      o  RSVP-TE: Resource Reservation Protocol-Traffic Engineering [10]  
    
    
2. 
Flooding-based Fault Notification 
    
   In a flooding-based fault notification approach, we have two choices 
   for implementation.  One would be to use IGP flooding (i.e. OSPF and 
   IS-IS), while the other is an implementation specific to fault 
   notification.  In case of IGP flooding, timing requirements may not 
   be satisfied because of the use of a pacing timer for IGP flooding.  
   To address this point, the latter option is more suitable to notify 
   nodes in a network of a fault.  LMP is one such candidate for 
   implementing the flooding-based fault notification since it already 
   includes fault management functions such as fault localization.  For 
   this purpose, we believe that LMP has the ability to detect a fault 
   very quickly. 
    
   Fault notification using LMP is done by the control plane, which 
   controls data plane nodes such as Optical Cross Connects (OXC).  LMP 
   flooding is done in the same way as IGP flooding.  In the case where 
   LMP extensions are used, notification may be done through the control

   channel, which is set up using the control channel management 
   function of LMP. 
    
    
3. 
Fault Recovery Scenario 
    
   In this section, a fault recovery scenario is described based on 
   shared mesh recovery.  Every node maintains adjacency with each of 
   its neighbors via at least one LMP control channel.  A pre-planned 
   recovery path table is configured using extended GMPLS signaling 
   messages or through a Network Management System (NMS). 
    
   The recovery path table is a table to recovery paths that a node is 
   responsible for, together with information on the resources that each 
   recovery path is using, in addition to fault node/link IDs.  For 
   example, the recovery path table may consist of fault node ID, fault 
   link ID, input port, input label (i.e. lambda), output port and 
   output label. 
    
   When a failure occurs, the following procedure is carried out: 
    
   1. A downstream node close to the failure detects it.  This node is 
      called the detecting node.  If the path is bi-directional, an 
      upstream node also detects it.  The detecting node should report 
      the detection of the failure (and becomes the reporting node). 
    
   2. The reporting node sends unicast FaultNotify messages (defined in 
      section 4.1) to all its immediate neighbor nodes.  The node keeps 
      sending unicast FaultNotify messages periodically to each of its 
      neighbors until it receives FaultNotifyAck messages (as defined 
      in section 4.2) from its neighbors, or a timer to retry sending 
      expires.  A FaultNotify message contains the node ID of the 
      reporting node, the link ID of the failed link and a sequence 
      Number.  The message may optionally contain a TTL, failed 
      wavelength ID, or failed SRLG ID. 
 
   3. A neighbor node receives a FaultNotify message with failure data 
      and sequence number. 
 
   4. The receiving node checks that it has not yet received the message 
      about this failure from another neighboring node.  For this 
      purpose, it searches a database indexed on the failure data and 
      sequence number.  The database stores the failure data and 
      sequence numbers from the received messages. 
       
      a. If the receiving node has not yet received the message about 
         this failure, it adds the failure data and sequence number 
         into the database.  The node then sends unicast FaultNotify

         messages to all its neighbors, except the node that sent it 
         the message. 
      b. If it has already received the message about this failure, go 
         to 6. 
    
   5. The receiving node possibly activates one or more recovery paths 
      according to a pre-planned recovery table based on the failure 
      data. 
    
   6. The receiving node sends back FaultNotifyAck message to the node 
      that sent the FaultNotify message. 
    
   [Optional]: If the receiving node has activated one or more recovery 
   paths, it sends a RecoveryCompleteNotify message to either the egress 
   nodes of the recovery LSPs or to the NMS.  It continues sending 
   RecoveryCompleteNotify messages periodically until it receives a 
   RecoveryCompleteNotifyAck message or a timer to retry sending 
   expires. 
    
   [Optional]: The node at the egress of the protection path, or the NMS 
   sends back a RecoveryCompleteNotifyAck message to the originator of 
   the RecoveryCompleteNotify message.

                      Figure 1: Shared Mesh Recovery 
    
    
   Figure 1 shows an example of shared mesh-based recovery.  One working 
   path, W-LSP1, runs from R1 to R4 via R2 and R3, and another working 
   path, W-LSP2, runs from R7 to R10 via R8 and R9.  R1 can provide user 
   traffic protection by creating a backup LSP that merges with the 
   working LSP at R4.  We refer to the LSP R-LSP1 [R1->R5->R6->R4] as 
   the recovery LSP of W-LSP1.  In the same manner, we refer to the LSP 
   R-LSP2 [R7->R8->R9->R10] as the recovery LSP of W-LSP2. 
    
   In this situation, if it can be assumed that multiple failures do not 
   occur at the same time, the resources for recovering the working LSPs 
   can be shared.  In other words, the link between R5 and R6 can be 
   shared between the recovery LSP1 and recovery LSP2.  By setting up

   these recovery LSPs, the spare/working capacity ratio in the network 
   can be reduced, thereby increasing network efficiency. 
    
   When a failure occurs at a link between R8 and R9 on the working LSP 
   W-LSP2, the endpoint nodes (both R8 and R9) of the link will detect 
   the failure (if the link is bi-directional).  Then, the detecting 
   nodes start sending FaultNotify messages.  Node R9 sends these 
   messages to R6 and R10.  When R6 and R10 receive FaultNotify 
   messages, they send back a FaultNotifyAck message to the sending node 
   R9.  In the same manner, they send FaultNotify messages to their 
   immediate neighbors. 
    
   The FaultNotify message includes information regarding the failure 
   such as FAULT_ID, etc.  When nodes on the recovery LSPs receive the 
   FaultNotify message, they activate the recovery path.  In this 
   example, R-LSP2 is activated and R7 switches W-LSP2 traffic to be 
   carried by R-LSP2.  R10, in its turn, merges R-LSP2 to the original 
   route.  As a result, traffic will follow the path [R7->R5->R6->R10]. 
    
    
4. 
Additional LMP Message Formats 
    
   LMP is a good candidate protocol to use and extend for purposes of 
   fault notification.  Two messages (FaultNotify and FaultNotifyAck) 
   need to be defined.  Furthermore, most of the necessary data objects 
   are already defined in LMP [9]. 
    
4.1 
  FaultNotify Message (Msg Type = TBD) 
    
   <FaultNotify Message> ::=    <Common Header> <MESSAGE_ID> 
                                [<TTL>] <FAULT_ID> <LOCAL_NODE_ID>  
                                {<LINK_ID> [<CHANNEL_STATUS>] ...} 
   or 
     
   <FaultNotify Message> ::=    <Common Header> <MESSAGE_ID> 
                                <TTL> <FAULT_ID> [<SRLG ID> ...] 
    
4.2 
  FaultNotifyAck Message (Msg Type = TBD) 
    
   <FaultNotifyAck Message> ::= <Common Header> <MESSAGE_ID_ACK> 
    
   The contents of the MESSAGE_ID_ACK object MUST be obtained from the 
   FaultNotify message being acknowledged. 
    
    
5. 
Additional LMP Object Definitions 
    
   The formats for the Common Header at the beginning of LMP messages 
   and the LMP objects used to build the messages are defined in [9].

         draft-soumiya-lmp-fault-notification-ext-01         June 2003 
 
 
   That document also defines the MESSAGE_ID, MESSAGE_ID_ACK, 
   LOCAL_NODE_ID, and CHANNEL_STATUS data objects used in our extended 
   messages.  The SRLG_ID data object is defined in [11].  This leaves 
   us to define data objects for TTL and FAULT_ID. 
      
5.1 
 TTL Class (Class = TBD) 
    
   o  C-Type = 1, Time to Live (= Hop Count) 
    
   0                   1                   2                   3  
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |     TTL       |                    Reserved                   |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+ 
    
   TTL:  8 bits 
    
      This is an unsigned integer to indicate the remaining hop count 
      value.  A node receiving a FaultNotify message having a TTL of 
      zero MUST silently discard the message. 
    
   This object is non-negotiable. 
        
5.2 
 FAULT_ID Class (Class = TBD) 
    
   o  C-Type = 1, Failure Identifier 
    
   0                   1                   2                   3  
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
   |           Reserved            |         FaultId               |  
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+  
    
   FaultId:  16 bits 
    
      This MUST be a node-wide unique unsigned integer.  The FaultId 
      identifies the sequence of failures.  A node increases the value 
      when it detects a failure. 
    
   This object is non-negotiable. 
    
    
6. 
Priority-Based Recovery 
    
   Fault recovery schemes typically assume single failure events.  
   However, multiple failures may occur in some short time interval.   
   Protection against occurrences of failure scenarios requires large 
   amounts of spare capacity.  Ideally, the network should at least 
   recover some of the working paths in this situation.

         draft-soumiya-lmp-fault-notification-ext-01         June 2003 
 
 
    
   For example, consider figure 2, when two failures occur at the same 
   time.  One failure is a link failure between R3 and R4, and the other 
   failure is a link failure between R7 and R8.  In this example, R4 
   detects a failure and sends a fault notification message to R6.  At 
   almost the same time, R8 detects a failure and sends a message to R5.  
   At R6, a recovery path switches traffic from R6 to R4 because the 
   fault notification message is for W-LSP1.  On the other hand, at R5, 
   a recovery path switches traffic from R5 to R6 because the fault 
   notification message is for W-LSP2.  As a result, an invalid recovery 
   path is set to follow [R7->R5->R6->R4]. 
    
    
                         [R1]---[R2]---[R3]-X-[R4] 
                           \                  / 
                           [R5]-------------[R6] 
                           /  \           /   \ 
                        [R7]-X-[R8]---[R9]---[R10] 
    
     Working LSP1:  [R1->R2->R3->R4]   Working LSP2:  [R7->R8->R9->R10] 
     Recovery LSP1: [R1->R5->R6->R4]   Recovery LSP2: [R7->R5->R6->R10] 
    
                   Figure 2: Multiple failure scenario. 
    
    
   Priority-based control is an effective solution for the case of 
   recovering specific working paths under the condition of multiple 
   failures.  In the above example, if the priority of W-LSP1 is higher 
   than W-LSP2, then the fault notification messages for W-LSP1 are 
   preferred.  In other words, the system checks the priority of the 
   protection path and changes the priority setting.  In that case, the 
   switching traffic from R6 to R4 takes precedence over switching 
   traffic from R6 to R10.  By adopting priority-based control, such 
   behavior can be avoided.  As a result, the high priority recovery 
   path is activated.  Priority in general should be set according to a 
   network operator's policy and/or network service.

Implementation Considerations 
    
   Since we are proposing LMP extensions, it is important to briefly 
   discuss their implementation.  
    
   First, we note that several different implementations of LMP itself 
   are possible, depending on the specific system architecture and the 
   design tradeoffs made in implementing it.  The LMP specification does 
   not require a specific protocol implementation, and both centralized 
   (for example, in the control plane) or distributed (for example, 
   different LMP stacks running on different line cards) are possible. 
 
Soumiya & Rabbat (Eds.)        Expires - December 2003        [Page 8] 
 
         draft-soumiya-lmp-fault-notification-ext-01         June 2003 
 
 
   In fact, a hybrid implementation, where some LMP functions are 
   distributed while others are centralized, is also possible, with it 
   being the system designer∆s decision.  In that respect, one should 
   understand the design decision∆s impact on the implementation of the 
   flooding method. 
    
   For a centralized control plane-based LMP implementation, no further 
   changes need to be made, besides the implementation of the steps 
   highlighted in section 3.  
    
   For a fully-distributed implementation of LMP, some amount of message 
   passing has to take place to communicate fault information between 
   LMP stacks.  One implementation, for example, could be to have the 
   control plane execute the steps of section 3.  An LMP stack upon 
   receiving any of the messages explained in section 4, forwards them 
   to the Fault Notification Protocol process in the control plane.  
   After the message has been processed in the control plane, and an LMP 
   message has to be generated, the message may either be generated in 
   the control plane and sent to the relevant LMP process that transmits 
   it to the correct destination, or a communication may be sent to the 
   relevant LMP process to generate and transmit the appropriate LMP 
   message. 
    
    
8. 
Security Considerations 
    
   Security requirements depend on the level of trust between nodes that 
   exchange fault notification messages.  In general, when nodes in an 
   optical network are in the same administrative domain as opposed to 
   talking to nodes in a different administrative domain, security 
   considerations may be more relaxed. 
    
   When a fault notification mechanism is implemented based on LMP, the 
   security mechanisms of LMP can be adopted.  All LMP messages should 
   be sent over an IPsec channel that has been either pre-established or 
   is set-up on an as-needed basis. 
    
   Note however that Fault Notification Protocol itself introduces no 
   new security considerations.

Conclusion 
    
   This draft describes extensions to the Link Management Protocol (LMP) 
   for use in fault notification in optical networks.  We presented the 
   motivation for this work and the working of the implementation.  We 
   also presented some descriptive scenarios on how controlled flooding 
   of fault notification operates.

 Intellectual Property Considerations 
    
   This section is taken from Section 10.4 of RFC 2026 [1]. 
    
   The IETF takes no position regarding the validity or scope of any 
   intellectual property or other rights that might be claimed to 
   pertain to the implementation or use of the technology described in 
   this document or the extent to which any license under such rights 
   might or might not be available; neither does it represent that it 
   has made any effort to identify any such rights.  Information on the 
   IETF's procedures with respect to rights in standards-track and 
   standards-related documentation can be found in BCP-11.  Copies of 
   claims of rights made available for publication and any assurances of 
   licenses to be made available, or the result of an attempt made to 
   obtain a general license or permission for the use of such 
   proprietary rights by implementors or users of this specification can 
   be obtained from the IETF Secretariat. 
    
   The IETF invites any interested party to bring to its attention any 
   copyrights, patents or patent applications, or other proprietary 
   rights, which may cover technology that may be required to practice 
   this standard.  Please address the information to the IETF Executive 
   Director.
