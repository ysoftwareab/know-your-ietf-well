  PCEP Extensions for Establishing Relationships Between Sets of LSPs
                  draft-ietf-pce-association-group-00

Abstract

   This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs in the context of a PCE.  This grouping can then be used to
   define associations between sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and
   a set of attributes (such as configuration parameters or behaviors),
   and is equally applicable to the active and passive modes of a
   stateful PCE as well as a stateless PCE.

Requirements Language

1.  Introduction

   [RFC5440] describes the Path Computation Element Protocol PCEP.  PCEP
   enables the communication between a Path Computation Client (PCC) and
   a Path Control Element (PCE), or between PCE and PCE, for the purpose
   of computation of Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) as well as
   Generalzied MPLS (GMPLS) for Traffic Engineering Label Switched Path
   (TE LSP) characteristics.

Internet-Draft            PCE association group            November 2015


   Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]  specifies a set of
   extensions to PCEP to enable stateful control of TE LSPs between and
   across PCEP sessions in compliance with [RFC4657] and focuses on a
   model where LSPs are configured on the PCC and control over them is
   delegated to the PCE.  The model of operation where LSPs are
   initiated from the PCE is described in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].

   This document introduces a generic mechanism to create a grouping of
   LSPs.  This grouping can then be used to define associations between
   sets of LSPs or between a set of LSPs and a set of attributes (such
   as configuration parameters or behaviors), and is equally applicable
   to the active and passive modes of a stateful PCE and a stateless
   PCE.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the following terms defined in [RFC5440]: PCC,
   PCE, PCEP Peer.

   The following term is defined in this document:

   Association Timeout Interval: when a PCEP session is terminated, a
   PCC waits for this time period before deleting associations created
   by the PCEP peer.

3.  Architectural Overview

3.1.  Motivation

   Stateful PCE provides the ability to update existing LSPs and to
   instantiate new ones.  To enable support for PCE-controlled make-
   before-break and for protection, there is a need to define
   associations between LSPs.  For example, the association between the
   original and the re-optimized path in the make-before break scenario,
   or between the working and protection path in end-to-end protection.
   Another use for LSP grouping is for applying a common set of
   configuration parameters or behaviors to a set of LSPs.

   For a stateless PCE, it might be useful to associate a path
   computation request to an association group, thus enabling it to
   associate a common set of configuration parameters or behaviors with
   the request.

   Rather than creating separate mechanisms for each use case, this
   draft defines a generic mechanism that can be reused as needed.

3.2.  Operation Overview

   LSPs are associated with other LSPs with which they interact by
   adding them to a common association group.  Association groups as
   defined in this document can be applied to LSPs originating at the
   same head end or different head ends.  For LSPs originating at the
   same head end, the association can be initiated by either the PCC
   (head end) or by a PCE.  Only a stateful PCE can initiate an
   association for LSPs originating at different head ends.  For both
   cases, the association is uniquely identified by the combination of
   an association identifier and the address of the node that created
   the association.

   Multiple types of groups can exist, each with their own identifiers
   space.  The definition of the different association types and their
   behaviors is outside the scope of this document.  The establishment
   and removal of the association relationship can be done on a per LSP
   basis.  An LSP may join multiple association groups, of different or
   of the same type.

   In the case of a stateless PCE, associations are created out of band,
   and PCEP peers should be aware of the association and its
   significance outside of the protocol.

   Association groups can be created by both PCC and PCE.  When a PCC's
   PCEP session with a PCE terminates unexpectedly, the PCC cleans up
   associations (as per the processing rules in this document).

4.  ASSOCIATION Object

4.1.  Object Definition

   Creation of an association group and modifications to its membership
   can be initiated by either the PCE or the PCC.  Association groups
   and their memberships are defined using the ASSOCIATION object for
   stateful PCE.

   ASSOCIATION Object-Class is to be assigned by IANA (TBD).

   ASSOCIATION Object-Type is 1 for IPv4 and its format is shown in
   Figure 1:

   Reserved: 16 bits - MUST be set to 0 and ignored upon receipt.

   Flags: 16 bits - The following flags are currently defined:

   R (Removal - 1 bit):  when set, the requesting PCE peer requires the
      removal of an LSP from the association group.

   Association type: 16 bits - the association type (for example
   protection).  The association type will be defined in separate
   documents.

   Association ID: 16 bits - the identifier of the association group.
   When combined with Type and Association Source, this value uniquely
   identifies an association group.  The value 0xffff and 0x0 are
   reserved.  The value 0xffff is used to indicate all association
   groups.

   Association Source: 4 or 16 bytes - An IPv4 or IPv6 address, which is
   associated to the node that originated the association.

   Optional TLVs: The optional TLVs follow the PCEP TLV format of
   [RFC5440].  This document defines two optional TLVs.

4.2.  Object Encoding in PCEP messages

   The ASSOCIATION Object is OPTIONAL and MAY be carried in the Path
   Computation Update (PCUpd), Path Computation Report (PCRpt) and Path
   Computation Initiate (PCinit) messages.

   When carried in PCRpt message, it is used to report the association
   group membership information pertaining to a LSP to a stateful PCE.
   It can also be used to remove an LSP from one or more association
   groups by setting the R flag to 1.  Unless, a PCE wants to delete an
   association from an LSP, it does not need to carry the ASSOCIATION
   object while updating other LSP attributes using the PCUpd message.

   The PCRpt message is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   updated as below:


   <PCRpt Message> ::= <Common Header>
                       <state-report-list>
   Where:

     <state-report-list> ::= <state-report>[<state-report-list>]

      <state-report> ::= [<SRP>]
                         <LSP>
                         [<association-list>]
                         <path>
   Where:

   <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

   When an LSP is delegated to a stateful PCE, the stateful PCE can
   initiate a new association group for this LSP, or associate it with
   one or more existing association groups.  This is done by including
   the ASSOCIATION Object in a PCUpd message or in a PCInit message.  A
   stateful PCE can also remove a delegated LSP from one or more
   association groups by setting the R flag to 1.

   The PCUpd message is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] and
   updated as below:

   <PCUpd Message> ::= <Common Header>
                       <update-request-list>
   Where:
      <update-request-list> ::= <update-request>[<update-request-list>]

      <update-request> ::= <SRP>
                           <LSP>

                           <path>

   Where:  <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

   The PCInitiate message is defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp]
   and updated as below:

   <PCInitiate Message> ::= <Common Header>
                            <PCE-initiated-lsp-list>
   Where:

      <PCE-initiated-lsp-list> ::=
      <PCE-initiated-lsp-request>[<PCE-initiated-lsp-list>]

      <PCE-initiated-lsp-request>::=
      (<PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation>|<PCE-initiated-lsp-deletion>)

      <PCE-initiated-lsp-instantiation> ::= <SRP>
                                            <LSP>
                                            <END-POINTS>
                                            <ERO>

                                            [<attribute-list>]

   Where:
   <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

   In case of passive stateful or stateless PCE, the ASSOCIATION Object
   is OPTIONAL and MAY be carried in the Path Computation Request
   (PCReq) message.

Internet-Draft            PCE association group            November 2015


   When carried in a PCReq message, the ASSOCIATION Object is used to
   associate the path computation request to an association group, the
   association might be further informed via PCRpt message in case of
   passive stateful PCE later or it might be created out of band in case
   of stateless PCE.

   The PCReq message is defined in [RFC5440] and updated in [I-D.ietf-
   pce-stateful-pce], it is further updated below for association:

                      [<LOAD-BALANCING>]

   Where:
         <association-list> ::= <ASSOCIATION> [<association-list>]

   Note that LSP object MAY be present for the passive stateful PCE.

4.3.  Processing Rules

   Both a PCC and a PCE can create one or more association groups for an
   LSP.  But a PCE peer cannot add new members for association group
   created by another peer.  If a PCE peer does not recognize the
   ASSOCIATION object, it MUST return a PCErr message with Error-Type
   "Unknown Object" as described in [RFC5440].  If a PCE peer is
   unwilling or unable to process the ASSOCIATION object, it MUST return
   a PCErr message with the Error-Type "Not supported object" and follow
   the relevant procedures described in [RFC5440].

   The association timeout interval is as a PCC-local value that can be
   operator-configured or computed by the PCC based on local policy and
   is used in the context of cleaning up associations on session
   failure.  The association timeout must be set to a value no larger

   than the state timeout interval (defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]) and larger than the delegation timeout
   interval (defined in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce].

   When a PCC's PCEP session wih the PCE terminates unexpectedly, the
   PCC MUST wait for the association timeout interval before cleaning up
   the association.  If this PCEP session can be re-established before
   the association timeout interval time expires, no action is taken to
   clean the association created by this PCE.  During the time window of
   the redelegation timeout interval and the association timeout
   interval, the PCE, after re-establishing the session, can also ask
   for redelegation following the procedure defined in
   [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]  and [I-D.ietf-pce-pce-initiated-lsp].
   When the association timeout interval timers expires, the PCC clears
   all the associations which are not delegated to any PCEs.

   Upon LSP delegation revocation, the PCC MAY clear the association
   created by the related PCE, but in order to avoid traffic loss, it
   can perform this in a make-before-break fashion, which is the same as
   what is defined in Stateful pce [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce] for
   handling LSP state cleanup.

   Error handling for situations for multiple PCE scenarios will be
   included in future versions of this draft.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The "PCEP Parameters" registry contains a subregistry "PCEP Objects".
   This document request IANA to allocate the values from this registry.

    Object-Class Value  Name                               Reference

           TBD          Association                        This document
                        Object-Type
                        1: IPv4
                        2: IPv6

   This document defines the following new PCEP TLVs:

              Value     Meaning                     Reference
               TBD      Global Association Source   This document
               TBD      Extended Association Id     This document

   This document requests IANA to create a subregistry of the "PCEP
   Parameters" for the bits carried in the Flags field of the
   ASSOCIATION object.  The subregistry is called "ASSOCIATION Flags
   Field".

   The field contains 12 bits numbered from bit 0 as the most
   significant bit.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations described in [I-D.ietf-pce-stateful-pce]
   apply to the extensions described in this document.  Additional
   considerations related to a malicious PCE are introduced, as the PCE
   may now create additional state on the PCC through the creation of
   association groups.
