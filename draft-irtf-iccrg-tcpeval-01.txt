                      Common TCP Evaluation Suite
                      draft-irtf-iccrg-tcpeval-01

Abstract

   This document presents an evaluation test suite for the initial
   assessment of proposed TCP modifications.  The goal of the test suite
   is to allow researchers to quickly and easily evaluate their proposed
   TCP extensions in simulators and testbeds using a common set of well-
   defined, standard test cases, in order to compare and contrast
   proposals against standard TCP as well as other proposed
   modifications.  This test suite is not intended to result in an
   exhaustive evaluation of a proposed TCP modification or new
   congestion control mechanism.  Instead, the focus is on quickly and
   easily generating an initial evaluation report that allows the
   networking community to understand and discuss the behavioral aspects
   of a new proposal, in order to guide further experimentation that
   will be needed to fully investigate the specific aspects of such
   proposal.

1.  Introduction

   This document describes a common test suite for the initial
   assessment of new TCP extensions or modifications.  It defines a
   small number of evaluation scenarios, including traffic and delay
   distributions, network topologies, and evaluation parameters and
   metrics.  The motivation for such an evaluation suite is to help
   researchers in evaluating their proposed modifications to TCP.  The
   evaluation suite will also enable independent duplication and
   verification of reported results by others, which is an important
   aspect of the scientific method that is not often put to use by the
   networking community.  A specific target is that the evaluations
   should be able to be completed in a reasonable amount of time by
   simulation, or with a reasonable amount of effort in a testbed.

   It is not possible to provide TCP researchers with a complete set of
   scenarios for an exhaustive evaluation of a new TCP extension;
   especially because the characteristics of a new extension will often
   require experiments with specific scenarios that highlight its
   behavior.  On the other hand, an exhaustive evaluation of a TCP

Internet-Draft         Common TCP Evaluation Suite             July 2014


   extension will need to include several standard scenarios, and it is
   the focus of the test suite described in this document to define this
   initial set of test cases.

   These scenarios generalize current characteristics of the Internet
   such as round-trip times (RTT), propagation delays, and buffer sizes.
   It is envisaged that as the Internet evolves these will need to be
   adjusted.  In particular, we expect buffer sizes will need to be
   adjusted as latency becomes increasingly important.

   The scenarios specified here are intended to be as generic as
   possible, i.e., not tied to a particular simulation or emulation
   platform.  However, when needed some details pertaining to
   implementation using a given tool are described.

   This document has evolved from a "round-table" meeting on TCP
   evaluation, held at Caltech on November 8-9, 2007, reported in
   [TESTSUITE08].  This document is the first step in constructing the
   evaluation suite; the goal is for the evaluation suite to be adapted
   in response to feedback from the networking community.  It revises
   draft-irtf-tmrg-tests-02 [I-D-TMRG-TESTS].

   The traces used and a sample implementation (including patched ns-2)
   are available from: http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/wiki/

2.  Traffic generation

   Congestion control concerns the response of flows to bandwidth
   limitations or to the presence of other flows.  Cross-traffic and
   reverse-path traffic are therefore important to the tests described
   in this suite.  Such traffic can have the desirable effect of
   reducing the occurrence of pathological conditions, such as global
   synchronization among competing flows, that might otherwise be mis-
   interpreted as normal average behaviours of those protocols
   [FLOYD03][MASCOLO06].  This traffic must be reasonably realistic for
   the tests to predict the behaviour of congestion control protocols in
   real networks, and also well-defined so that statistical noise does
   not mask important effects.

2.1.  Desirable model characteristics

   Most scenarios use traffic produced by a traffic generator, with a
   range of start times for user sessions, flow sizes, and the like,
   mimicking the traffic patterns commonly observed in the Internet.  It
   is important that the same "amount" of congestion or cross-traffic be
   used for the testing scenarios of different congestion control
   algorithms.  This is complicated by the fact that packet arrivals and



Hayes, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft         Common TCP Evaluation Suite             July 2014


   even flow arrivals are influenced by the behavior of the algorithms.
   For this reason, a pure open-loop, packet-level generation of traffic
   where generated traffic does not respond to the behaviour of other
   present flows is not suitable.  Instead, emulating application or
   user behaviours at the end points using reactive protocols such as
   TCP in a closed-loop fashion results in a closer approximation of
   cross-traffic, where user behaviours are modeled by well-defined
   parameters for source inputs (e.g., request sizes for HTTP),
   destination inputs (e.g., response size), and think times between
   pairs of source and destination inputs.  By setting appropriate
   parameters for the traffic generator, we can emulate non-greedy user-
   interactive traffic (e.g., HTTP 1.1, SMTP and remote login), greedy
   traffic (e.g., P2P and long file downloads), as well as long-lived
   but non-greedy, non-interactive flows (or thin streams).

   This approach models protocol reactions to the congestion caused by
   other flows in the common paths, although it fails to model the
   reactions of users themselves to the presence of congestion.  A model
   that includes end-users' reaction to congestion is beyond the scope
   of this draft, but we invite researchers to explore how the user
   behavior, as reflected in the flow sizes, user wait times, and number
   of connections per session, might be affected by the level of
   congestion experienced within a session [ROSSI03].

2.2.  Tmix

   There are several traffic generators available that implement a
   similar approach to that discussed above.  For now, we have chosen to
   use the Tmix [WEIGLE06] traffic generator.  Tmix is available for the
   NS2 and NS3 simulators, and can generate traffic for testbeds (for
   example GENI [GENITMIX]).

   Tmix represents each TCP connection by a connection vector (CV)
   consisting of a sequence of (request-size, response-size, think-time)
   triples, thus representing bi-directional traffic.  Connection
   vectors used for traffic generation can be obtained from Internet
   traffic traces.

2.2.1.  Base Tmix trace files for tests

   The traces currently defined for use in the test suite are based on
   campus traffic at the University of North Carolina (see [TRACES] for
   a description of construction methods and basic statistics).

   The traces have an additional "m" field added to each connection
   vector to provide each direction's maximum segment size for the
   connection.  This is used to provide the packet size distribution
   described in Section 2.4.



Hayes, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft         Common TCP Evaluation Suite             July 2014


   These traces contain a mixture of connections, from very short flows
   that do not exist for long enough to be "congestion controlled", to
   long thin streams, to bulk file transfer like connections.

   The traces are available at:
   http://trac.tools.ietf.org/group/irtf/trac/wiki/ICCRG

   Each of the nine bidirectional trace files are named with the
   following convention:

       rAsI.org

   where the I is the number of the Tmix initiator node, and A is the
   number of the tmix acceptor node, when the traffic sources are set up
   in the dumbbell configuration shown in Figure 2.

2.3.  Loads

   While the protocols being tested may differ, it is important that we
   maintain the same "load" or level of congestion for the experimental
   scenarios.  For many of the scenarios, such as the basic ones in
   Section 4, each scenario is run for a range of loads, where the load
   is varied by varying the rate of session arrivals.

2.3.1.  Varying the Tmix traffic load

   To adjust the traffic load for a given scenario, the connection start
   times for flows in a Tmix trace are scaled as follows.  Connections
   are actually started at:

       experiment_cv_start_time = scale * cv_start_time              (1)

   where cv_start_time denotes the connection vector start time in the
   Tmix traces and experiment_cv_start_time is the time the connection
   starts in the experiment.  Therefore, the smaller the scale the
   higher (in general) the traffic load.

2.3.1.1.  Notes

   Changing the connection start times also changes the way the traffic
   connections interact, potentially changing the "clumping" of traffic
   bursts.

   Very small changes in the scaling parameter can cause
   disproportionate changes in the offered load.  This is due to
   possibility of the small change causing the exclusion or inclusion of
   a CV that will transfer a very large amount of data.

Internet-Draft         Common TCP Evaluation Suite             July 2014


2.3.2.  Dealing with non-stationarity

   The Tmix traffic traces, as they are, offer a non-stationary load.
   This is exacerbated for tests that do not require use of the full
   trace files, but only a portion of them.  While removing this non-
   stationarity does also remove some of the "realism" of the traffic,
   it is necessary for the test suite to produce reliable and consistent
   results.

   A more stationary offered load is achieved by shuffling the start
   times of connection vectors in the Tmix trace file.  The trace file
   is logically partitioned into n-second bins, which are then shuffled
   using a Fisher-Yates shuffle [SHUFFLEWIKI], and the required portions
   written to shuffled trace files for the particular experiment being
   conducted.

2.3.2.1.  Bin size

   The bin size is chosen so that there is enough shuffling with respect
   to the test length.  The offered traffic per test second from the
   Tmix trace files depends on a scale factor (see Section 2.3.1), which
   is related to the capacity of the bottleneck link.  The shuffling bin
   size (in seconds) is set at:

      b = 500e6 / C                                                  (2)

   where C is the bottleneck link's capacity in bits per second, and
   500e6 is a scaling factor (in bits).

   Thus for the access link scenario described in Section 4.4.2, the bin
   size for shuffling will be 5 seconds.

2.3.2.2.  NS2 implementation specifics

   The tcl scripts for this process are distributed with the NS2 example
   test suite implementation.  Care must be taken when using this
   algorithm, so that the given random number generator and the same
   seed are employed, or else the resulting experimental traces will be
   different.

2.4.  Packet size distribution

   For flows generated by the traffic generator, 10% of them use
   536-byte packets, and 90% 1500-byte packets.  The base Tmix traces
   described in Section 2.2.1 have been processed at the _connection_
   level to have this characteristic.  As a result, _packets_ in a given
   test will be roughly, but not be exactly, in this proportion.




Hayes, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015                [Page 7]

Internet-Draft         Common TCP Evaluation Suite             July 2014


   However, the proportion of offered traffic will be consistent for
   each experiment.

2.4.1.  Potential revision

   As Tmix can now read and use a connection's Maximum Segment Size
   (MSS) from the trace file, it will be possible to produce Tmix
   connection vector trace files where the packet sizes reflect actual
   measurements.

3.  Achieving reliable results in minimum time

   This section describes the techniques used to achieve reliable
   results in the minimum test time.

3.1.  Background

   Over a long time, because the session arrival times are to a large
   extent independent of the transfer times, load could be defined as:

       A = E[f]/E[t],

   where E[f] is the mean session (flow) size in bits transferred, E[t]
   is the mean session inter-arrival time in seconds, and A is the load
   in bps.

   It is important to test congestion control protocols in "overloaded"
   conditions.  However, if A > C, where C is the capacity of the
   bottleneck link, then the system has no equilibrium.  In long-running
   experiments with A > C, the expected number of flows would keep on
   increasing with time (because as time passes, flows would tend to
   last for longer and longer, thus "piling up" with newly-arriving
   ones).  This means that, in an overload scenario, some measures will
   be very sensitive to the duration of the tests.

3.2.  Equilibrium or Steady State

   Ideally, experiments should be run until some sort of equilibrium
   results can be obtained.  Since every test algorithm can potentially
   change how long this may take, the following approach is adopted:

   1.  Traces are shuffled to remove non-stationarity (see
       Section 2.3.2.)

   2.  The experiment run time is determined from the traffic traces.
       The shuffled traces are compiled such that the estimate of
       traffic offered in the second third of the test is equal to the
       estimate of traffic offered in the final third of the test, to



Hayes, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015                [Page 8]

Internet-Draft         Common TCP Evaluation Suite             July 2014


       within a 5% tolerance.  The length of the trace files becomes the
       total experiment run time (including the warm up time).

   3.  The warmup time until measurements start, as shown in Section 4,
       is calculated as the time at which the NS2 simulation of standard
       TCP achieves "steady state".  In this case, warmup time is
       determined as the time required so the measurements have
       statistically similar first and second half results.  The metrics
       used as reference are: the bottleneck raw throughput, and the
       average bottleneck queue size.  The latter is stable when A >> C
       and A << C, but not when A ~= C.  In this case the queue is not a
       stable measure, and just the raw bottleneck throughput is used.

3.2.1.  Note on the offered load in NS2

   The offered load in an NS2 simulation using one-way TCP will be
   higher than the estimated load.  One-way TCP uses fixed TCP segment
   sizes, so all transmissions that would normally use a segment size
   less than the maximum segment size (in this case 496B or 1460B), such
   as at the end of a block of data, or for short queries or responses,
   will still be sent as a maximum segment size packet.

3.3.  Accelerated test start up time

   Tmix traffic generation does not provide an instant constant load.
   It can take quite a long time for the number of simultaneous TCP
   connections, and thus the offered load, to build up.  To accelerate
   the system start up, the system is "prefilled" to a state close to
   "steady state".  This is done by starting initial sessions over a
   shorter interval than they would normally start, and biasing the
   sessions started to longer sessions.  Details of how this is achieved
   follow.

   Connections that start before t=prefill_t in the Tmix traces, are
   selected with a bias toward longer sessions (connections which are
   estimated to continue past the long_flow_bias time (see Figure 1)).
   These selected connections are then started at an accelerated rate by
   starting them over the time interval prefill_si.

   The prefill_t (in seconds) calculation is based on the following
   heuristic:

       prefill_t = 1.5 * targetload * maxRTT                         (3)

   where maxRTT is the median maximum RTT in the particular topology,
   and targetload is given as a percentage.  This generally works quite
   well, but requires some adjustment for very high BDP scenarios.

   Experiment tables specify the prefill_t value to be used in each
   experiment.

   The long_flow_bias threshold is set at

       long_flow_bias = prefill_t / 2 .                              (4)

   These values are not optimal, but have been experimentally determined
   to give reasonable results.

   The start up time interval, prefill_si, is calculated as follows:

       prefill_si = total_pfcb / (C * TL / 100.0)                    (5)

   where total_pfcb is the total number of bits estimated to be sent by
   the prefill connections, C is the capacity of the bottleneck link,
   and TL is the target offered load as a percentage.

   This procedure has the effect of quickly bringing the system to a
   loaded state.  From this point the system runs until t = warmup (as
   calculated in Section 3.2), after which moment statistics are
   computed.

4.  Basic scenarios

   The purpose of the basic scenarios is to explore the behavior of a
   TCP modification over different link types.  These scenarios use the
   dumbbell topology described in Section 4.1.

4.1.  Basic topology

   Most tests use a simple dumbbell topology with a central link that
   connects two routers, as illustrated in Figure 2.  Each router is
   also connected to three nodes by edge links.  In order to generate a
   typical range of round trip times, edge links have different delays.
   Unless specified otherwise, such delays are as follows.  On one side,
   the one-way propagation delays are: 0ms, 12ms and 25ms; on the other:
   2ms, 37ms, and 75ms.  Traffic is uniformly shared among the nine
   source/destination pairs, giving a distribution of per-flow RTTs in
   the absence of queueing delay shown in Table 1.  These RTTs are
   computed for a dumbbell topology assuming a delay of 0ms for the
   central link.  The delay for the central link that is used in a
   specific scenario is given in the next section.

4.2.  Traffic

   In all of the basic scenarios, _all_ TCP flows use the TCP extension
   or modification under evaluation.

   In general, the 9 bidirectional Tmix sources are connected to nodes 1
   to 6 of Figure 2 to create the paths tabulated in Table 1.

   Offered loads are estimated directly from the shuffled and scaled
   Tmix traces, as described in Section 3.2.  The actual measured loads
   will depend on the TCP variant and the scenario being tested.

   Buffer sizes are based on the Bandwidth Delay Product (BDP), except
   for the Dial-up scenario where a BDP buffer does not provide enough
   buffering.

   The load generated by Tmix with the standard trace files is
   asymmetric, with a higher load offered in the right to left direction
   (refer to Figure 2) than in the left to right direction.  Loads are
   specified for the higher traffic right to left direction.  For each
   of the basic scenarios, three offered loads are tested: moderate
   (60%), high (85%), and overload (110%).  Loads are for the bottleneck
   link, which is the central link in all scenarios except the wireless
   LAN scenario.

   The 9 Tmix traces are scaled using a single scaling factor in these
   tests.  This means that the traffic offered on each of the 9 paths
   through the network is not equal, but combined at the bottleneck
   produces the specified offered load.

4.3.  Flows under test

   For these basic scenarios, there is no differentiation between
   "cross-traffic" and the "flows under test".  The aggregate traffic is
   under test, with the metrics exploring both aggregate traffic and
   distributions of flow-specific metrics.

4.4.  Scenarios

4.4.1.  Data Center

   The data center scenario models a case where bandwidth is plentiful
   and link delays are generally low.  All links have a capacity of 1
   Gbps.  Links from nodes 1, 2 and 4 have a one-way propagation delay
   of 10 us, while those from nodes 3, 5 and 6 have 100 us [ALIZADEH10],
   and the central link has 0 ms delay.  The central link has 10 ms
   buffers.

4.4.1.1.  Potential Revisions

   The rate of 1 Gbps is chosen such that NS2 simulations can run in a
   reasonable time.  Higher values will become feasible (in simulation)
   as computing power increases, however the current traces may not be
   long enough to drive simulations or test bed experiments at higher
   rates.

   The supplied Tmix traces are used here to provide a standard
   comparison across scenarios.  Data Centers, however, have very
   specialised traffic which may not be represented well in such traces.
   In the future, specialised Data Center traffic traces may be needed
   to provide a more realistic test.

4.4.2.  Access Link

   The access link scenario models an access link connecting an
   institution (e.g., a university or corporation) to an ISP.  The
   central and edge links are all 100 Mbps.  The one-way propagation
   delay of the central link is 2 ms, while the edge links have the
   delays given in Section 4.1.  Our goal in assigning delays to edge
   links is only to give a realistic distribution of round-trip times
   for traffic on the central link.  The Central link buffer size is 100
   ms, which is equivalent to the BDP (using the mean RTT).

4.4.2.1.  Potential Revisions

   As faster access links become common, the link speed for this
   scenario will need to be updated accordingly.  Also as access link
   buffer sizes shrink to less than BDP sized buffers, this should be
   updated to reflect these changes in the Internet.

4.4.3.  Trans-Oceanic Link

   The trans-oceanic scenario models a test case where mostly lower-
   delay edge links feed into a high-delay central link.  Both the
   central and all edge links are 1 Gbps.  The central link has 100 ms
   buffers, and a one-way propagation delay of 65 ms.  65 ms is chosen
   as a "typical number".  The actual delay on real links depends, of
   course, on their length.  For example, Melbourne to Los Angeles is
   about 85 ms.

4.4.4.  Geostationary Satellite

   The geostationary satellite scenario models an asymmetric test case
   with a high-bandwidth downlink and a low-bandwidth uplink
   [HENDERSON99][GURTOV04].  The scenario modeled is that of nodes
   connected to a satellite hub which has an asymmetric satellite
   connection to the master base station which is connected to the
   Internet.  The capacity of the central link is asymmetric--40 Mbps
   down, and 4 Mbps up with a one-way propagation delay of 300 ms.  Edge
   links are all bidirectional 100 Mbps links with one-way delays as
   given in Section 4.1.  The central link buffer size is 100 ms for
   downlink and 1000 ms for uplink.

   Note that congestion in this case is often on the 4 Mbps uplink (left
   to right), even though most of the traffic is in the downlink
   direction (right to left).

4.4.5.  Wireless LAN

   The wireless LAN scenario models WiFi access to a wired backbone, as
   depicted in Figure 3.

   The capacity of the central link is 100 Mbps, with a one-way delay of
   2 ms.  All links to Router 2 are wired.  Router 1 acts as a base
   station for a shared wireless IEEE 802.11g links.  Although 802.11g
   has a peak bit rate of 54 Mbps, its typical throughput rate is much
   lower, and decreases under high loads and bursty traffic.  The scales
   specified here are based on a nominal rate of 6 Mbps.

   The Node_[123] to Wireless_[123] connections are to allow the same
   RTT distribution as for the wired scenarios.  This is in addition to
   delays on the wireless link due to CSMA.  Figure 3 shows how the
   topology should look in a test bed.

                Table 6: Wireless LAN scenario parameters.

   The percentage load for this scenario is based on the sum of the
   estimate of offered load in both directions since the wireless
   bottleneck link is a shared media.  Also, due to contention for the
   bottleneck link, the accelerated start up using prefill is not used
   for this scenario.

4.4.5.1.  NS2 implementation specifics

   In NS2, this is implemented as depicted in Figure 2.  The delays
   between Node_1 and Wireless_1 are implemented as delays through the
   Logical Link layer.

   Since NS2 doesn't have a simple way of measuring transport packet
   loss on the wireless link, dropped packets are inferred based on flow
   arrivals and departures (see Figure 4).  This gives a good estimate
   of the average loss rate over a long enough period (long compared
   with the transit delay of packets), which is the case here.

4.4.5.2.  Potential revisions

   Wireless standards are continually evolving.  This scenario may need
   updating in the future to reflect these changes.

   Wireless links have many other unique properties not captured by
   delay and bitrate.  In particular, the physical layer might suffer
   from propagation effects that result in packet losses, and the MAC
   layer might add high jitter under contention or large steps in
   bandwidth due to adaptive modulation and coding.  Specifying these
   properties is beyond the scope of the current first version of this
   test suite but may make useful additions in the future.

   Latency in this scenario is very much affected by contention for the
   media.  It will be good to have end-to-end delay measurements to
   quantify this characteristic.  This could include per packet latency,
   application burst completion times, and/or application session
   completion times.

4.4.6.  Dial-up Link

   The dial-up link scenario models a network with a dial-up link of 64
   kbps and a one-way delay of 5 ms for the central link.  This could be
   thought of as modeling a scenario reported as typical in Africa, with
   many users sharing a single low-bandwidth dial-up link.  Central link
   buffer size is 1250 ms.  Edge links are 100 Mbps.

                Table 7: Dial-up link scenario parameters.

4.4.6.1.  Note on parameters

   The traffic offered by Tmix over a low bandwidth link is very bursty.
   It takes a long time to reach some sort of statistical stability.
   For event based simulators, this is not too much of a problem, as the
   number of packets transferred is not prohibitively high, however for
   test beds these times are prohibitively long.  This scenario needs
   further investigation to address such issue.

4.4.6.2.  Potential revisions

   Modems often have asymmetric up and down link rates.  Asymmetry is
   tested in the Geostationary Satellite scenario (Section 4.4.4), but
   the dial-up scenario could be modified to model this as well.

4.5.  Metrics of interest

   For each run, the following metrics will be collected for the central
   link in each direction:

   1.  the aggregate link utilization,

   2.  the average packet drop rate, and

   3.  the average queueing delay.

   These measures only provide a general overview of performance.  The
   goal of this draft is to produce a set of tests that can be "run" at
   all levels of abstraction, from Grid500's WAN, through WAN-in-Lab,
   testbeds and simulations all the way to theory.  Researchers may add
   additional measures to illustrate other performance aspects as
   required.

   Other metrics of general interest include:

   1.  end-to-end delay measurements

   2.  flow-centric:

       a. sending rate,

       b. goodput,

       c. cumulative loss and queueing delay trajectory for each flow,
       over time,

       d. the transfer time per flow versus file size

   3.  stability properties:

       a. standard deviation of the throughput and the queueing delay
       for the bottleneck link,

       b. worst case stability measures, especially proving (possibly
       theoretically) the stability of TCP.

4.6.  Potential Revisions

   As with all of the scenarios in this document, the basic scenarios
   could benefit from more measurement studies about characteristics of
   congested links in the current Internet, and about trends that could
   help predict the characteristics of congested links in the future.

   This would include more measurements on typical packet drop rates,
   and on the range of round-trip times for traffic on congested links.

5.  Latency specific experiments

5.1.  Delay/throughput tradeoff as function of queue size

   Performance in data communications is increasingly limited by
   latency.  Smaller and smarter buffers improve this measure, but often
   at the expense of TCP throughput.  The purpose of these tests is to
   investigate delay-throughput tradeoffs, _with and without the
   particular TCP extension under study_.

   Different queue management mechanisms have different delay-throughput
   tradeoffs.  It is envisaged that the tests described here would be
   extended to explore and compare the performance of different Active
   Queue Management (AQM) techniques.  However, this is an area of
   active research and beyond the scope of this test suite at this time.
   For now, it may be better to have a dedicated, separate test suite to
   look at AQM performance issues.

5.1.1.  Topology

   These tests use the topology of Section 4.1.  They are based on the
   access link scenario (see Section 4.4.2) with the 85% offered load
   used for this test.

   For each Drop-Tail scenario set, five tests are run, with buffer
   sizes of 10%, 20%, 50%, 100%, and 200% of the Bandwidth Delay Product
   (BDP) for a 100 ms base RTT flow (the average base RTT in the access
   link dumbbell scenario is 100 ms).

5.1.1.1.  Potential revisions

   Buffer sizing is still an area of research.  Results from this
   research may necessitate changes to the test suite so that it models
   these changes in the Internet.

   AQM is currently an area of active research as well.  It is envisaged
   that these tests could be extended to explore and compare the
   performance of key AQM techniques when it becomes clear what these
   will be.  For now a dedicated AQM test suite would best serve such
   research efforts.

5.1.2.  Flows under test

   Two kinds of tests should be run: one where all TCP flows use the TCP
   modification under study, and another where no TCP flows use such
   modification, as a "baseline" version.

   The level of traffic from the traffic generator is the same as that
   described in Section 4.4.2.

5.1.3.  Metrics of interest

   For each test, three figures are kept: the average throughput, the
   average packet drop rate, and the average queueing delay over the
   measurement period.

   Ideally it would be better to have more complete statistics,
   especially for queueing delay where the delay distribution can be
   important.  It would also be good for this to be illustrated with a
   delay/bandwidth graph, where the x-axis shows the average queueing
   delay, and the y-axis shows the average throughput.  For the drop-
   rate graph, the x-axis shows the average queueing delay, and the
   y-axis shows the average packet drop rate.  Each pair of graphs
   illustrates the delay/throughput/drop-rate tradeoffs with and without
   the TCP mechanism under evaluation.  For an AQM mechanism, each pair
   of graphs also illustrates how the throughput and average queue size
   vary (or don't vary) as a function of the traffic load.  Examples of
   delay/throughput tradeoffs appear in Figures 1-3 of [FLOYD01] and
   Figures 4-5 of [ANDREW08].

5.2.  Ramp up time: completion time of one flow

   These tests aim to determine how quickly existing flows make room for
   new flows.

5.2.1.  Topology and background traffic

   The ramp up time test uses the topology shown in Figure 5.  Two long-
   lived test TCP connections are used in this experiment.  Test TCP
   connection 1 is connected between T_n1 and T_n3, with data flowing
   from T_n3 to T_n1, and test TCP source 2 is connected between T_n2
   and T_n4, with data flowing from T_n4 to T_n2.  The background
   traffic topology is identical to that used in the basic scenarios
   (see Section 4 and Figure 2); i.e., background flows run between
   nodes B_n1 to B_n6.

   Experiments are conducted with capacities of 10 Mbps and 1 Gbps for
   the central link.  Edge links are 1 Gbps.

   For each capacity, three RTT scenarios should be tested, in which the
   existing and newly arriving flow have RTTs of (80,80), (120,30), and
   (30,120) respectively.  This is achieved by having a central link
   with 2 ms delay in each direction, and test link delays as shown in
   Table 8.

   The buffers in R1 and R2 are sized at BDP (80ms worth of 1500B packet
   buffering).

                For all tests: test_duration = 600 seconds.

       Table 9: Ramp-up time scenario parameters (times in seconds).

   For each RTT scenario, three tests are run with a different offset to
   the random number generator's base seed (see Table 9).

   Throughout the experiment, the offered load of the background (or
   cross) traffic is 50% of the central link capacity in the right to
   left direction.  The background traffic is generated in the same
   manner as for the basic scenarios (see Section 4) except that the bin
   size for shuffling is set to 3 s for all scenarios.

   All traffic for this scenario uses the TCP extension under test.

5.2.2.  Flows under test

   Traffic is dominated by the two long lived test flows, because we
   believe that to be the worst case, in which convergence is slowest.

   One flow starts in "equilibrium" (at least having finished normal
   slow-start).  A new flow then starts; slow-start is disabled by
   setting the initial slow-start threshold to the initial CWND.  Slow
   start is disabled because this is the worst case, and could happen if
   a loss occurred in the first RTT.

   Both of the flows use 1500-byte packets.  The test should be run both
   with Standard TCP and with the TCP extension under test for
   comparison.

5.2.2.1.  Potential Revisions

   It may also be useful to conduct the tests with slow start enabled
   too, if time permits.

5.2.3.  Metrics of interest

   The output of these experiments are the time until the (1500 * 10^n)-
   th byte of the new flow is received, for n = 1,2,... .  This measures
   how quickly the existing flow releases capacity to the new flow,
   without requiring a definition of when "fairness" has been achieved.
   By leaving the upper limit on n unspecified, the test remains
   applicable to very high-speed networks.

   A single run of this test cannot achieve statistical reliability by
   running for a long time.  Instead, an average over at least three
   runs should be taken.  Different cross traffic is generated using the
   standard Tmix trace files by changing the random number seed used to
   shuffle the traces (as listed in Table 9).

5.3.  Transients: release of bandwidth, arrival of many flows

   These tests investigate the impact of a sudden change of congestion
   level.  They differ from the "Ramp up time" test in that the
   congestion here is caused by unresponsive traffic.

   Note that this scenario has not yet been implemented in the NS2
   example test suite.

5.3.1.  Topology and background traffic

   The network is a single bottleneck link (see Figure 6), with bit rate
   100 Mbps, with a buffer of 1024 packets (i.e., 120% of the BDP at 100
   ms).  Edge links are also 100 Mbps.

   The transient traffic is generated using UDP, to avoid overlap with
   the ramp-up time scenario (see Section 5.2) and isolate the behavior
   of the flows under study.

   Three transients are tested:

   1.  step decrease from 75 Mbps to 0 Mbps,

   2.  step increase from 0 Mbps to 75 Mbps,

   3.  30 step increases of 2.5 Mbps at 1 s intervals.

   These transients occur after the flow under test has exited slow-
   start, and remain until the end of the experiment.

   There is no TCP cross traffic in this experiment.

5.3.2.  Flows under test

   There is one flow under test: a long-lived flow in the same direction
   as the transient traffic, with a 100 ms RTT.  The test should be run
   both with Standard TCP and with the TCP extension under test for
   comparison.

5.3.3.  Metrics of interest

   For the decrease in cross traffic, the metrics are

   1.  the time taken for the TCP flow under test to increase its window
       to 60%, 80% and 90% of its BDP, and

   2.  the maximum change of the window in a single RTT while the window
       is increasing to that value.

   For cases with an increase in cross traffic, the metric is the number
   of _cross traffic_ packets dropped from the start of the transient
   until 100 s after the transient.  This measures the harm caused by
   algorithms which reduce their rates too slowly on congestion.

6.  Throughput- and fairness-related experiments

6.1.  Impact on standard TCP traffic

   Many new TCP proposals achieve a gain, G, in their own throughput at
   the expense of a loss, L, in the throughput of standard TCP flows
   sharing a bottleneck, as well as by increasing the link utilization.
   In this context a "standard TCP flow" is defined as a flow using SACK
   TCP [RFC2883] but without ECN [RFC3168].

   The intention is for a "standard TCP flow" to correspond to TCP as
   commonly deployed in the Internet today (with the notable exception
   of CUBIC, which runs by default on the majority of web servers).
   This scenario quantifies this trade off.

6.1.1.  Topology and background traffic

   The basic dumbbell topology of Section 4.1 is used with the same
   capacities as for the ramp-up time tests in Section 5.2.  All traffic
   in this scenario comes from the flows under test.

     Figure 7: Dumbbell Topology for Assessing Impact on Standard TCP.

6.1.2.  Flows under test

   The scenario is performed by conducting pairs of experiments, with
   identical flow arrival times and flow sizes.  Within each experiment,
   flows are divided into two camps.  For every flow in camp A, there is
   a flow with the same size, source and destination in camp B, and vice
   versa.

   These experiments use duplicate copies of the Tmix traces used in the
   basic scenarios (see Section 4).  Two offered loads are tested: 50%
   and 100%.

   Two experiments are conducted.  A BASELINE experiment where both camp
   A and camp B use standard TCP.  In the second, called MIX, camp A
   uses standard TCP and camp B uses the new TCP extension under
   evaluation.

   The rationale for having paired camps is to remove the statistical
   uncertainty which would come from randomly choosing half of the flows
   to run each algorithm.  This way, camp A and camp B have the same
   loads.

           Table 10: Impact on Standard TCP scenario parameters.

6.1.3.  Metrics of interest

   The gain achieved by the new algorithm and loss incurred by standard
   TCP are given, respectively, by G = T(B)_Mix/T(B)_Baseline and L =
   T(A)_Mix/T(A)_Baseline where T(x) is the throughput obtained by camp
   x, measured as the amount of data acknowledged by the receivers (that
   is, "goodput").

   The loss, L, is analogous to the "bandwidth stolen from TCP" in
   [SOUZA03] and "throughput degradation" in [SHIMONISHI07].

   A plot of G vs L represents the tradeoff between efficiency and loss.

6.1.3.1.  Suggestions

   Other statistics of interest are the values of G and L for each
   quartile of file sizes.  This will reveal whether the new proposal is
   more aggressive in starting up or more reluctant to release its share
   of capacity.

   As always, testing at other loads and averaging over multiple runs is
   encouraged.

6.2.  Intra-protocol and inter-RTT fairness

   These tests aim to measure bottleneck bandwidth sharing among flows
   of the same protocol with the same RTT, which represents the flows
   going through the same routing path.  The tests also measure inter-
   RTT fairness, the bandwidth sharing among flows of the same protocol
   where routing paths have a common bottleneck segment but might have
   different overall paths with different RTTs.

6.2.1.  Topology and background traffic

   The topology, the capacity and cross traffic conditions of these
   tests are the same as in Section 5.2.  The bottleneck buffer is
   varied from 25% to 200% of the BDP for a 100 ms base RTT flow,
   increasing by factors of 2.

6.2.2.  Flows under test

   We use two flows of the same protocol variant for this experiment.
   The RTTs of the flows range from 10 ms to 160 ms (10 ms, 20 ms, 40
   ms, 80 ms, and 160 ms) such that the ratio of the minimum RTT over
   the maximum RTT is at most 1/16.

6.2.2.1.  Intra-protocol fairness

   For each run, two flows with the same RTT, taken from the range of
   RTTs above, start randomly within the first 10% of the experiment
   duration.  The order in which these flows start doesn't matter.  An
   additional test of interest, but not part of this suite, would
   involve two extreme cases - two flows with very short or long RTTs
   (e.g., a delay less than 1-2 ms representing communication happening
   in a data-center, and a delay larger than 600 ms representing
   communication over a satellite link).

6.2.2.2.  Inter-RTT fairness

   For each run, one flow with a fixed RTT of 160 ms starts first, and
   another flow with a different RTT taken from the range of RTTs above,
   joins afterward.  The starting times of both two flows are randomly
   chosen within the first 10% of the experiment as before.

6.2.3.  Metrics of interest

   The output of this experiment is the ratio of the average throughput
   values of the two flows.  The output also includes the packet drop
   rate for the congested link.

6.3.  Multiple bottlenecks

   These experiments explore the relative bandwidth for a flow that
   traverses multiple bottlenecks, with respect to that of flows that
   have the same round-trip time but each traverse only one of the
   bottleneck links.

6.3.1.  Topology and traffic

   The topology is a "parking-lot" topology with three (horizontal)
   bottleneck links and four (vertical) access links.  The bottleneck
   links have a rate of 100 Mbps, and the access links have a rate of 1
   Gbps.

   All flows have a round-trip time of 60 ms, to enable the effect of
   traversing multiple bottlenecks to be distinguished from that of
   different round trip times.

   This can be achieved in both a symmetric and asymmetric way (see
   Figure 8 and Figure 9).  It is not clear whether there are
   interesting performance differences between these two topologies, and
   if so, which is more typical of the actual Internet.

   The r4s1.org Tmix trace file is used to generate the traffic.  Each
   Tmix source offers the same load for each experiment.  Three
   experiments are conducted at 30%, 40%, and 50% offered loads per Tmix
   source.  As two sources share each of the three bottlenecks (A,B,C),
   the combined offered loads on the bottlenecks is 60%, 80%, and 100%
   respectively.

   All traffic uses the new TCP extension under test.

6.3.2.  Metrics of interest

   The output for this experiment is the ratio between the average
   throughput of the single-bottleneck flows and the throughput of the
   multiple-bottleneck flow, measured after the warmup period.  Output
   also includes the packet drop rate for the congested link.

7.  Implementations

   At the moment the only implementation effort is using the NS2
   simulator.  It is still a work in progress, but contains the base to
   most of the tests, as well as the algorithms that determined the test
   parameters.  It is being made available to the community for further
   development and verification through https://bitbucket.org/hayesd/
   tcp-evaluation-suite-public .

   At the moment there are no ongoing test bed implementations.  We
   invite the community to initiate and contribute to the development of
   these test beds.

Appendix A.  Discussions on Traffic

   While the protocols being tested may differ, it is important that we
   maintain the same "load" or level of congestion for the experimental
   scenarios.  To enable this, we use a hybrid of open-loop and close-



Hayes, et al.            Expires January 5, 2015               [Page 32]

Internet-Draft         Common TCP Evaluation Suite             July 2014


   loop approaches.  For this test suite, network traffic consists of
   sessions corresponding to individual users.  Because users are
   independent, these session arrivals are well modeled by an open-loop
   Poisson process.  A session may consist of a single greedy TCP flow,
   multiple greedy flows separated by user "think" times, a single non-
   greedy flow with embedded think times, or many non-greedy "thin
   stream" flows.  The session arrival process forms a Poisson process
   [HOHN03].  Both the think times and burst sizes have heavy-tailed
   distributions, with the exact distribution based on empirical
   studies.  The think times and burst sizes will be chosen
   independently.  This is unlikely to be the case in practice, but we
   have not been able to find any measurements of the joint
   distribution.  We invite researchers to study this joint
   distribution, and future revisions of this test suite will use such
   statistics when they are available.

   For most current traffic generators, the traffic is specified by an
   arrival rate for independent user sessions, along with specifications
   of connection sizes, number of connections per sessions, user wait
   times within sessions, and the like.  Because the session arrival
   times are specified independently of the transfer times, one way to
   specify the load would be as

     A = E[f]/E[t],

   where E[f] is the mean session size (in bits transferred), E[t] is
   the mean session inter-arrival time in seconds, and A is the load in
   bps.

   Instead, for equilibrium experiments, we measure the load as the
   "mean number of jobs in an M/G/1 queue using processor sharing,"
   where a job is a user session.  This reflects the fact that TCP aims
   at processor sharing of variable sized files.  Because processor
   sharing is a symmetric discipline [KELLY79], the mean number of flows
   is equal to that of an M/M/1 queue, namely rho/(1-rho), where
   rho=lambda S/C, and lambda is the arrival rate of jobs/flows (in
   flows per second), S is the mean job size (in bits) and C is the
   bottleneck capacity (in bits per second).  For small loads, say 10%,
   this is essentially equal to the fraction of the capacity that is
   used.  However, for overloaded systems, the fraction of the bandwidth
   used will be much less than this measure of load.

   In order to minimize the dependence of the results on the experiment
   durations, scenarios should be as stationary as possible.  To this
   end, experiments will start with rho/(1-rho) active cross-traffic
   flows, with traffic of the specified load.
