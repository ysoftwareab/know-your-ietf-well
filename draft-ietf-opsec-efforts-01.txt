Internet-Draft       Security Efforts and Documents            July 2005


1.  Introduction

   The Internet is being recognized as a critical infrastructure similar
   in nature to the power grid and a potable water supply.  Just like
   those infrastructures, means are needed to provide resiliency and
   adaptability to the Internet so that it remains consistently
   available to the public throughout the world even during times of
   duress or attack.  For this reason, many SDOs are developing
   standards with hopes of retaining an acceptable level, or even
   improving this availability, to its users.  These SDO efforts usually
   define themselves as "security" efforts.  It is the opinion of the
   authors that there are many different definitions of the term
   "security" and it may be applied in many diverse ways.  As such, we
   offer no assurance that the term is applied consistently throughout
   this document.

   Many of these SDOs have diverse charters and goals and will take
   entirely different directions in their efforts to provide standards.
   However, even with that, there will be overlaps in their produced
   works.  If there are overlaps then there is a potential for conflicts
   and confusion.  This may result in:

      Vendors of networking equipment who are unsure of which standard
      to follow.

      Purchasers of networking equipment who are unsure of which
      standard will best apply to the needs of their business or
      ogranization.

      Network Administrators and Operators unsure of which standard to
      follow to attain the best security for their network.

   For these reasons, the authors wish to encourage all SDOs who have an
   interest in producing or in consuming standards relating to good
   security practices to be consistent in their approach and their
   recommendations.  In many cases, the authors are aware that the SDOs
   are making good efforts along these lines.  However, the authors do
   not participate in all SDO efforts and cannot know everything that is
   happening.

   The OpSec Working Group met at the 61st IETF and agreed that this
   document could be a useful reference in producing the documents
   described in the Working Group Charter.  The authors have agreed to
   keep this document current and request that those who read it will
   submit corrections or comments.

   Comments on this document may be addressed to the OpSec Working Group
   or directly to the authors.

2.  Format of this Document

   The body of this document has three sections.

   The first part of the body of this document, Section 3, contains a
   listing of online glossaries relating to networking and security.  It
   is very important that the definitions of words relating to security
   and security events be consistent.  Inconsistencies between the
   useage of words on standards is unacceptable as it would prevent a
   reader of two standards to appropriately relate their
   recommendations.  The authors of this document have not reviewed the
   definitions of the words in the listed glossaries so can offer no
   assurance of their alignment.

   The second part, Section 4, contains a listing of SDOs that appear to
   be working on security standards.

   The third part, Section 5, lists the documents which have been found
   to offer good practices or recommendations for securing networks and
   networking devices.

3.  Online Security Glossaries

   This section contains references to glossaries of network and
   computer security terms

3.1  ATIS Telecom Glossary 2000

   http://www.atis.org/tg2k/

   Under an approved T1 standards project (T1A1-20), an existing 5800-
   entry, search-enabled hypertext telecommunications glossary titled
   Federal Standard 1037C, Glossary of Telecommunication Terms was
   updated and matured into this glossary, T1.523-2001, Telecom Glossary
   2000.  This updated glossary was posted on the Web as a American
   National Standard (ANS).

3.2  Critical Infrastructure Glossary of Terms and Acronyms

   http://www.ciao.gov/ciao_document_library/glossary/a.htm

   The Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office (CIAO) was created to
   coordinate the Federal Government's initiatives on critical
   infrastructure assurance.  While the glossary was not created as a
   glossary specifically for security terms, it is populated with many
   security related definitions, abbreviations, organizations, and
   concepts.

3.3  Internet Security Glossary - RFC 2828

   http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2828.txt

   Created in May 2000, the document defines itself to be, "an
   internally consistent, complementary set of abbreviations,
   definitions, explanations, and recommendations for use of terminology
   related to information system security."  The glossary makes the
   distinction of the listed definitions throughout the document as
   being:

   o  a recommended Internet definition

   o  a recommended non-Internet definition

   o  not recommended as the first choice for Internet documents but
      something that an author of an Internet document would need to
      know

   o  a definition that shouldn't be used in Internet documents

   http://www.sans.org/resources/glossary.php

   The SANS Institute (SysAdmin, Audit, Network, Security) was created
   in 1989 as, "a cooperative research and education organization."
   Updated in May 2003, SANS cites the NSA for their help in creating
   the online glossary of security terms.  The SANS Institute is also
   home to many other resources including the SANS Intrusion Detection
   FAQ and the SANS/FBI Top 20 Vulnerabilities List.

   the November 2002 SG13 meeting, a preliminary description of the
   Project was achieved and endorsed by SG13 with the goal to launch the
   Project.  It is regularly updated since then.

   The role of the NGN 2004 Project is to organize and to coordinate
   ITU-T activities on Next Generation Networks.  Its target is to
   produce a first set of Recommendations on NGN by the end of this
   study period, i.e. mid-2004.

5.26  NRIC VI Focus Groups

   http://www.nric.org/fg/index.html

   The Network Reliability and Interoperability Council (NRIC) was
   formed with the purpose to provide recommendations to the FCC and to
   the industry to assure the reliability and interoperability of
   wireless, wireline, satellite, and cable public telecommunications
   networks.  These documents provide general information and guidance
   on NRIC Focus Group 1B (Cybersecurity) Best Practices for the
   prevention of cyberattack and for restoration following a
   cyberattack.

   tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security-jc

   The purpose of the Security JC is to coordinate the technical
   activities of multiple security related TCs.  The SJC is advisory
   only, and has no deliverables.  The Security JC will promote the use
   of consistent terms, promote re-use, champion an OASIS security
   standards model, provide consistent PR, and promote mutuality,
   operational independence and ethics.

5.28  OASIS Security Services TC

   http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=security

   The Security Services TC is working to advance the Security Assertion
   Markup Language (SAML) as an OASIS standard.  SAML is an XML
   framework for exchanging authentication and authorization
   information.

5.29  OIF Implementation Agreements

   The OIF has 2 approved Implementation Agreements (IAs) relating to
   security.  They are:

   OIF-SMI-01.0 - Security Management Interfaces to Network Elements

   This Implementation Agreement lists objectives for securing OAM&P
   interfaces to a Network Element and then specifies ways of using
   security systems (e.g., IPsec or TLS) for securing these interfaces.
   It summarizes how well each of the systems, used as specified,
   satisfies the objectives.

   OIF - SEP - 01.1 - Security Extension for UNI and NNI

   This Implementation Agreement defines a common Security Extension for

5.30  TIA

   The TIA has produced the "Compendium of Emergency Communications and
   Communications Network Security-related Work Activities".  This
   document identifies standards, or other technical documents and
   ongoing Emergency/Public Safety Communications and Communications
   Network Security-related work activities within TIA and it's
   Engineering Committees.  Many P25 documents are specifically
   detailed.  This "living document" is presented for information,
   coordination and reference.

5.31  WS-I Basic Security Profile

   http://www.ws-i.org/Profiles/BasicSecurityProfile-1.0.html

   The WS-I Basic Security Profile 1.0 consists of a set of non-
   proprietary Web services specifications, along with clarifications
   and amendments to those specifications which promote
   interoperability.
