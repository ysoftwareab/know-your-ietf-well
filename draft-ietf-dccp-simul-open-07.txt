Abstract

   This document specifies an update to the Datagram Congestion Control
   Protocol (DCCP), a connection-oriented and datagram-based transport
   protocol.  The update adds support for the DCCP-Listen packet.  This
   assists DCCP applications to communicate through middleboxes (e.g. a
   DCCP server behind a firewall, or a Network Address Port Translator),
   where peering endpoints need to initiate communication in a near-
   simultaneous manner to establish necessary middlebox state.

Internet-Draft      DCCP Simultaneous-Open Technique            Jan 2009


1.  Introduction

   The Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) [RFC4340] is both
   datagram-based and connection-oriented.  According to RFC 4340, DCCP
   servers establish connections by passively listening for incoming
   connection requests that are actively transmitted by DCCP clients.
   These asymmetric roles can cause problems when the server is 'inside'
   a middlebox, such as a Network Address and Port Translator (NAPT)
   that only allows connection requests to be initiated from inside
   (e.g. due to port overloading) [ID-BEHAVE-DCCP].  Host-based and
   network firewalls can also implement policies that lead to similar
   problems.  This behaviour is currently the default for many
   firewalls.

   UDP can support middlebox traversal using various techniques
   [RFC4787] that leverage the connectionless nature of UDP and are
   therefore not suitable for DCCP.  TCP supports middlebox traversal
   through the use of its simultaneous open procedure [RFC5382].  The
   concepts of the TCP solution are applicable to DCCP, but DCCP can not
   simply reuse the same methods (see [Appendix A]).

   After discussing the problem space for DCCP, this document specifies
   an update to the DCCP state machine to offer native support to allow
   a DCCP client to establish a connection to a DCCP server that is
   inside one or more middleboxes.  This reduces dependence on external
   aids such as data relay servers [ID-BEHAVE-TURN] by explicitly
   supporting a widely used principle known as 'hole punching'.

   The method requires only a minor change to the standard DCCP
   operational procedure.  The use of a dedicated DCCP packet type ties
   usage to a specific condition, ensuring the method is inter-operable
   with hosts that do not implement this update, or choose to disable it
   (see Section 4).

1.1.  Scope of this Document

   This method is useful in scenarios when a DCCP server is located
   inside a middlebox.  It is relevant to both client/server and peer-
   to-peer applications, such as VoIP, file sharing, or online gaming
   and assists connections that utilise prior out-of-band signaling
   (e.g. via a well-known rendezvous server ([RFC3261], [H.323])) to
   notify both endpoints of the connection parameters ([RFC3235],
   [NAT-APP]).

1.2.  DCCP NAT Traversal

   The behavioural requirements for NAT devices supporting DCCP are
   described in [ID-BEHAVE-DCCP].  A "traditional NAT" [RFC3022], that

Internet-Draft      DCCP Simultaneous-Open Technique            Jan 2009


   directly maps an IP address to a different IP address does not
   require the simultaneous open method described in this document.

   The method is required when the DCCP server is positioned behind one
   or more NAPT devices in the path (hierarchies of nested NAPT devices
   are possible).  This document refers to DCCP hosts located inside one
   or more NAPT devices as having "private" addresses, and to DCCP hosts
   located in the global address realm as having "public" addresses.

   DCCP NAT traversal is considered for the following scenarios:

   1.  Private client connects to public server.

   2.  Public client connects to private server.

   3.  Private client connects to private server.

   A defining characteristic of traditional NAT devices [RFC3022] is
   that private hosts can connect to external hosts, but not vice versa.
   Hence the case (1) is possible using the protocol defined in
   [RFC4340].  A pre-configured, static NAT address map would allow
   outside hosts to connections in cases (2) and (3).

   A DCCP implementation conforming to [RFC4340] and a NAT device
   conforming to [ID-BEHAVE-DCCP] would require a DCCP relay server to
   perform NAT traversal for cases (2) and (3).

   This document describes a method to support cases (2) and (3) without
   the aid of a DCCP relay server.  This method updates RFC 4340 and
   requires the DCCP server to discover the IP address and the DCCP port
   that correspond to the DCCP client.  Such signalling may be performed
   out-of-band (e.g. using SDP [RFC4566]).

1.3.  Structure of this Document

   For background information on existing NAT traversal techniques,
   please consult Appendix A.

   The normative specification of the update is presented in Section 2.
   An informative discussion of underlying design decisions then
   follows, in Section 3.  Security considerations are provided in
   Section 4 and IANA considerations in the concluding Section 5.

2.  Procedure for Near-Simultaneous Open

   This section is normative and specifies the simultaneous-open
   technique for DCCP.  It updates the connection-establishment
   procedures of [RFC4340].

2.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The document uses the terms and definitions provided in [RFC4340].
   Familiarity with this specification is assumed.  In particular, the
   following convention from ([RFC4340], 3.2) is used:

      "Each DCCP connection runs between two hosts, which we often name
      DCCP A and DCCP B. Each connection is actively initiated by one of
      the hosts, which we call the client; the other, initially passive
      host is called the server."

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2.  Protocol Method

   The term "session" is used as defined in ([RFC2663], 2.3): DCCP
   sessions are uniquely identified by the tuple of <source IP-address,
   source port, target IP-address, target port>.

   DCCP, in addition, introduces service codes, which can be used to
   identify different services available via the same port [ID-DCCP-SC].

2.2.1.  DCCP-Listen Packet Format

   This document adds a new DCCP packet type, DCCP-Listen, whose format
   is shown below.

   o  The Source Port is the port on which the DCCP server is listening
      for a connection from the IP address that appears as the
      destination IP address in the packet.

   o  The Destination Port is the port selected by a DCCP client to
      identify a connection by the DCCP client.  In this technique, this
      value must be communicated out-of-band to the server.

   o  The value of X MUST be set to 1.  A DCCP-Listen packet is sent
      before a connection is established, therefore there is no way to
      negotiate use of short sequence numbers ([RFC4340], 5.1).

   o  The sequence number of a DCCP-Listen packet is not related to the
      DCCP sequence number for normal DCCP messages Section 3.  Thus,
      for DCCP-Listen packets:

      *  A DCCP server should set the high and low bits of the Sequence
         Number field to 0.

      *  A DCCP client MUST ignore the value of the Sequence Number
         field.

      *  Middleboxes MUST NOT interpret sequence numbers on DCCP-Listen
         packets.

   o  The Service Code field contains the service code value for which
      the server is listening for a connection ([RFC4340], 8.1.2,
      [ID-DCCP-SC]).  This value MUST correspond to a service code that
      the server is actually offering for a connection identified by the
      same source IP address and the same Source Port as that of the
      DCCP-Listen packet.  Since the server may use multiple service
      codes, the specific value of the Service Code field needs to be

      communicated out-of-band, from client to server, prior to sending
      the DCCP-Listen packet, e.g. described using the Session
      Description Protocol, SDP [RFC4566].

   o  At the time of writing, there are no known uses of header options
      ([RFC4340] , sec. 5.8) with a DCCP-Listen packet.  Clients MUST
      ignore all options in received DCCP-Listen packets.  Therefore,
      feature values can not be negotiated using a DCCP-Listen packet.

   o  At the time of writing, there are no known uses of payload data
      with a DCCP-Listen packet.  Since DCCP-Listen packets are issued
      before an actual connection is established, endpoints MUST ignore
      any payload data encountered in DCCP-Listen packets.

   o  The following protocol fields are required to have specific
      values:

      *  Data Offset MUST have a value of five or more (i.e. at least 20
         bytes).

      *  CCVal MUST be zero (a connection has not been established).

      *  CsCov MUST be zero (use of the CsCov feature can not be
         negotiated).

      *  Type has the value 10, assigned by IANA to denote a DCCP-Listen
         packet.

      *  X MUST be 1 (the Generic header must be used).

   The remaining fields, including the "Res" and "Reserved" fields are
   specified by [RFC4340] and its successors.  The interpretation of
   these fields is not modified by this document.

2.2.2.  Protocol Method for DCCP Server Endpoints

   This document updates section 8.1 of [RFC4340] for the case of a
   fully specified DCCP server endpoint.  The update modifies the way
   the server performs a passive-open.

   Prior to connection setup, it is common for a DCCP server endpoint to
   not be fully specified: before the connection is established, a
   server usually specifies only the destination port, and service code.
   (Sometimes the destination address is also specified.)  This leaves
   the source address and source port unspecified.  The endpoint only
   becomes fully specified after performing the handshake for an
   incoming connection.  For such cases, this document does not update
   [RFC4340], i.e. the server adheres to the existing state transitions
   in the left half of Figure 2 (CLOSED => LISTEN => RESPOND).

   A fully specified DCCP server endpoint permits exactly one client,
   identified by source IP-address:port, destination IP-address:port,
   plus a single service code, to set up the connection.  Such a server
   SHOULD perform the actions and state transitions shown in the right
   half of Figure 2 in section 8.4, and specified below.

   * Note: A server that responds to a DCCP-Request in the INVITED state,
   transitions to the LISTEN' state and then immediately transitions
   to the RESPOND state. This does not require reception of an
   additional DCCP-Request packet.


        Figure 2: Updated state transition diagram for DCCP-Listen

   This diagram introduces two additional DCCP server states in addition
   to those listed in section 4.3 of [RFC4340]:

   o  INVITED The INVITED state is associated with a specific DCCP
      connection and represents a fully-specified server socket in the
      listening state that is generating DCCP-Listen packets towards the
      client.

   o  LISTEN' The LISTEN' state is associated with a specific DCCP
      connection and represents a fully-specified server socket in the
      passive listening state that will not generate further DCCP-Listen
      packets towards the client.

   A fully specified server endpoint performs a passive-open from the
   CLOSED state by inviting the remote client to connect.  This is
   performed by sending a single DCCP-Listen packet to the specified
   remote IP-address:port, using the format specified in Section 2.2.1.
   The figure below provides pseudocode describing the packet processing
   in the INVITED state.  This processing step follows Step 2 in section
   8,5 of [RFC4340]).

Internet-Draft      DCCP Simultaneous-Open Technique            Jan 2009


   The INVITED state is, like LISTEN, a passive state, characterised by
   waiting in the absence of an established connection.  If the server
   endpoint in the INVITED state receives a DCCP-Request that matches
   the set of bound ports and addresses, it transitions to the LISTEN'
   state and then immediately transitions to the RESPOND state, where
   further processing resumes as specified in [RFC4340].

   The server SHOULD repeat sending a DCCP-Listen packet while in the
   INVITED state, at a 200 millisecond interval with up to at most 2
   repetitions (Section 3 discusses this choice of time interval).  If
   the server is still in the INVITED state after a further period of
   200ms following transmission of the third DCCP-Listen packet, it
   SHOULD progress to the LISTEN' state.

   Fully specified server endpoints SHOULD treat ICMP error messages
   received in response to a DCCP-Listen packet as "soft errors" that do
   not cause a state transition.  Reception of an ICMP error message as
   a result of sending a DCCP-Listen packet does not necessarily
   indicate a failure of the following connection request, and therefore
   should not result in a server state change.  This reaction to soft
   errors exploits the valuable feature of the Internet that for many
   network failures, the network can be dynamically reconstructed
   without any disruption of the endpoints.

   Server endpoints SHOULD ignore any incoming DCCP-Listen packets.  A
   DCCP server in the LISTEN, INVITED, or LISTEN' states MAY generate a
   DCCP-Reset packet (Code 7, "Connection Refused") in response to a
   received DCCP-Listen packet.  This DCCP-Reset packet is an indication
   that two servers are simultaneously awaiting connections on the same
   port.

   Further details on the design rationale are discussed in Section 3.

   The figure below provides pseudocode describing the packet processing
   in the INVITED state.  This processing step follows Step 2 in section
   8.5 of RFC 4340 [RFC4340]

2.2.3.  Protocol Method for DCCP Client Endpoints

   This document updates section 8.1.1 of [RFC4340], by adding the
   following rule for the reception of DCCP-Listen packets by clients:

   A client in any state MUST silently discard any received DCCP-Listen
   packet, unless it implements the optional procedure defined in the
   following section.

2.2.3.1.  Optional generation of Triggered Requests

   This section describes an optional optimisation at the client that
   can avoid clients having to wait for a timeout following a dropped
   DCCP-Request.  The operation requires clients to respond to reception
   of DCCP-Listen packets when received in the REQUEST state.  DCCP-
   Listen packets MUST be silently discarded in all other states.

   A client implementing this optmisation MAY immediately perform a
   retransmission of a DCCP-Request following the reception of the first
   DCCP-Listen packet.  The retransmission is performed in the same
   manner as a timeout in the REQUEST state [RFC4340].  A triggered
   retransmission SHOULD result in the client increasing the
   exponential-backoff timer interval.

   Note that a path delay greater than 200ms will result in multiple
   DCCP-Listen packets arriving at the client before a DCCP-Response is
   received.  Clients MUST therefore perform only one such
   retransmission for each DCCP connection.  This requires maintaining
   local state (e.g. one flag per connection)

   Implementors and users of this optional method need to be aware that
   host timing or path reordering can result in a server receiving two
   DCCP-Requests (i.e., the server sending one unnecessary packet).
   This would, in turn, trigger a client to send a second corresponding
   DCCP-Response (also unnecessary).  These additional packets are not
   expected to modify or delay the DCCP open procedure [RFC4340].

   Section 2.3.2 provides examples of the use of triggered
   retransmission.

2.2.4.  Processing by Routers and Middleboxes

   DCCP-Listen packets do not require special treatment and should thus
   be forwarded end-to-end across Internet paths, by routers and
   middleboxes alike.

   Middleboxes may utilise the connection information (address, port,
   service code) to establish local forwarding state.  The DCCP-Listen
   packet carries the necessary information to uniquely identify a DCCP
   session in combination with the source and destination addresses
   (found in the enclosing IP-header), including the DCCP service code
   value [ID-DCCP-SC].  The processing of the DCCP-Listen packet by NAT
   devices is specified in [ID-BEHAVE-DCCP].

2.3.  Examples of Use

   In the examples below, DCCP A is the client and DCCP B is the server.
   A middlebox device (NAT/Firewall), NA is placed before DCCP A, and
   another middlebox, NB, is placed before DCCP B. Both NA and NB use a
   policy that permits DCCP packets to traverse the device for outgoing
   links, but only permit incoming DCCP packets when a previous packet
   has been sent out for the same connection.

   In the figure below, DCCP A and DCCP B decide to communicate using an
   out-of-band mechanism (in this case labelled SDP), whereupon the
   client and server are started.  DCCP B actively indicates its
   listening state by sending a DCCP-Listen message.  This fulfils the
   requirement of punching a hole in NB (also creating the binding to
   the external address and port).  This message is dropped by NA since
   no hole exists there yet.  DCCP A initiates a connection by entering
   the REQUEST state and sending a DCCP-Request.  (It is assumed that if
   NA were a NAT device, then this would also result in a binding that
   maps the pinhole to the external address and port.)  The DCCP-Request
   is received by DCCP B, via the binding at NB.  DCCP B transmits the
   DCCP-Response and connects through the bindings now in place at NA
   and NB.

   considers the case when the server does not receive a DCCP-Request
   within the first 600 ms (often the request would be received within
   this interval).

   The repetition of DCCP-Listen packets may be implemented using a
   timer.  The timer is restarted with an interval of 200ms when sending
   each DCCP-Listen packet.  It is cancelled when the server leaves the
   INVITED state.  If the timer expires after the first and second
   transmission, it triggers a transmission of another DCCP-Listen
   Packet.  If it expires after sending the third DCCP-Listen packet,
   the server leaves the INVITED state, to enter the LISTEN' state
   (where it passively waits for a DCCP-Request).

2.3.2.  Optional Triggered Retransmission of DCCP-Request

   The following figure illustrates a triggered retransmission.  In this
   figure, the first DCCP-Listen is assumed to be lost in the network
   (e.g. does not open a pin-hole at NB).  A later DCCP-Request is also
   not received (perhaps as a side-effect of the first loss).  After
   200ms, the DCCP-Listen packet is retransmitted and correctly
   received.  This triggers the retransmission of the DCCP-Request,
   which, when received, results in a corresponding DCCP-Response.

   The figure below illustrates the sequence of packets exchanged when a
   DCCP-Listen and DCCP-Request are processed out of order.  Reception
   of the DCCP-Listen packet by the client triggers retransmission of
   the DCCP-Request.  The server responds to the first DCCP-Request, and
   enters the RESPOND state.  The server subsequently responds to the
   second DCCP-Request with another DCCP-Response, which is ignored by
   the client (already in the PARTOPEN state).

2.4.  Backwards Compatibility with RFC 4340

   No changes are required if a DCCP client conforming to this document
   communicates with a DCCP server conforming to [RFC4340].

   If a client implements only [RFC4340], an incoming DCCP-Listen packet
   would be ignored due to step 1 in [RFC4340], 8.1, which at the same
   time also conforms to the behaviour specified by this document.

   This document further does not modify communication for any DCCP
   server that implements a passive-open without fully binding the
   addresses, ports and service codes to be used.  The authors therefore
   do not expect practical deployment problems with existing conformant
   DCCP implementations.

3.  Discussion of Design Decisions

   This is an informative section that reviews the rationale for the
   design of this method.

3.1.  Rationale for a New Packet Type

   The DCCP-Listen packet specified in Section 2.2.1 has the same format
   as the DCCP-Request packet ([RFC4340], 5.1), the only difference is
   in the value of the Type field.  The usage, however, differs.  The
   DCCP-Listen packet serves as an advisory message, not as part of the
   actual connection setup: sequence numbers have no meaning, and no
   payload can be communicated.

   A DCCP-Request packet could in theory also have been used for the
   same purpose.  The following arguments were against this:

   The first problem was that of semantic overloading: the DCCP-Request
   defined in [RFC4340] serves a well-defined purpose, being the initial
   packet of the 3-way handshake.  Additional use in the manner of a
   DCCP-Listen packet would have required DCCP processors to have had
   two different processing paths: one where a DCCP-Request was
   interpreted as part of the initial handshake, and another where the
   same packet was interpreted as an indicator message.  This would
   complicate packet processing in hosts and in particular stateful
   middleboxes (which may have restricted computational resources).

   The second problem is that a client receiving a DCCP-Request from a
   server could generate a DCCP-Reset packet if it had not yet entered
   the REQUEST state (step 7 in [RFC4340], 8.5).  The method specified
   in this document lets client endpoints ignore DCCP-Listen packets.
   Adding a similar rule for the DCCP-Request packet would have been
   cumbersome: clients would not have been able to distinguish between a
   Request meant to be an indicator message and a genuinely erratic
   connection initiation.

   The third problem is similar, and refers to a client receiving the
   indication after having itself sent a (connection-initiation) DCCP-
   Request.  Step 7 in section 8.5 of [RFC4340] requires the client to
   reply to an "indicator message" Request from the server with a DCCP-
   Sync.  Since sequence numbers are ignored for this type of message,
   additional and complex processing would become necessary: either to
   ask the client not to respond to a DCCP-Request when the request is
   of type "indicator message"; or ask middleboxes and servers to ignore
   Sync packets generated in response to "indicator message" DCCP-
   Requests.  Furthermore, since no initial sequence numbers have been
   negotiated at this stage, sending a DCCP-SyncAck would not be
   meaningful.



Fairhurst                 Expires Aug 13, 2009                 [Page 17]

Internet-Draft      DCCP Simultaneous-Open Technique            Jan 2009


   The use of a separate packet type therefore allows simpler and
   clearer processing.

3.1.1.  Use of sequence numbers

   Although the DCCP-Listen sequence number fields are ignored, they
   have been retained in the DCCP-Listen packet header to reuse the
   generic header format from section 5.1 of [RFC4340].

   DCCP assigns a random initial value to the sequence number when a
   DCCP connection is established [RFC4340].  However, a sender is
   required to set this value to zero for a DCCP-Listen packet.  Both
   clients and middleboxes are also required to ignore this value.

   The rationale for ignoring the sequence number fields of DCCP-Listen
   packets is that at the time the DCCP-Listen is exchanged, the
   endpoints have not yet entered connection setup: the DCCP-Listen
   packet is sent while the server is still in the passive-open
   (INVITED) state, i.e. it has not yet allocated state, other than
   binding to the client's IP-address:port and service code.

3.2.  Generation of Listen Packets

   Since DCCP-Listen packets solve a particular problem with NAT and/or
   firewall traversal, the generation of DCCP-Listen packets on passive
   sockets is tied to a condition (binding to an a priori known remote
   address and service code) to ensure this does not interfere with the
   general case of "normal" DCCP connections (where client addresses are
   generally not known in advance).

   In the TCP world, the analogue is a transition from LISTEN to
   SYN_SENT by virtue of sending data: "A fully specified passive call
   can be made active by the subsequent execution of a SEND" ([RFC0793],
   3.8).  Unlike TCP, this update does not perform a role-change from
   passive to active.  Like TCP, DCCP-Listen packets are only sent by a
   DCCP-server when the endpoint is fully specified (Section 2.2).

3.3.  Repetition of DCCP-Listen Packets

   Repetition is a necessary requirement, to increase robustness and the
   chance of successful connection establishment when a DCCP-Listen
   packet is lost due to congestion, link loss, or some other reason.

   The decision to recommend a maximum number of 3 timeouts (2 repeated
   copies of the original DCCP-Listen packet) results from the following
   considerations: The repeated copies need to be spaced sufficiently
   far apart in time to avoid suffering from correlated loss.  The
   interval of 200 ms was chosen to accommodate a wide range of wireless

Internet-Draft      DCCP Simultaneous-Open Technique            Jan 2009


   and wired network paths.

   Another constraint is given by the retransmission interval for the
   DCCP-Request ([RFC4340], 8.1.1).  To establish state, intermediate
   systems need to receive a (retransmitted) DCCP-Listen packet before
   the DCCP-Request times out (1 second).  With three timeouts, each
   spaced 200 milliseconds apart, the overall time is still below one
   second.  On the other hand, the sum of 600 milliseconds is
   sufficiently large to provide for longer one-way delays, such as e.g.
   found on some wireless links.

   The rationale behind transitioning to the LISTEN' state after two
   repetitions is that other problems, independent of establishing
   middlebox state, may occur (such as delay or loss of the initial

4.  Security Considerations

   The method specified in this document generates a DCCP-Listen packet
   addressed to a specific DCCP client.  This exposes the state of a
   DCCP server that is in a passive listening state (i.e. waiting to
   accept a connection from a known client).

   The exposed information is not encrypted and therefore could be seen
   on the network path to the DCCP client.  An attacker on this return
   path could observe a DCCP-Listen packet and then exploit this by
   spoofing a packet (e.g.  DCCP-Request, DCCP-Reset) with the IP
   addresses, DCCP ports, and service code that correspond to the values
   to be used for the connection.  As in other on-path attacks, this
   could be used to inject data into a connection or to deny a
   connection request.  A similar on-path attack is also possible for
   any DCCP connection, once the session is initiated by the client
   ([RFC4340], Section 18).

   The DCCP-Listen packet is only sent in response to explicit prior
   out-of-band signaling from a DCCP client to the DCCP server (e.g.
   SDP [RFC4566]) information communicated via the Session Initiation
   Protocol [RFC3261]), and will normally directly precede a DCCP-
   Request sent by the client (which carries the same information).

   This update does not significantly increase the complexity or
   vulnerability of a DCCP implementation that conforms to [RFC4340].  A
   DCCP server SHOULD therefore by default permit generation of DCCP-
   Listen packets.  A server that wishes to prevent disclosing this
   information MAY refrain from generating DCCP-Listen packets, without
   impacting subsequent DCCP state transitions, but possibly inhibiting
   middlebox traversal.

5.  IANA Considerations

   The IANA should register a new Packet Type, "DCCP-Listen", in the
   IANA DCCP Packet Types Registry.  The decimal value 10 has been
   assigned to this types.  This registry entry must reference this
   document.

Appendix A.  Discussion of Existing NAT Traversal Techniques

   This appendix provides a brief review of existing techniques to
   establish connectivity across NAT devices, with the aim of providing
   background information.  This first considers TCP NAT traversal based
   on simultaneous-open, and then discuss a second technique based on
   role reversal.  Further information can be found in [GTF04] and
   [GF05].

   A central idea shared by these techniques is to make peer-to-peer
   sessions look like "outbound" sessions on each NAT device.  Often a
   rendezvous server, located in the public address realm, is used to
   enable clients to discover their NAT topology and the addresses of
   peers.

   The term 'hole punching' was coined in [FSK05] and refers to creating
   soft state in a traditional NAT device, by initiating an outbound
   connection.  A well-behaved NAT can subsequently exploit this to
   allow a reverse connection back to the host in the private address
   realm.

   UDP and TCP hole punching use nearly the same technique [RFC4787].
   The adaptation of the basic UDP hole punching principle to TCP NAT
   traversal [RFC5382] was introduced in section 4 of [FSK05] and relies
   on the simultaneous-open feature of TCP [RFC0793].  A further
   difference between UDP and TCP lies in the way the clients perform
   connectivity checks, after obtaining suitable address pairs for
   connection establishment.  Whereas in UDP a single socket is
   sufficient, TCP clients require several sockets for the same address
   and port tuple:

   o  a passive socket to listen for connectivity tests from peers and

   o  multiple active connections from the same address to test
      reachability of other peers.

   The SYN sent out by client A to its peer B creates soft state in A's
   NAT.  At the same time, B tries to connect to A:

   o  if the SYN from B has left B's NAT before the arrival of A's SYN,
      both endpoints perform simultaneous-open (4-way handshake of SYN/
      SYNACK);

   o  otherwise A's SYN may not enter B's NAT, which leads to B
      performing a normal open (SYN_SENT => ESTABLISHED) and A
      performing a simultaneous-open (SYN_SENT => SYN_RCVD =>
      ESTABLISHED).

Internet-Draft      DCCP Simultaneous-Open Technique            Jan 2009


   In the latter case, it is necessary that the NAT does not interfere
   with a RST segment (REQ-4 in [RFC5382]).  The simultaneous-open
   solution is convenient due to its simplicity, and is thus a preferred
   mode of operation in the TCP extension for ICE ([ID-MMUSIC-ICE], sec.
   2).

A.1.  NAT traversal Based on a Simultaneous-Request

   Among the various TCP NAT traversal approaches, the one using a TCP
   simultaneous-open suggests itself as a candidate for DCCP due to its
   simplicity [GF05], [NAT-APP].

   A characteristic of TCP simultaneous-open is that this erases the
   clear distinction between client and server: both sides enter through
   active (SYN_SENT) as well as passive (SYN_RCVD) states.  This
   characteristic conflicts with the DCCP design decision to provide a
   clear separation between client and server functions ([RFC4340],
   4.6).

   In DCCP several mechanisms implicitly rely on clearly-defined client/
   server roles:

   o  Feature Negotiation: with few exceptions, almost all of DCCP's
      negotiable features use the "server-priority" reconciliation rule
      ([RFC4340], 6.3.1), whereby a peer exchanges its preference lists
      of feature values, and the server decides the outcome.

   o  Closing States: only a server may generate DCCP-CloseReq packets
      (asking the peer to hold timewait state), while a client is only
      permitted to send DCCP-Close or DCCP-Reset packets to terminate a
      connection ([RFC4340], 8.3).

   o  Service Codes [ID-DCCP-SC]: a server may be associated with
      multiple service codes, while a client must be associated with
      exactly one ([RFC4340], 8.1.2).

   o  Init Cookies: may only be used by a server and on DCCP-Response
      packets ([RFC4340], 8.1.4).

   The latter two points are not obstacles per se, but would have
   hindered the transition from a passive to an active socket.  In DCCP,
   a DCCP-Request is only generated by a client.  The assumption that
   "all DCCP hosts may be clients", was dismissed, since it would
   require undersirable changes to the state machine and would limit
   application programming.  As a consequence, the retro-fitting a TCP-
   style simultaneous-open into DCCP to allow simultaneous exchange of
   DCCP-Connect packets was not recommended.

Internet-Draft      DCCP Simultaneous-Open Technique            Jan 2009


A.2.  Role Reversal

   Another simple TCP NAT traversal scheme uses role traversal ([Epp05]
   and [GTF04]), where a peer first opens an active connection for the
   single purpose of punching a hole in the firewall; and then reverts
   to a listening socket, accepting connections arriving via the new
   path.

   This solution would have had several disadvantages if used with DCCP.
   First, a DCCP server would be required to change its role to
   temporarily become a 'client'.  This would have required modification
   to the state machine, in particular the treatment of service codes
   and perhaps Init Cookies.  Further, the method must follow feature
   negotiation, since an endpoint's choice of initial options can rely
   on its role (i.e. if an endpoint knows it is the server, it can make
   a priori assumptions about the preference lists of features it is
   negotiating with the client, thereby enforcing a particular policy).
   Finally, the server would have needed additional processing to ensure
   that the connection arriving at the listening socket matches the
   previously opened active connection.

   This approach was therefore not recommend for DCCP.
