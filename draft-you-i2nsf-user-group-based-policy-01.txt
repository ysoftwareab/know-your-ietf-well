1.  Introduction

   In traditional networks, network access is typically controlled
   through a combination of mechanisms such as maintaining separate
   static VLAN/IP subnet assignments per organization, applying Access
   Control Lists (ACLs) on VLANs and/or IP subnets, leveraging Network
   Access Control (NAC).  Common side effects are:

      o Network administrators typically assume that users access the
      network from their own static location--from their assigned
      switch, VLAN, IP subnet, etc.



You, et al.            Expires September 10, 2016               [Page 2]

Internet-Draft           User-group based Policy              March 2016


      o MAC or IP address of the users' device is often used as a proxy
      for the user's identity.  As such, filtering (e.g., via ACLs) of
      the user is usually based on IP or MAC addresses.

      o Authentication of the user by the network, if it exists at all,
      typically takes place only at the access switch in conjunction
      with an AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting) server.
      Different authentication mechanisms could be used - from machine-
      based certificates to username/password challenges, to just
      "authenticating" on MAC addresses, etc.

      o Network security functions such as firewalls often act only on
      IP addresses and ports - not on the user's identity.

   These are all symptoms of a system not using actual user
   identification information, but rather, one or more attributes that
   attempt to represent a user identity.

   Traditional network access control mechanisms
   [I-D.ietf-i2nsf-problem-and-use-cases] do not work well in newer
   network paradigms.

      o First, both clients and servers can move and change their IP
      addresses on a regular basis.  For example, Wi-Fi and VPN clients,
      as well as back-end Virtual Machine (VM)-based servers, can move;
      their IP addresses could change as a result.  This means relying
      on well-known network fields (e.g., the 5-tuple) is increasingly
      inadequate to ensure consistent security policy enforcement.

      o Secondly, with more people working from non-traditional office
      setups like "working from home", there is now a need to be able to
      apply different security policies to the same set of users under
      different circumstances.  Network access needs to be granted based
      on such criteria as users' location, time-of-day, type of network
      device used (e.g., corporate issued device versus personal
      device), device's security posture, etc.  This means the network
      needs to recognize the users' identity and their current context,
      and map the users to their correct access entitlement to the
      network.

      o Moreover, implementation of coherent security policy across
      several network and network security devices is almost impossible.
      NSFs in operation could be sourced from different vendors, or
      could be different hardware models/software versions by the same
      vendor.  As a result, the capabilities as well as APIs of the NSFs
      may not be the same throughout the environment.  Finally, few
      enterprises, if any, have a complete view of all the application
      flows.  It is not uncommon for administrators to update a policy

      on a firewall, only to later find out that related ACLs, firewall
      policies, and other related mechanisms were not updated.

   Today, addressing the above issues takes considerable time and
   effort.  Most network administrators have to manually plan and
   implement necessary changes as little automation, if any, exists
   across diverse sets of network security platforms.  In line with the
   I2NSF effort to standardize APIs so as to facilitate automation, this
   draft defines User-group Aware Policy Control (UAPC), which
   facilitates consistent enforcement of policies based on user-group
   identity, and discusses how it operates in the I2NSF Service Layer
   [I-D.merged-i2nsf-framework].

      User: An individual or a group of individuals that act as a single
      entity.

      User-group: A group of users that share one or more
      characteristics and/or behaviors in common, which allows each user
      in the user-group to be assigned the same access control
      permissions.  For example, sales employees are treated with
      equivalent service policy rules when accessing the network.

      Profile: A set of capabilities, in terms of functions and
      behaviors, for a given entity or set of entities.

      Role: A role defines a set of responsibilities of an object that
      it is attached to.  This enables the functions and behavior of a
      complex object to be abstracted into just those that are required
      by a client in a particular context.

      User-group Identifier (User-group ID): An identifier that
      represents the collective identity of a group of users, and is
      determined by a set of one or more matching criteria (e.g., roles,
      4-, 5-, and 6-tuples, VLAN ID, etc.) that disambiguates this user-
      group entity from other entities.

3.  Use Cases for User-group Aware Policy Control

   With the increased popularity of enterprise wireless networks and
   remote access technologies such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN),
   enterprise networks have become borderless, and employees' locations
   can be anywhere.  Enabling large-scale employee mobility across many
   access locations improves enterprise production efficiency but also
   introduces challenges related to enterprise network management and
   security.  The IP address of the user can change frequently when the
   user is in motion.  Consequently, IP address-based policies (such as
   forwarding, routing, QoS and security policies) may not be flexible
   enough to accommodate users in motion.

   The User-group Aware Policy Control (UAPC) approach is intended to
   facilitate the consistent enforcement of policies.  As shown in
   Figure 1, a multi-technology network (e.g., Wi-Fi, 3G/LTE, ADSL and
   fiber infrastructures) can connect different types of terminal
   devices (e.g., Smartphone, tablet, and laptop) which should be able
   to access networks in a secure manner.  Security policies should be
   consistently enforced based on their user-group identities,
   regardless of whether these terminal devices connect to a wired or a
   wireless infrastructure.

4.  User-group Aware Policy Control

4.1.  Overview

   The UAPC framework is as follows enables users to be authenticated
   and classified into different user-groups at the network ingress by
   the Security Controller; this may require obtaining information from
   the Policy Server and an AAA server.  The user-group is an identifier
   that represents the collective identity of a group of users, and is
   determined by a set of pre-defined policy criteria (e.g., source IP
   address, geo-location data, time of day, or device certificate).
   Users may be moved to different user-groups if their composite
   security context and/or environment change.

   The Security Controller, if necessary, pushes the required user-group
   policies to all Network Security Functions (NSFs) that need them.
   The policies are expressed as user-group (not IP or MAC address) IDs
   so as to decouple the user identity from the network addresses of the
   user's device.

Internet-Draft           User-group based Policy              March 2016


   (Note that User-group IDs may be implemented in at least two ways:
   (1) the ingress switch inserts the user-group ID into the packets,
   and downstream NSFs match and act on the user-group ID, or (2) the
   Security Controller updates each NSF with the mapping between the
   user-group IDs and the packet tuples; NSFs map incoming packets to
   their rightful user-group IDs, and act on the user-group IDs.  These
   and other implementation methodologies are out of scope of this
   document.)

   The security policy provisioning information can be derived from the
   user's profile and credentials, as well as the group to which the
   user belongs; such information can also be derived from the outcomes
   of the dynamic security service parameter negotiation that could
   possibly take place between the user and the service provider or the
   network administrator (e.g., parameters like whether the user is
   entitled to access the enterprise network while in motion or not, the
   lease time associated to an IP address, whether the user can access
   the Internet or not, and whether traffic needs to be encrypted or
   not).  This information is transferred to the Network Security
   Functions (NSF) from the controller.  Once an incoming packet matches
   a certain user group on the NSF, the corresponding security policy
   will be enforced on that packet.

4.2.  Functional Entities

   The UAPC framework consists of four main components: (1) Policy
   Server, (2) Authentication Server, (3) Security Controller, (4)
   Network Security Functions:

   o Policy Server

   The Policy Server houses two policy databases: (1) the user-group
   criteria, which assigns users to their user-group, and (2) the rule
   base of what each user group has access to.

      - Contains (G)UI and/or APIs to enable policies to be created,
      modified, and deleted using command line, graphical tools, and/or
      programming logic

      - Contains logic to create, read, update, and delete policies and
      policy components, and apply policies to user-groups from one or
      more policy repositories

      - Contains logic to detect conflicts between policies

      - Contains logic to resolve conflicts between policies

Internet-Draft           User-group based Policy              March 2016


      - Contains logic to broker and/or federate policies between
      domains

   The above subjects are beyond the scope of this document.

   o AAA Server

   The AAA Server authenticates users, and then performs associated
   authorization and accounting functions.  The AAA server classifies
   users into different user-groups at the network ingress.  AAA server
   implementation details are out of scope for this document.

   o Security Controller

   The Security Controller coordinates various network security-related
   tasks on a set of NSFs under its administration.  In general, there
   may be multiple security domains, where each domain has its own
   security controller.  The detailed architecture is beyond the scope
   of this document.

      - Authenticates the user at the ingress using an authentication
      service.  While the authentication functionality is an integral
      part of the framework, the topics of defining and managing
      authentication rules are out of scope of this document.

      - Asks policy server for decisions to security-related requests;
      takes these decisions and invokes the set of NSFs that are
      required to implement security for that particular packet.  The
      security controller may cache policies.

      - May perform additional actions as specified by the metadata
      associated with a policy rule (e.g., the "function(s)" to be
      executed after the actions in a policy rule are executed)

      - Has an authoritative database of NSFs under its administration

      - Determines on which NSFs a given policy needs to be enforced

      - Presents a set of NBIs for applications, orchestration engines,
      etc.

      - Interfaces with NSFs via (to-be-developed) I2NSF Capability
      Layer APIs.

   o Network Security Functions

      - Packet classification: Depending on the implementation model,
      the NSF may match on User-group IDs in the packets; or it may

      match on common packet header fields such as the 5-tuple, and map
      the n-tuple to the appropriate User-group ID supplied out-of-band
      by the Security Controller.

      - Policy enforcement: Enforce the corresponding policy (or set of
      policies) if the packet matches a specified User-group ID or set
      of User-group IDs

      - Presents I2NSF Capability Layer APIs

4.3.  User Group

   The user-group is an identifier that represents the collective
   identity of a group of users, whose definition is controlled by one
   or more policy rules (e.g., source IP, geo-location, time of day, and
   device certificate).

   A given user is authenticated, and classified at the network ingress,
   and assigned to a user-group.  (The term "user" refers to any user of
   the network.  As such, servers, terminals and other devices are also
   classified and assigned to their respective user-groups.)  A user's
   group membership may change as aspects of the user change.  For
   example, if the user-group membership is determined solely by the
   source IP address, then a given user's user-group ID will change when
   the user moves to a new IP address that falls outside of the range of
   addresses of the previous user-group.

   Table 1 shows an example of how user-group definitions may be
   constructed.  User-groups may share several common criteria.  That
   is, user-group criteria are not mutually exclusive.  For example, the
   policy criteria of user-groups R&D Regular and R&D-BYOD may share the
   same set of users that belong to the R&D organization, and differ
   only in the type of client (firm-issued clients versus users'
   personal clients); likewise, the same user may be assigned to
   different user-groups depending on the time of day or the type of day
   (e.g., weekdays versus weekends); and so on.

4.4.  Inter-group Policy Enforcement

   Within the UAPC framework, inter-group policy enforcement requires
   two key components: (1) user-group-to-user-group access policies, and
   (2) sets of NSFs that are managed by sets of policies.

   First, the framework calls for an authoritative rule-base that lists
   all the destination user-groups to which all the source user-groups
   are entitled to access.  The rule-base, hosted on the Policy Server,
   enables administrators to construct authorized inter-group access
   relationships.  The simple example in Table 2 shows a policy matrix
   in which the row represents source user-groups and the column
   represents destination ones.  The inter-group rule-base is similar to
   firewall rule-bases, which are mostly made up of 5-tuples.  (Firewall
   rule-bases could and do include criteria other than the standard
   5-tuple.  Also, the user-group rule-base could consist of other
   criteria.  Actual implementation details are out of scope of this
   document.)

   The responsibility of implementing and managing the inter-group
   policies falls to the Security Controller.  The controller first
   needs to determine, (or is told) the specific NSFs on which a given
   policy is to be implemented.  The controller then communicates with
   each NSF via the I2NSF APIs to execute the required tasks.

   Inter-user-group rules are configurable.  Figure 2 illustrates how
   various user-groups and their entitlements may be structured.  The
   example shows a "north-south" model that shows how users may access
   internal network resources.  Similar models can be developed for
   "east-west" intra-data center traffic flows.

4.5.  UAPC Implementation

   The security policies are instantiated and maintained by the policy
   server.  The associated computation logic (to instantiate such
   policies) may be dynamically fed with instructions coming from the
   application.  The policy decisions could also be from the outcomes of
   dynamic security service parameter negotiations that typically take
   place at the management plane between the user and the service
   provider [RFC7297].

   The NSFs receive group-based policy provisioning information from the
   security controller.  The security policies will be enforced so that
   participating NSFs can process traffic accordingly.  There are five
   steps for implementing the UAPC framework, which are shown in
   Figure 3.

Internet-Draft           User-group based Policy              March 2016


      1.  User-group identification policies and inter-user-group access
      polices on the Policy Server are managed by authorized user(s)
      and/or team(s).

      2.  The user-group-based policies are implemented on the NSFs
      under the Security Controller's management.

      3.  When a given user first comes logs onto the network, the user
      is authenticated at the ingress switch.

      4.  If the authentication is successful, the user is placed in a
      user-group, as determined by the Policy Server.  If the
      authentication is not successful, then the user is not assigned a
      user-group, which means that the user has no access permissions
      for the network.

      5.  The user's subsequent traffic is allowed or permitted based on
      the user-group ID by the NSFs per the inter-user-group access
      policies.  (It is beyond the scope of this document as to how
      user-group IDs may be delivered to non-ingress NSFs.  See
      Section 4.1 for a brief overview of possible implementation
      methods.)

5.  Requirements for I2NSF

   Key aspects of the UAPC framework fall within the Service Layer of
   the I2NSF charter.  If the community adopts the approach as one
   possible framework for the Service Layer, the I2NSF Service Layer
   MUST support at least the following northbound APIs (NBIs):

      o The user-group classification policy database on the Policy
      Server

      o The inter-user-group access policy rule-base on the Policy
      Server

      o The inventory of NSFs under management by the Security
      Controller

      o The list of NSFs on which a given inter-user-group policy is to
      be implemented by the Security Controller.

   The framework also assumes that the I2NSF Capability Layer APIs will
   be there for the NSFs.
