           Gap Analysis on Network Virtualization Activities
          draft-bernardos-nfvrg-gaps-network-virtualization-01

Abstract

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) are changing the way the telecommunications sector will deploy,
   extend and operate their networks.  These new technologies aim at
   reducing the overall costs by outsourcing communication services from
   specific hardware in the operators' core to server farms scattered in
   datacenters (i.e. compute and storage virtualization).  In addition,
   the connecting networks are fundamentally affected in they way they
   route, process and control traffic(i.e. network virtualization).

   Virtualization is becoming a trend which is being adopted in many
   scenarios for different purposes.  This document overviews existing
   efforts around virtualization at the IETF/IRTF, focusing on those
   related to NFV and SDN.  These efforts are mapped to the most
   relevant architectures being defined outside IETF, namely at the ETSI
   NFV ISG, the ETSI MEC ISG and the ONF.

   The main goal of this document is to serve as a survey of the
   different efforts that have been taken and are currently taking place
   at IETF and IRTF in regards to network virtualization, putting them
   into context considering efforts by other SDOs, and identifying
   current gaps that can be tackled at IETF or researched at the IRTF.

1.  Introduction

   The telecommunications sector is experiencing a major revolution that
   will shape the way networks and services are designed and deployed
   for the next decade.  We are witnessing an explosion in the number of
   applications and services demanded by users, which are now really
   capable of accessing them on the move.  In order to cope with such a
   demand, some network operators are now following a cloud computing
   paradigm, enabling the reduction of the overall costs by outsourcing
   communication services from specific hardware in the operator's core
   to server farms scattered in datacenters.  These services have
   different characteristics if compared with conventional IT services
   that have to be taken into account in this cloudification process.
   Also the transport network is affected in that it is evolving to a
   more sophisticated form of IP architecture with trends like
   separation of control and data plane traffic, and more fine-grained
   forwarding of packets (beyond looking at the destination IP address)
   in the network to fulfill new business and service goals.

   Virtualization of functions also provides operators with tools to
   deploy new services much faster, as compared to the traditional use
   of monolithic and tightly integrated dedicated machinery.  As a
   natural next step, mobile network operators need to re-think how to
   evolve their existing network infrastructures and how to deploy new
   ones to address the challenges posed by the increasing customers'
   demands, as well as by the huge competition among operators.  All
   these changes are triggering the need for a modification in the way
   operators and infrastructure providers operate their networks, as
   they need to significantly reduce the costs incurred in deploying a
   new service and operating it.  Some of the mechanisms that are being
   considered and already adopted by operators include: sharing of
   network infrastructure to reduce costs, virtualization of core
   servers running in data centers as a way of supporting their load-
   aware elastic dimensioning, and dynamic energy policies to reduce the

   monthly electricity bill.  However, this has proved to be tough to
   put in practice, and not enough.  Indeed, it is not easy to deploy
   new mechanisms in a running operational network due to the high
   dependency on proprietary (and sometime obscure) protocols and
   interfaces, which are complex to manage and often require configuring
   multiple devices in a decentralized way.

   Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking
   (SDN) are changing the way the telecommunications sector will deploy,
   extend and operate their networks.  This document provides a survey
   of the different efforts that have taken and are currently taking
   place at IETF and IRTF in regards of network virtualization, looking
   at how they relate to the ETSI NFV ISG, ETSI MEC ISG and ONF
   architectural frameworks.  Based on this analysis, we also go a step
   farther, identifying which are the potential work areas where IETF/
   IRTF can work on to complement the complex network virtualization map
   of technologies being standardized today.

2.  Terminology

   The following terms used in this document are defined by the ETSI NVF
   ISG, and the ONF and the IETF:

      NFV Infrastructure (NFVI): totality of all hardware and software
      components which build up the environment in which VNFs are
      deployed

      NFV Management and Orchestration (NFV-MANO): functions
      collectively provided by NFVO, VNFM, and VIM.

      NFV Orchestrator (NFVO): functional block that manages the Network
      Service (NS) lifecycle and coordinates the management of NS
      lifecycle, VNF lifecycle (supported by the VNFM) and NFVI
      resources (supported by the VIM) to ensure an optimized allocation
      of the necessary resources and connectivity.

      OpenFlow protocol (OFP).

      Service Function Chain (SFC): for a given service, the abstracted
      view of the required service functions and the order in which they
      are to be applied.  This is somehow equivalent to the Network
      Function Forwarding Graph (NF-FG) at ETSI.

      Service Function Path (SFP): the selection of specific service
      function instances on specific network nodes to form a service
      graph through which an SFC is instantiated.

      virtual EPC (vEPC).

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization         July 2015


      Virtualized Infrastructure Manager (VIM): functional block that is
      responsible for controlling and managing the NFVI compute, storage
      and network resources, usually within one operator's
      Infrastructure Domain.

      Virtualized Network Function (VNF): implementation of a Network
      Function that can be deployed on a Network Function Virtualisation
      Infrastructure (NFVI).

      Virtualized Network Function Manager (VNFM): functional block that
      is responsible for the lifecycle management of VNF.

3.  Background

3.1.  Network Function Virtualization

   The ETSI ISG NFV is a working group which, since 2012, aims to evolve
   quasi-standard IT virtualization technology to consolidate many
   network equipment types into industry standard high volume servers,
   switches, and storage.  It enables implementing network functions in
   software that can run on a range of industry standard server hardware
   and can be moved to, or loaded in, various locations in the network
   as required, without the need to install new equipment.  To date,
   ETSI NFV is by far the most accepted NFV reference framework and
   architectural footprint.  The ETSI NFV framework architecture
   framework is composed of three domains (Figure 1):

   o  Virtualized Network Function, running over the NFVI.

   o  NFV Infrastructure (NFVI), including the diversity of physical
      resources and how these can be virtualized.  NFVI supports the
      execution of the VNFs.

   o  NFV Management and Orchestration, which covers the orchestration
      and life-cycle management of physical and/or software resources
      that support the infrastructure virtualization, and the life-cycle
      management of VNFs.  NFV Management and Orchestration focuses on
      all virtualization specific management tasks necessary in the NFV
      framework.

   The NFV architectural framework identifies functional blocks and the
   main reference points between such blocks.  Some of these are already
   present in current deployments, whilst others might be necessary
   additions in order to support the virtualization process and
   consequent operation.  The functional blocks are (Figure 2):

   o  Virtualized Network Function (VNF).

   o  Element Management (EM).

   o  NFV Infrastructure, including: Hardware and virtualized resources,

3.2.  Software Defined Networking

   The Software Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm pushes the
   intelligence currently residing in the network elements to a central
   controller implementing the network functionality through software.
   In contrast to traditional approaches, in which the network's control
   plane is distributed throughout all network devices, with SDN the
   control plane is logically centralized.  In this way, the deployment
   of new characteristics in the network no longer requires of complex
   and costly changes in equipment or firmware updates, but only a
   change in the software running in the controller.  The main advantage

   of this approach is the flexibility it provides operators with to
   manage their network, i.e., an operator can easily change its
   policies on how traffic is distributed throughout the network.

   The most visible of the SDN protocol stacks is the OpenFlow protocol
   (OFP), which is maintained and extended by the Open Network
   Foundation (ONF).  Originally this protocol was developed
   specifically for IEEE 802.1 switches conforming to the ONF OpenFlow
   Switch specification.  As the benefits of the SDN paradigm have
   reached a wider audience, its application has been extended to more
   complex scenarios such as Wireless and Mobile networks.  Within this
   area of work, the ONF is actively developing new OFP extensions
   addressing three key scenarios: (i) Wireless backhaul, (ii) Cellular
   Evolved Packet Core (EPC), and (iii) Unified access and management
   across enterprise wireless and fixed networks.

                 Figure 3: High level SDN ONF architecture

   Figure 3 shows the blocks and the functional interfaces of the ONF
   architecture, which comprises three planes: Data, Controller, and
   Application.  The Data plane comprehends several Network Entities
   (NE), which expose their capabilities toward the Controller plane via
   a Southbound API.  The Controller plane includes several cooperating
   modules devoted to the creation and maintenance of an abstracted



Bernardos, et al.        Expires January 7, 2016                [Page 9]

   resource model of the underneath network.  Such model is exposed to
   the applications via a Northbound API where the Application plane
   comprises several applications/services, each of which has exclusive
   control of a set of exposed resources.

   The Management plane spans its functionality across all planes
   performing the initial configuration of the network elements in the
   Data plane, the assignment of the SDN controller and the resources
   under its responsibility.  In the Controller plane, the Management
   needs to configure the policies defining the scope of the control
   given to the SDN applications, to monitor the performance of the
   system, and to configure the parameters required by the SDN
   controller modules.  In the Application plane, Management configures
   the parameters of the applications and the service level agreements.
   In addition to the these interactions, the Management plane exposes
   several functions to network operators which can easily and quickly
   configure and tune the network at each layer.

3.3.  Mobile Edge Computing

   Mobile Edge Computing capabilities deployed in the edge of the mobile
   network can facilitate the efficient and dynamic provision of
   services to mobile users.  The ETSI ISG MEC working group, operative
   from end of 2014, intends to specify an open environment for
   integrating MEC capabilities with service providers networks,
   including also applications from 3rd parties.  These computing
   capabilities will make available IT infrastructure for the deployment
   of functions in mobile access networks.  It can be seen then as a
   complement to both NFV and SDN.

4.  Network Virtualization at IETF/IRTF

4.1.  SFC WG

   Current network services deployed by operators often involve the
   composition of several individual functions (such as packet
   filtering, deep packet inspection, load balancing).  These services
   are typically implemented by the ordered combination of a number of
   service functions that are deployed at different points within a
   network, not necessary on the direct data path.  This requires
   traffic to be steered through the required service functions,
   wherever they are deployed.

   For a given service, the abstracted view of the required service
   functions and the order in which they are to be applied is called a
   Service Function Chain (SFC), which is called Network Function
   Forwarding Graph (NF-FG) in ETSI.  An SFC is instantiated through
   selection of specific service function instances on specific network



Bernardos, et al.        Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 10]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization         July 2015


   nodes to form a service graph: this is called a Service Function Path
   (SFP).  The service functions may be applied at any layer within the
   network protocol stack (network layer, transport layer, application
   layer, etc.).

   The SFC working group is working on an architecture for service
   function chaining that includes the necessary protocols or protocol
   extensions to convey the Service Function Chain and Service Function
   Path information to nodes that are involved in the implementation of
   service functions and Service Function Chains, as well as mechanisms
   for steering traffic through service functions.

   In terms of actual work items, the SFC WG is chartered to deliver:
   (i) a problem statement document [RFC7498], (ii) an architecture
   document [I-D.ietf-sfc-architecture], (iii) a service-level data
   plane encapsulation format (the encapsulation should indicate the
   sequence of service functions that make up the Service Function
   Chain, specify the Service Function Path, and communicate context
   information between nodes that implement service functions and
   Service Function Chains), and (iv) a document describing requirements
   for conveying information between control or management elements and
   SFC implementation points.

   Potential gap: as stated in the SFC charter, any work on the
   management and configuration of SFC components related to the support
   of Service Function Chaining will not be done yet, until better
   understood and scoped.  This part is of special interest for
   operators and would be required in order to actually put SFC
   mechanisms into operation.

   Potential gap: redundancy and reliability mechanisms are currently
   not dealt with by any WG in the IETF.  While this has been the main
   goal of the VNFpool BoF efforts, it still remains un-addressed.

4.2.  NVO3 WG

   The Network Virtualization Overlays (NVO3) WG is developing protocols
   that enable network virtualization overlays within large Data Center
   (DC) environments.  Specifically NVO3 assumes an underlying physical
   Layer 3 (IP) fabric on which multiple tenant networks are virtualized
   on top (i.e. overlays).  With overlays, data traffic between tenants
   is tunneled across the underlying DC's IP network.  The use of
   tunnels provides a number of benefits by decoupling the network as
   viewed by tenants from the underlying physical network across which
   they communicate [I-D.ietf-nvo3-arch].

   Potential gap: It would be worthwhile to see if some of the specific
   approaches developed in this WG (e.g. overlays, traffic isolation, VM



Bernardos, et al.        Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 11]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization         July 2015


   migration) can be applied outside the DC, and specifically if they
   can be applicable to mobile network virtualization (NFV).  These
   approaches would be most relevant to the ETSI Network Function
   Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), and the Virtualized
   Infrastructure Manager part of the MANO.

4.3.  DMM WG

   The Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) WG is looking at solutions
   for IP networks that enable traffic between mobile and correspondent
   nodes taking an optimal route, preventing some of the issues caused
   by the use of centralized mobility solutions, which anchor all the
   traffic at a given node (or a very limited set of nodes).  The DMM WG
   is considering the latest developments in mobile networking research
   and operational practices (i.e., flattening network architectures,
   the impact of virtualization, new deployment needs as wireless access
   technologies evolve in the coming years) and aims at describing how
   distributed mobility management addresses the new needs in this area
   better than previously standardized solutions.

   Although network virtualization is not the main area of the DMM work,
   the impact of SDN and NFV mechanisms is clear on the work that is
   currently being done in the WG.  One example is architecture defined
   for the virtual Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) in
   [I-D.matsushima-stateless-uplane-vepc].  Here, the authors describe a
   particular realization of the vEPC concept, which is designed to
   support NFV.  In the defined architecture, the user plane of EPC is
   decoupled from the control-plane and uses routing information to
   forward packets of mobile nodes.  This proposal does not modify the
   signaling of the EPC control plane, although the EPC control plane
   runs on an hypervisor.

   Potential gap: in a vEPC/DMM context, how to run the EPC control
   plane on NFV.

   The DMM WG is also looking at ways to supporting the separation of
   the Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the
   actual Data-Plane [I-D.ietf-dmm-fpc-cpdp].  The protocol semantics
   being defined abstract from the actual details for the configuration
   of Data-Plane nodes and apply between a Client function, which is
   used by an application of the mobility Control-Plane, and an Agent
   function, which is associated with the configuration of Data-Plane
   nodes according to the policies issued by the mobility Control-Plane.

   Potential gap: the actual mappings between these generic protocol
   semantics and the configuration commands required on the data plane
   network elements are not in the scope of this document, and are




Bernardos, et al.        Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization         July 2015


   therefore a potential gap that will need to be addressed (e.g., for
   OpenFlow switches).

4.4.  I2RS WG

   The Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) WG is developing a high-
   level architecture that describes the basic building-blocks to access
   the routing system through a set of protocol-based control or
   management interfaces.  This architecture, as described in
   [I-D.ietf-i2rs-architecture], comprises an I2RS Agent as a unified
   interface that is accessed by I2RS clients using the I2RS protocol.
   The client is controlled by one or more network applications and
   accesses one or more agents, as shown in the following figure:

                Figure 5: Architecture of a routing element

   The I2RS architecture proposes to use model-driven APIs.  Services
   can correspond to different data-models and agents can indicate which
   model they support.

   Potential gap: network virtualization is not the main aim of the I2RS
   WG.  However, they provide an infrastructure that can be part of an
   SDN deployment.

4.5.  BESS WG

   BGP is already used as a protocol for provisioning and operating
   Layer-3 (routed) Virtual Private Networks (L3VPNs).  The BGP Enabled
   Services (BESS) working group is responsible for defining,
   specifying, and extending network services based on BGP.  In
   particular, the working group will work on the following services:

   o  BGP-enabled VPN solutions for use in the data center networking.
      This work includes consideration of VPN scaling issues and
      mechanisms applicable to such environments.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization         July 2015


   o  Extensions to BGP-enabled VPN solutions for the construction of
      virtual topologies in support of services such as Service Function
      Chaining.

   Potential gap: The most relevant activity in BESS that would be
   worthwhile to investigate for relevance to mobile network
   virtualization (NFV) is the extensions to BGP-enabled VPN solutions
   to support of Service Function Chaining
   [I-D.rfernando-bess-service-chaining].

4.6.  VNFpool BoF

   The VNFPOOL BoF is working on the way to group Virtual Network
   Function (VNF) into pools to improve resilience, provide better
   scale-out and scale-in characteristics, implement stateful failover
   among VNF members of a pool, etc.  Additionally, they propose to
   create VNF sets from VNF pools.  For this, the BoF proposes to study
   signaling (both between members of a pool and across pools), state
   sharing mechanisms between members of a VNFPOOL, the exchange of
   reliability information between VNF sets, their users and the
   underlying network, and the reliability and security of the control
   plane needed to transport the exchanged information.

   The VNFPOOL BoF started work on the charter, use case study, and
   requirements and initial architecture.  The use cases include Content
   Deliver Networks (CDNs), the LTE mobile core network and reliable
   server pooling.  Currently, there is no activity on the mailing list
   setup for this activity.

   Potential gap: VNFPOOL tries to introduce and manage resilience in
   virtualized networking environments and therefore addresses a
   desirable feature for any software defined network.  VNFPOOL has also
   been integrated into the NFV architecture
   [I-D.bernini-nfvrg-vnf-orchestration].

4.7.  TEAS WG

   Transport network infrastructure provides end-to-end connectivity for
   networked applications and services.  Network virtualization
   facilitates effective sharing (or 'slicing') of physical
   infrastructure by representing resources and topologies via
   abstractions, even in a multi-administration, multi-vendor, multi-
   technology environment.  In this way, it becomes possible to operate,
   control and manage multiple physical networks elements as single
   virtualized network.  The users of such virtualized network can
   control the allocated resources in an optimal and flexible way,
   better adapting to the specific circumstances of higher layer
   applications.

Internet-Draft     Gap Analysis Network Virtualization         July 2015


   Abstraction and Control of Transport Networks (ACTN) intends to
   define methods and capabilities for the deployment and operation of
   transport network resources [I-D.ceccarelli-teas-actn-framework].
   This activity is currently being carried out within the Traffic
   Engineering Architecture and Signaling (TEAS) WG.

   Several use cases are being proposed for both fixed and mobile
   scenarios [I-D.leeking-teas-actn-problem-statement].

   Potential gap: Several use cases in ACTN are relevant to mobile
   network virtualization (NFV).  Control of multi-tenant mobile
   backhaul transport networks, mobile virtual network operation, etc,
   can be influenced by the location of the network functions.  A
   control architecture allowing for inter-operation of NFV and
   transport network (e.g., for combined optimization) is one relevant
   area for research.

4.8.  NFV RG

   The NFVRG focuses on research problems associated with virtualization
   of fixed and mobile network infrastructures, new network
   architectures based on virtualized network functions, virtualization
   of the home and enterprise network environments, co-existence with
   non-virtualized infrastructure and services, and application to
   growing areas of concern such as Internet of Things (IoT) and next
   generation content distribution.  Another goal of the NFVRG is to
   bring a research community together that can jointly address such
   problems, concentrating on problems that relate not just to
   networking but also to computing and storage constraints in such
   environments.

   Since the NFVRG is a research group, it has a wide scope.  In order
   to keep the focus, the group has identified some near term work
   items: (i) Policy based Resource Management, (ii) Analytics for
   Visibility and Orchestration, (iii) Virtual Network Function (VNF)
   Performance Modelling to facilitate transition to NFV and (iv)
   Security and Service Verification.

4.9.  SDN RG

   The SDNRG provides the grounds for an open-minded investigation of
   Software Defined Networking.  They aim at identifying approaches that
   can be defined and used in the near term as well as the research
   challenges in the field.  As such, they SDNRG will not define
   standards, but provide inputs to standards defining and standards
   producing organizations.





Bernardos, et al.        Expires January 7, 2016               [Page 16]

   It is working on classifying SDN models, including definitions and
   taxonomies.  It is also studying complexity, scalability and
   applicability of the SDN model.  Additionally, the SDNRG is working
   on network description languages (and associated tools), abstractions
   and interfaces.  They also investigate the verification of correct
   operation of network or node function.

   The SDNRG has produced a reference layer model RFC7426 [RFC7426],
   which structures SDNs in planes and layers which are glued together
   by different abstraction layers.  This architecture differentiates
   between the control and the management planes and provides for
   differentiated southbound interfaces (SBIs).

5.  Summary of Gaps

   Potential Gap-1: as stated in the SFC charter, any work on the
   management and configuration of SFC components related to the support
   of Service Function Chaining will not be done yet, until better
   understood and scoped.  This part is of special interest for
   operators and would be required in order to actually put SFC
   mechanisms into operation.

   Potential Gap-2: redundancy and reliability mechanisms are currently
   not dealt with by SFC or any other WG in the IETF.  While this has
   been the main goal of the VNFpool BoF efforts, it still remains un-
   addressed.

   Potential Gap-3: it would be worthwhile to see if some of the
   specific approaches developed in the NVO3 WG (e.g. overlays, traffic
   isolation, VM migration) can be applied outside the DC, and
   specifically if they can be applicable to mobile network
   virtualization (NFV).  These approaches would be most relevant to the
   ETSI Network Function Virtualization Infrastructure (NFVI), and the
   Virtualized Infrastructure Manager part of the MANO.

   Potential Gap-4: the most relevant activity in BESS that would be
   worthwhile to investigate for relevance to mobile network
   virtualization (NFV) is the extensions to BGP-enabled VPN solutions
   to support of Service Function Chaining.

   Potential Gap-5: in a vEPC/DMM context, how to run the EPC control
   plane on NFV.

   Potential Gap-6: in DMM, on the work item addressing the separation
   of the Control-Plane for mobility- and session management from the
   actual Data-Plane, the actual mappings between these generic protocol
   semantics and the configuration commands required on the data plane

   network elements (e.g., OpenFlow switches) are not currently in the
   scope of the DMM WG.

   Potential Gap-7: network virtualization is not the main aim of the
   I2RS WG.  However, they provide an infrastructure that can be part of
   an SDN deployment.

   Potential Gap-8: the most relevant activity in BESS that would be
   worthwhile to investigate for relevance to mobile network
   virtualization (NFV) is the extensions to BGP-enabled VPN solutions
   to support of Service Function Chaining.

   Potential Gap-9: VNFPOOL tries to introduce and manage resilience in
   virtualized networking environments and therefore addresses a
   desirable feature for any software defined network.  VNFPOOL has also
   been integrated into the NFV architecture
   [I-D.bernini-nfvrg-vnf-orchestration].

   Potential Gap-10: several use cases in ACTN are relevant to mobile
   network virtualization (NFV).  Control of multi-tenant mobile
   backhaul transport networks, mobile virtual network operation, etc,
   can be influenced by the location of the network functions.  A
   control architecture allowing for inter-operation of NFV and
   transport network (e.g., for combined optimization) is one relevant
   area for research.
