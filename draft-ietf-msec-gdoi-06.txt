Abstract 
    
   This document presents an ISAMKP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for 
   group key management to support secure group communications.  The 
   GDOI manages group security associations, which are used by IPSEC and 
   potentially other data security protocols running at the IP or 
   application layers.  These security associations protect one or more 
   key-encrypting keys, traffic-encrypting keys, or data shared by group 
   members.

1.0 Introduction 
    
   This document presents an ISAMKP Domain of Interpretation (DOI) for 
   group key management called the "Group Domain of Interpretation" 
   (GDOI). In this group key management model, the GDOI protocol is run 
   between a group member and a "group controller/key server" (GCKS), 
   which establishes security associations [Section 4.6.2 RFC2401] among 
   authorized group members. ISAKMP defines two "phases" of negotiation

                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   [p.16 RFC2408]. The GDOI MUST be protected by a Phase 1 security 
   association. This document incorporates the Phase 1 security 
   association (SA) definition from the Internet DOI [RFC2407, RFC2409]. 
   Other possible Phase 1 security association types are noted in 
   Appendix A. The Phase 2 exchange is defined in this document, and 
   proposes new payloads and exchanges according to the ISAKMP standard 
   [p. 14 RFC2408]. 
    
   There are six new payloads: 
      1) GDOI SA  
      2) SA KEK (SAK) which follows the SA payload  
      3) SA TEK (SAT) which follows the SA payload  
      4) Key Download Array (KD)  
      5) Sequence number (SEQ) 
      6) Proof of Possession (POP) 
    
   There are two new exchanges. 
    
   1) A Phase 2 exchange creates Re-key and Data-Security Protocol SAs. 
    
   The new Phase 2 exchange, called "GROUPKEY-PULL," downloads keys for 
   a group's "Re-key" SA and/or "Data-security" SA.  The Re-key SA 
   includes a key encrypting key, or KEK, common to the group; a Data-
   security SA includes a data encryption key, or TEK, used by a data-
   security protocol to encrypt or decrypt data traffic [Section 2.1 
   RFC2407].  The SA for the KEK or TEK includes authentication keys, 
   encryption keys, cryptographic policy, and attributes.  The GROUPKEY-
   PULL exchange uses "pull" behavior since the member initiates the 
   retrieval of these SAs from a GCKS.   
     
   2) A datagram subsequently establishes additional Rekey and/or Data-
   Security Protocol SAs. 
     
   The GROUPKEY-PUSH datagram is "pushed" from the GCKS to the members 
   to create or update a Re-key or Data-security SA.  A Re-key SA 
   protects GROUPKEY-PUSH messages.  Thus, a GROUPKEY-PULL is necessary 
   to establish at least one Re-key SA in order to protect subsequent 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH messages.  The GCKS encrypts the GROUPKEY-PUSH message 
   using the KEK Re-key SA.  GDOI accommodates the use of arrays of KEKs 
   for group key management algorithms using the Logical Key Hierarchy 
   (LKH) algorithm to efficiently add and remove group members 
   [RFC2627]. Implementation of the LKH algorithm is OPTIONAL. 
    
   Although the GROUPKEY-PUSH specified by this document can be used to 
   refresh a Re-key SA, the most common use of GROUPKEY-PUSH is to 
   establish a Data-security SA for a data security protocol. GDOI can 
   accommodate future extensions to support a variety of data security 
   protocols. This document only specifies data-security SAs for one 
   security protocol, IPsec ESP. A separate RFC will specify support for 
   other data security protocols such as a future secure Real-time 
   Transport Protocol.  A security protocol uses the TEK and "owns" the 
   data-security SA in the same way that IPsec ESP uses the IKE Phase 2 
   keys and owns the Phase 2 SA; for GDOI, IPsec ESP uses the TEK.

                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
    
    
   Thus, GDOI is a group security association management protocol: All 
   GDOI messages are used to create, maintain, or delete security 
   associations for a group. As described above, these security 
   associations protect one or more key-encrypting keys, traffic-
   encrypting keys, or data shared by group members for multicast and 
   groups-security applications. 
    
   The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, 
   SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL, when they appear in this 
   document, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119]. 
    
    
1.1  GDOI Applications 
    
   Secure multicast applications include video broadcast and multicast 
   file transfer.  In a business environment, many of these applications 
   require network security and may use IPsec ESP to secure their data 
   traffic.  Section 5.4.1 specifies how GDOI carries the needed SA 
   parameters for ESP. In this way, GDOI supports multicast ESP with 
   group authentication of ESP packets using the shared, group key 
   (authentication of unique sources of ESP packets is not possible). 
    
   GDOI can also secure group applications that do not use multicast 
   transport such as video-on-demand.  For example, the GROUPKEY-PUSH 
   message may establish a pair-wise IPsec ESP SA for a member of a 
   subscription group without the need for key management exchanges and 
   costly asymmetric cryptography.   
    
1.2  Extending GDOI 
    
   Not all secure multicast or multimedia applications can use IPsec 
   ESP.  Many Real Time Transport Protocol applications, for example, 
   require security above the IP layer to preserve RTP header 
   compression efficiencies and transport-independence [RFC1889].  A 
   future RTP security protocol may benefit from using GDOI to establish 
   group SAs for multicast and unicast security services.  In order to 
   add a new data security protocol, a new RFC MUST specify the data-
   security SA parameters conveyed by GDOI for that security protocol; 
   these parameters are listed in section 5.4.2 of this document. 
    
2.0 GDOI Phase 1 protocol 
    
   GDOI is a "phase 2" protocol which MUST be protected by a "phase 1" 
   protocol. The "phase 1" protocol can be any protocol which provides 
   for the following protections: 
    
   o Peer Authentication 
   o Confidentiality 
   o Message Integrity

                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   The following sections describe one such "phase 1" protocol. Other 
   protocols which may be potential "phase 1" protocols are described in 
   Appendix A. However the use of the protocols listed there are not 
   considered part of this document. 
    
2.1 ISAKMP Phase 1 protocol 
               
   This document defines how the ISAKMP phase 1 exchanges as defined in 
   [RFC2409] can be used a "phase 1" protocol for GDOI. The following 
   sections define characteristics of the ISAKMP phase 1 protocols that 
   are unique for these exchanges when used for GDOI. 
    
   Section 6.1 describes how the ISAKMP Phase 1 protocols meet the 
   requirements of a GDOI "phase 1" protocol. 
    
 
2.1.1 DOI value 
    
   The Phase 1 SA payload has a DOI value. That value MUST be the GDOI 
   DOI value as defined later in this document. 
    
2.1.2 UDP port. 
    
   GDOI MUST NOT run on port 500 (the port commonly used for IKE). A new 
   port number MUST be defined by IANA for GDOI. 
    
3.0 GROUPKEY-PULL Exchange  
    
   The goal of the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange is to establish a Re-key 
   and/or Data-security SAs at the member for a particular group. A  
   Phase 1 SA protects the GROUPKEY-PULL; there MAY be multiple 
   GROUPKEY-PULL exchanges for a given Phase 1 SA.  The GROUPKEY-PULL 
   exchange downloads the data security keys (TEKs) and/or group key 
   encrypting key (KEK) or KEK array under the protection of the Phase 1 
   SA.  
    
3.1 Authorization 
    
   There are two alternative means for authorizing the GROUPKEY-PULL 
   message.  First, the Phase 1 identity can be used to authorize the 
   Phase 2 (GROUPKEY-PULL) request for a group key.  Second, a new 
   identity can be passed in the GROUPKEY-PULL request.  The new 
   identity could be specific to the group and use a certificate that is 
   signed by the group owner to identify the holder as an authorized 
   group member.  The Proof-of-Possession payload validates that the 
   holder possesses the secret key associated with the Phase 2 identity. 
 
3.2 Messages 
    
   The GROUPKEY-PULL is a Phase 2 exchange.  Phase 1 computes SKEYID_a 
   which is the "key" in the keyed hash used in the GROUPKEY-PULL HASH 
   payloads. When using the Phase 1 defined in this document, SKEYID_a 
   is derived according to [RFC2409].  As with the IKE HASH payload 
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003            6 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   generation [RFC 2409 section 5.5], each GROUPKEY-PULL message hashes 
   a uniquely defined set of values.  Nonces permute the HASH and 
   provide some protection against replay attacks.  Replay protection is 
   important to protect the GCKS from attacks that a key management 
   server will attract. 
      
   The GROUPKEY-PULL uses nonces to guarantee "liveliness", or against 
   replay of a recent GROUPKEY-PULL message.  The replay attack is only 
   useful in the context of the current Phase 1. If a GROUPKEY-PULL 
   message is replayed based on a previous Phase 1, the HASH calculation 
   will fail due to a wrong SKEYID_a. The message will fail processing 
   before the nonce is ever evaluated.  In order for either peer to get 
   the benefit of the replay protection it must postpone as much 
   processing as possible until it receives the message in the protocol 
   that proves the peer is live. For example, the Responder MUST NOT 
   compute the shared Diffie-Hellman number (if KE payloads were 
   included) or install the new SAs until it receives a message with Nr 
   included properly in the HASH payload. 
    
   Nonces require an additional message in the protocol exchange to 
   ensure that the GCKS does not add a group member until it proves 
   liveliness. The GROUPKEY-PULL member-initiator expects to find its 
   nonce, Ni, in the HASH of a returned message. And the GROUPKEY-PULL 
   GKCS responder expects to see its nonce, Nr, in the HASH of a 
   returned message before providing group-keying material as in the 
   following exchange. 
    
           Initiator (Member)                   Responder (GCKS) 
           ------------------                   ---------------- 
           HDR*, HASH(1), Ni, ID     --> 
                                     <--     HDR*, HASH(2), Nr, SA 
           HDR*, HASH(3) [,KE_I]     --> 
              [,CERT] [,POP_I] 
                                     <--     HDR*, HASH(4),[KE_R,][SEQ,] 
                                               KD [,CERT] [,POP_R] 
    
   Hashes are computed as follows: 
       HASH(1) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | Ni | ID) 
       HASH(2) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | Ni_b | Nr | SA) 
       HASH(3) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | Ni_b | Nr_b [ | KE_I ] [ | CERT ] 
                  [ | POP_I ]) 
       HASH(4) = prf(SKEYID_a, M-ID | Ni_b | Nr_b [ | KE_R ] [ | SEQ | ]  
                  KD [ | CERT ] [ | POP_R]) 
    
       POP payload is constructed as described in Section 5.7. 
   * Protected by the Phase 1 SA, encryption occurs after HDR 
    
   HDR is an ISAKMP header payload that uses the Phase 1 cookies and a 
   message identifier (M-ID) as in IKE [RFC2409].  Note that nonces are 
   included in the first two exchanges, with the GCKS returning only the 
   SA policy payload before liveliness is proven. The HASH payloads 
   [RFC2409] prove that the peer has the Phase 1 secret (SKEYID_a) and 
   the nonce for the exchange identified by message id, M-ID.  Once

                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   liveliness is established, the last message completes the real 
   processing of downloading the KD payload.  
     
   In addition to the Nonce and HASH payloads, the member-initiator 
   identifies the group it wishes to join through the ISAKMP ID payload.  
   The GCKS responder informs the member of the current value of the 
   sequence number in the SEQ payload; the sequence number orders the 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams (section 4); the member MUST check to see 
   that the sequence number is greater than in the previous SEQ payload 
   the member holds for the group (if it holds any) before installing 
   any new SAs . The SEQ payload MUST be present if the SA payload 
   contains an SA KEK attribute. The GCKS responder informs the member 
   of the cryptographic policies of the group in the SA payload, which 
   describes the DOI, KEK and/or TEK keying material, and authentication 
   transforms. The SPIs are also determined by the GCKS and downloaded 
   in the SA payload chain (see section 5.2).  The SA KEK attribute 
   contains the ISAKMP cookie pair for the Re-key SA, which is not 
   negotiated but downloaded.  The SA TEK attribute contains an SPI as 
   defined in section 5.4 of this document.  The second message 
   downloads this SA payload. If a Re-key SA is defined in the SA 
   payload, then KD will contain the KEK; if one or more Data-security 
   SAs are defined in the SA payload, KD will contain the TEKs.  This is 
   useful if there is an initial set of TEKs for the particular group 
   and can obviate the need for future TEK GROUPKEY-PUSH messages 
   (described in section 4). 
    
   As described above, the member may establish an identity in the 
   GROUPKEY-PULL exchange in an optional CERT payload that is separate 
   from the Phase 1 identity.  When the member passes a new CERT, a 
   proof of possession (POP) payload accompanies it.  The POP payload 
   demonstrates that the member or GCKS has used the very secret that 
   authenticates it.  POP_I is an ISAKMP SIG payload containing a hash 
   including the nonces Ni and Nr signed by the member, when the member 
   passes a CERT, signed by the Group Owner to prove its authorization.  
   POP_R contains the hash including the concatenated nonces Ni and Nr 
   signed by the GCKS, when the GCKS passes a CERT, signed by the group 
   owner, to prove its authority to provide keys for a particular group.  
   The use of the nonce pair for the POP payload, transformed through a 
   pseudo-random function (prf) and encrypted, is designed to withstand 
   compromise of the Phase 1 key. Implementation of the CERT and POP 
   payloads is OPTIONAL. 
 
3.2.1 Perfect Forward Secrecy 
    
   If PFS is desired and the optional KE payload is used in the 
   exchange, then both sides compute a DH secret and use it to protect 
   the new keying material contained in KD.  The GCKS responder will xor 
   the DH secret with the KD payload and send it to the member 
   Initiator, which recovers the KD by repeating this operation as in 
   the Oakley IEXTKEY procedure [RFC2412]. Implementation of the KE 
   payload is OPTIONAL.

3.2.2 ISAKMP Header Initialization 
    
   Cookies are used in the ISAKMP header as a weak form of denial of 
   service protection.  The GDOI GROUPKEY-PULL exchange uses cookies 
   according to ISAKMP [RFC2408]. 
    
   Next Payload identifies an ISAKMP or GDOI payload (see Section 5.0). 
    
   Major Version is 1 and Minor Version is 0 according to ISAKMP 
   [RFC2408, Section 3.1]. 
    
   The Exchange Type has value 32 for the GDOI GROUPKEY-PULL exchange. 
    
   Flags, Message ID, and Length are according to ISAKMP [RFC2408, 
   Section 3.1] 
    
3.3 Initiator Operations 
    
   Before a group member (GDOI initiator) contacts the GCKS, it must 
   determine the group identifier and acceptable Phase 1 policy via an 
   out-of-band method such as SDP. Phase 1 is initiated using the GDOI 
   DOI in the SA payload. Once Phase 1 is complete the initiator state 
   machine moves to the GDOI protocol. 
    
   To construct the first GDOI message the initiator chooses Ni and 
   creates a nonce payload, builds an identity payload including the 
   group identifier, and generates HASH(1). 
    
   Upon receipt of the second GDOI message, the initiator validates 
   HASH(2), extracts the nonce Nr, and interprets the SA payload. If the 
   policy in the SA payload is acceptable (e.g., the security protocol 
   and cryptographic protocols can be supported by the initiator), the 
   initiator continues the protocol. 
    
   If the group policy uses certificates for authorization, the 
   initiator generates a hash including Ni and Nr and signs it. This 
   becomes the contents of the POP payload. If necessary, a CERT payload 
   is constructed which holds the public key corresponding to the 
   private key used to sign the POP payload.  
    
   The initiator constructs the third GDOI message by including the CERT 
   and POP payloads (if needed) and creating HASH(3). 
    
   Upon receipt of the fourth GDOI messages, the initiator validates 
   HASH(4). If the responder sent CERT and POP_R payloads, the POP 
   signature is validated. 
    
   If a SEQ payload is present, the sequence number in the SEQ payload 
   must be checked against any previously received sequence number for 
   this group. If it is less than the previously received number, it 
   should be considered stale and ignored. This could happen if two 
   GROUPKEY-PULL messages happened in parallel, and the sequence number

                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   changed between the times the results of two GROUPKEY-PULL messages 
   were returned from the GCKS. 
     
   The initiator interprets the KD key packets, matching the SPIs in the 
   key packets to SPIs previously sent in the SA payloads identifying 
   particular policy. For TEKs, once the keys and policy are matched, 
   the initiator is ready to send or receive packets matching the TEK 
   policy.  (If policy and keys had been previously received for this 
   TEK policy, the initiator may decide instead to ignore this TEK 
   policy in case it is stale.) If this group has a KEK, the KEK policy 
   and keys are marked as ready for use. 
    
3.4 Receiver Operations 
    
   The GCKS (responder) passively listens for incoming requests from 
   group members. The Phase 1 authenticates the group member and sets up 
   the secure session with them. 
    
   Upon receipt of the first GDOI message the GCKS validates HASH(1), 
   extracts the Nr and group identifier in the ID payload. It verifies 
   that its database contains the group information for the group 
   identifier. 
    
   The GCKS constructs the second GDOI message, including a nonce Nr, 
   and the policy for the group in an SA payload, followed by SA TEK 
   payloads for traffic SAs, and SA KEK policy (if the group controller 
   will be sending Re-key messages to the group). 
    
   Upon receipt of the third GDOI message the GCKS validates HASH(3). If 
   the initiator sent CERT and POP_I payloads, the POP signature is 
   validated. 
    
   The GCKS constructs the fourth GDOI message, including the SEQ 
   payload (if the GCKS sends rekey messages), the KD payload containing 
   keys corresponding to policy previously sent in the SA TEK and SA KEK 
   payloads, and the CERT and POP payloads (if needed). 
 
    
4.0 GROUPKEY-PUSH Message 
    
   GDOI sends control information securely using group communications. 
   Typically this will be using IP multicast distribution of a GROUPKEY-
   PUSH message but it can also be "pushed" using unicast delivery if IP 
   multicast is not possible.  The GROUPKEY-PUSH message replaces a Re-
   key SA KEK or KEK array, and/or creates a new Data-security SA (see 
   section 1.3).

   * Protected by the Re-key SA KEK; encryption occurs after HDR 
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003           10 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
    
   HDR is defined below. The SEQ payload is defined in the Payloads 
   section.  The SA defines the policy (e.g. protection suite) and 
   attributes (e.g. SPI) for a Re-key and/or Data-security SAs.  The 
   GCKS or delegate optionally provides a CERT payload for verification 
   of the SIG.  KD is the key download payload as described in the 
   Payloads section. 
    
   The SIG payload is a signature of a hash of the entire message before 
   encryption (including the header and excluding the SIG payload 
   itself), prefixed with the string "rekey". The prefixed string 
   ensures that the signature of the Rekey datagram cannot be used for 
   any other purpose in the GDOI protocol. 
    
   If the SA defines an LKH KEK array or single KEK, KD contains a KEK 
   or KEK array for a new Re-key SA, which has a new cookie pair.  When 
   the KD payload carries a new SA KEK attribute (section 5.3), a Re-key 
   SA is replaced with a new SA having the same group identifier (ID 
   specified in message 1 of section 3.1) and incrementing the same 
   sequence counter, which is initialized in message 4 of section 3.1. 
   If the SA defines an SA TEK payload, this informs the member that a 
   new Data-security SA has been created, with keying material carried 
   in KD (Section 5.5). 
    
   If the SA defines a large LKH KEK array (e.g., during group 
   initialization and batched rekeying), parts of the array MAY be sent 
   in different unique GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams. However, each of the 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams MUST be a fully formed GROUPKEY-PUSH 
   datagram. This results in each datagram containing a sequence number 
   and the policy in the SA payload which corresponds to the KEK array 
   portion sent in the KD payload. 
    
4.1 Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) 
    
   The GROUPKEY-PUSH message is protected by the group KEK though in all 
   cases, the GROUPKEY-PUSH message carries new key downloads, among 
   other information.  A freshly generated secret must protect the key 
   download for the GROUPKEY-PUSH message to have PFS.  This issue is 
   for further study. 
    
4.2 Forward and Backward Access Control 
    
   Through GROUPKEY-PUSH, the GDOI supports algorithms such as LKH that 
   have the property of denying access to a new group key by a member 
   removed from the group (forward access control) and to an old group 
   key by a member added to the group (backward access control).  An 
   unrelated notion to PFS, "forward access control" and "backward 
   access control" have been called "perfect forward security" and 
   "perfect backward security" in the literature [RFC2627]. 
    
   Group management algorithms providing forward and backward access 
   control other than LKH have been proposed in the literature, 
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003           11 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   including OFT [OFT]and Subset Difference[NNL]. These algorithms could 
   be used with GDOI, but are not specified as a part of this document. 
    
   Support for group management algorithms is supported via the 
   KEY_MANAGEMENT_ALGORITHM attribute which is sent in the SA_KEK 
   payload. GDOI specifies one method by which LKH can be used for 
   forward and backward access control. Other methods of using LKH, as 
   well as other group management algorithms such as OFT or Subset 
   Difference, may be added to GDOI as part of a later document. Any 
   such addition MUST be due to a Standards Action as defined in 
   [RFC2434]. 
    
4.2.1 Forward Access Control Requirements 
    
   When group membership is altered using a group management algorithm 
   new SA_TEKs (and their associated keys) are usually also needed. New 
   SAs and keys ensure that members who were denied access can no longer 
   participate in the group. 
    
   If forward access control is a desired property of the group, new 
   SA_TEKs and the associated key packets in the KD payload MUST NOT be 
   included in a GROUPKEY-PUSH message which changes group membership. 
   This is required because the SA_TEK policy and the associated key 
   packets in the KD payload are not protected with the new KEK. A 
   second GROUPKEY-PUSH message can deliver the new SA_TEKS and their 
   associated keys because it will be protected with the new KEK, and 
   thus will not be visible to the members who were denied access. 
    
   If forward access control policy for the group includes keeping group 
   policy changes from members that are denied access to the group, then 
   two sequential GROUPKEY-PUSH messages changing the group KEK MUST be 
   sent by the GCKS. The first GROUPKEY-PUSH message creates a new KEK 
   for the group. Group members which are denied access will not be able 
   to access the new KEK, but will see the group policy since the 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message is protected under the current KEK. A 
   subsequent GROUPKEY-PUSH message containing the changed group policy 
   and again changing the KEK allows complete forward access control. A 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message MUST NOT change the policy without creating a 
   new KEK. 
    
   If other methods of using LKH or other group management algorithms 
   are added to GDOI, those methods MAY remove the above restrictions 
   requiring multiple GROUPKEY-PUSH messages, providing those methods 
   specify how forward access control policy is maintained within a 
   single GROUPKEY-PUSH message. 
    
4.3 Delegation of Key Management 
    
   GDOI supports delegation of GROUPKEY-PUSH datagrams through the 
   delegation capabilities of the PKI. However, GDOI does not explicitly 
   specify how the GCKS identifies delegates, but leaves this to the PKI 
   that is used by a particular GDOI implementation.

                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
4.4 Use of signature keys 
    
   The GCKS SHOULD NOT use the same key to sign the SIG payload in the 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message as was used for authorization in the GROUPKEY-
   PULL POP payload. If the same key must be used, a different hash 
   function SHOULD be used as a base for the POP payload than is used as 
   a base for the SIG payload. 
    
4.5 ISAKMP Header Initialization 
    
   Unlike ISAKMP or IKE, the cookie pair is completely determined by the 
   GCKS. The cookie pair in the GDOI ISAKMP header identifies the Re-key 
   SA to differentiate the secure groups managed by a GCKS.  Thus, GDOI 
   uses the cookie fields as an SPI 
    
   Next Payload identifies an ISAKMP or GDOI payload (see Section 5.0). 
    
   Major Version is 1 and Minor Version is 0 according to ISAKMP 
   [RFC2408, Section 3.1]. 
    
   The Exchange Type has value 33 for the GDOI GROUPKEY-PUSH message. 
    
   Flags MUST have the Encryption bit set according to [RFC2008, Section 
   3.1]. All other bits MUST be set to zero. 
    
   Message ID MUST be set to zero. 
     
   Length is according to ISAKMP [RFC2408, Section 3.1] 
    
4.6 Deletion of SAs 
    
   There are times the GCKS may want to signal to receivers to delete 
   SAs, for example at the end of a broadcast. Deletion of keys may be 
   accomplished by sending an ISAKMP Delete payload [RFC2408, Section 
   3.15] as part of a GDOI GROUPKEY-PUSH message. 
    
   One or more Delete payloads MAY be placed following the SEQ payload 
   in a GROUPKEY-PUSH message. If a GCKS has no further SAs to send to 
   group members, the SA and KD payloads MUST be omitted from the 
   message. 
    
   The following fields of the Delete Payload are further defined as 
   follows: 
    
   o The Domain of Interpretation field contains the GDOI DOI. 
    
   o The Protocol-Id field contains TEK protocol id values defined in 
   Section 5.4 of this document. To delete a KEK SA, the value of zero 
   MUST be used as the protocol id. Note that only one protocol id value 
   can be defined in a Delete payload. If a TEK SA and a KEK SA must be 
   deleted, they must be sent in different Delete payloads.

4.7 GCKS Operations 
    
   GCKS or its delegate may initiate a Rekey message for one of several 
   reasons, e.g. the group membership has changed or keys are due to 
   expire. 
    
   To begin the rekey datagram the GCKS builds an ISAKMP HDR with the 
   correct cookie pair, and a SEQ payload that includes a sequence 
   number which is one greater than the previous rekey datagram.  
    
   An SA payload is then added. This is identical in structure and 
   meaning to a SA payload sent in a GROUPKEY-PULL exchange. If there 
   are changes to the KEK (in the case of a static KEK) or in group 
   membership (in the case of LKH) an SA_KEK attribute is added to the 
   SA. If there are one or more new TEKs then SA_TEK attributes are 
   added to describe that policy. 
    
   A KD payload is then added. This is identical in structure and 
   meaning to a KD payload sent in a GROUPKEY-PULL exchange. If an 
   SA_KEK attribute was included in the SA payload then corresponding 
   KEK keys (or a KEK array) is included. TEK keys are sent for each 
   SA_TEK attribute included in the SA payload. 
    
   A CERT payload is added if the initiator needs to provide its 
   certificate. 
    
   In the penultimate step the initiator hashes the string "rekey" 
   followed by the key management message already formed. The hash is 
   signed, placed in a SIG payload and added to the datagram.  
    
   Lastly the payloads following the HDR are encrypted using the current 
   KEK encryption key. The datagram can now be sent.  
    
4.8 Group Member Operations 
    
   A group member receiving the GROUPKEY-PUSH datagram matches the 
   cookie pair in the ISAKMP HDR to an existing SA. The message is 
   decrypted, and the form of the datagram is validated. This weeds out 
   obvious ill-formed messages (which may be sent as part of a Denial of 
   Service attack on the group). 
    
   The signature of the decrypted message is then validated, possibly 
   using the CERT payload if it is included. 
    
   The sequence number in the SEQ payload is validated to ensure that it 
   is greater than the previously received sequence number, and that it 
   fits within a window of acceptable values. 
    
   The SA and KD payloads are processed which results in a new GDOI 
   Rekey SA (if the SA payload included an SA_KEK attribute) and/or new 
   IPsec SAs being added to the system.

5.1 Identification Payload 
    
   The Identification Payload is used to identify a group identity that 
   will later be associated with Security Associations for the group. A 
   group identity may map to a specific IP multicast group, or may 
   specify a more general identifier, such as one that represents a set 
   of related multicast streams. 
    
   The Identification Payload is defined as follows: 
    
       0                   1                   2                   3

   the next payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last 
   in the message, this field will be zero (0).

5.1.1.1 ID_KEY_ID 
   In the context of a GDOI ID payload, ID_KEY_ID specifies a four (4)-
   octet group identifier. 
    
5.2 Security Association Payload 
    
   The Security Association payload is defined in RFC 2408. For the 
   GDOI, it is used by the GCKS to assert security attributes for both 
   Re-key and Data-security SAs 
      0                   1                   2                   3

   The Security Association Payload fields are defined as follows: 
    
       o Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifies the next payload for the 
   GROUPKEY-PULL or the GROUPKEY-PUSH message as defined above. The next

   payload MUST NOT be a SAK Payload or SAT Payload type, but the next 
   non-Security Association type payload. 
    
       o RESERVED (1 octet) - Must be zero. 
    
       o Payload Length (2 octets) is the octet length of the current 
   payload including the generic header and all TEK and KEK payloads. 
    
       o DOI (4 octets) - Is the GDOI, which is value 196 pending 
   assignment by the IANA. 
    
       o Situation (4 octets) - Must be zero. 
    
       o SA Attribute Next Payload (1 octet) - Must be either a SAK 
   Payload or a SAT Payload. See section 5.3.2 for a description of 
   which circumstances are required for each payload type to be present. 
    
       o RESERVED (2 octets) - Must be zero. 
    
5.2.1 Payloads following the SA payload 
    
   Payloads that define specific security association attributes for the 
   KEK and/or TEKs used by the group MUST follow the SA payload. How 
   many of each payload is dependant upon the group policy. There may be 
   zero or one SAK Payloads, and zero or more SAT Payloads, where either 
   one SAK or SAT payload MUST be present. 
    
   This latitude allows for various group policies to be accommodated.  
   For example if the group policy does not require the use of a Re-key 
   SA, the GCKS would not need to send an SA KEK attribute to the group 
   member since all SA updates would be performed using the Registration 
   SA. Alternatively, group policy might use a Re-key SA but choose to 
   download a KEK to the group member only as part of the Registration 
   SA. Therefore, the KEK policy (in the SA KEK attribute) would not be 
   necessary as part of the Re-key SA message SA payload. 
    
   Specifying multiple SATs allows multiple sessions to be part of the 
   same group and multiple streams to be associated with a session 
   (e.g., video, audio, and text) but each with individual security 
   association policy. 
    
5.3 SA KEK payload 
    
   The SA KEK (SAK) payload contains security attributes for the KEK 
   method for a group and parameters specific to the GROUPKEY-PULL 
   operation. The source and destination identities describe the 
   identities used for the GROUPKEY-PULL datagram.

   Besides ESP, GDOI should serve to establish SAs for secure groups 
   needed by other Security Protocols that operate at the transport, 
   application, and internetwork layers.  These other Security 
   Protocols, however, are in the process of being developed or do not 
   yet exist.   
    
   The following information needs to be provided for a Security 
   Protocol to the GDOI.  
    
      o The Protocol-ID for the particular Security Protocol 
      o The SPI Size 
      o The method of SPI generation 
      o The transforms, attributes and keys needed by the Security  
   Protocol 
    
   All Security Protocols must provide the information in the bulleted 
   list above to guide the GDOI implementation for that protocoland  
   will be specified in separate documents.   
    
5.5 Key Download Payload 
    
   The Key Download Payload contains group keys for the group specified 
   in the SA Payload.  These key download payloads can have several 
   security attributes applied to them based upon the security policy of 
   the group as defined by the associated SA Payload. 
    
   When included as part of the Re-key SA with an optional KE payload, 
   The Key Download Payload will be xor'ed with the new Diffie-Hellman 
   shared secret. The xor operation will begin at the "Number of Key 
   Packets" field.

5.5.1 TEK Download Type 
    
   The following attributes may be present in a SAT Payload. Exactly one 
   attribute matching each type sent in the SAT payload MUST be present.  
   The attributes must follow the format defined in ISAKMP [RFC2408]

   marked as Basic (B); attributes which are defined as TLV are marked 
   as Variable (V). 
    
             TEK Class                 Value      Type 
             ---------                 -----      ----

             TEK_SOURCE_AUTH_KEY          3        V 
    
    
If no TEK key packets are included in a Registration KD payload, the 
group member can expect to receive the TEK as part of a Re-key SA.  At 
least one TEK must be included in each Re-key KD payload.  Multiple TEKs 
may be included if multiple streams associated with the SA are to be 
rekeyed. 
 
5.5.1.1 TEK_ALGORITHM_KEY 
    
   The TEK_ALGORITHM_KEY class declares that the encryption key for this 
   SPI is contained as the Key Packet Attribute. The encryption 
   algorithm that will use this key was specified in the SAT payload. 
    
   In the case that the algorithm requires multiple keys (e.g., 3DES), 
   all keys will be included in one attribute. 
    
   DES keys will consist of 64 bits (the 56 key bits with parity bit).  
   Triple DES keys will be specified as a single 192 bit attribute 
   (including parity bits) in the order that the keys are to be used for 
   encryption (e.g., DES_KEY1, DES_KEY2, DES_KEY3). 
    
5.5.1.2 TEK_INTEGRITY_KEY 
    
   The TEK_INTEGRITY_KEY class declares that the integrity key for this 
   SPI is contained as the Key Packet Attribute. The integrity algorithm 
   that will use this key was specified in the SAT payload.  Thus GDOI 
   assumes that both the symmetric encryption and integrity keys are 
   pushed to the member. SHA keys will consist of 160 bits, and MD5 keys 
   will consist of 128 bits. 
    
5.5.1.3 TEK_SOURCE_AUTH_KEY 
    
   The TEK_SOURCE_AUTH_KEY class declares that the source authentication 
   key for this SPI is contained in the Key Packet Attribute. The source 
   authentication algorithm that will use this key was specified in the 
   SAT payload.

   The following attributes may be present in a SAK Payload. Exactly one 
   attribute matching each type sent in the SAK payload MUST be present.  
   The attributes must follow the format defined in ISAKMP [RFC2408] 
   section 3.3. In the table, attributes which are defined as TV are 
   marked as Basic (B); attributes which are defined as TLV are marked 
   as Variable (V).

             SIG_ALGORITHM_KEY            2        V 
    
   If the KEK key packet is included, there MUST be only one present in 
   the KD payload. 
    
5.5.2.1 KEK_ALGORITHM_KEY 
    
   The KEK_ALGORITHM_KEY class declares the encryption key for this SPI 
   is contained in the Key Packet Attribute. The encryption algorithm 
   that will use this key was specified in the SAK payload. 
    
   If the mode of operation for the algorithm requires an Initialization 
   Vector (IV), an explicit IV MUST be included in the KEK_ALGORITHM_KEY 
   before the actual key. 
    
5.5.2.2 SIG_ALGORITHM_KEY 
    
   The SIG_ALGORITHM_KEY class declares that the public key for this SPI 
   is contained in the Key Packet Attribute, which may be useful when no 
   public key infrastructure is available. The signature algorithm that 
   will use this key was specified in the SAK payload. 
    
5.5.3 LKH Download Type 
    
   The LKH key packet is comprised of attributes representing different 
   leaves in the LKH key tree.  
    
   The following attributes are used to pass an LKH KEK array in the KD 
   payload. The attributes must follow the format defined in ISAKMP 
   [RFC2408] section 3.3. In the table, attributes which are defined as 
   TV are marked as Basic (B); attributes which are defined as TLV are 
   marked as Variable (V). 
    
             KEK Class                 Value      Type

   If an LKH key packet is included in the KD payload, there must be 
   only one present. 
    
5.5.3.1 LKH_DOWNLOAD_ARRAY 
    
   This attribute is used to download a set of keys to a group member. 
   It MUST NOT be included in a GROUPKEY-PUSH message KD payload if the 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH is sent to more than the group member. If an 
   LKH_DOWNLOAD_ARRAY attribute is included in a KD payload, there must 
   be only one present. 
    
This attribute consists of a header block, followed by one or more LKH 
keys.

   to uniquely identify a key within an LKH ID. 
    
       o Key Data (variable length)  -- This is the actual encryption 
   key data, which is dependent on the Key Type algorithm for its 
   format. If the mode of operation for the algorithm requires an 
   Initialization Vector (IV), an explicit IV MUST be included in the 
   Key Data field before the actual key. 
    
   The Key Creation Date and Key expiration Dates MAY be zero. This is 
   necessary in the case where time synchronization within the group is 
   not possible. 
    
   The first LKH Key structure in an LKH_DOWNLOAD_ARRAY attribute

   LKH Key is encrypted under the key defined by the LKH ID and Key 
   Handle found in the LKH_UPDATE_ARRAY header. 
 
   5.5.3.3 SIG_ALGORITHM_KEY  
        
   The SIG_ALGORITHM_KEY class declares that the public key for this SPI  
   is contained in the Key Packet Attribute, which may be useful when no  
   public key infrastructure is available. The signature algorithm that  
   will use this key was specified in the SAK payload. 
    
5.6 Sequence Number Payload 
    
   The Sequence Number Payload (SEQ) provides an anti-replay protection 
   for GROUPKEY-PUSH messages. Its use is similar to the Sequence Number 
   field defined in the IPsec ESP protocol [RFC2406].

                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
    
   The Sequence Number Payload fields are defined as follows: 
    
       o Next Payload (1 octet) - Identifier for the payload type of the 
   next payload in the message.  If the current payload is the last in 
   the message, then this field will be zero. 
    
       o  RESERVED (1 octet) - Unused, set to zero. 
    
       o  Payload Length (2 octets) - Length in octets of the current 
   payload, including the generic payload header. 
    
       o Sequence Number (4 octets) - This field contains a 
   monotonically increasing counter value for the group. It is 
   initialized to zero by the GCKS, and incremented in each 
   subsequently-transmitted message.  Thus the first packet sent for a 
   given Rekey SA will have a Sequence Number of 1. The GDOI 
   implementation keeps a sequence counter as an attribute for the Rekey 
   SA and increments the counter upon receipt of a GROUPKEY-PUSH 
   message. The current value of the sequence number must be transmitted 
   to group members as a part of the Registration SA SA payload.  A 
   group member must keep a sliding receive window. The window must be 
   treated as in the ESP protocol [RFC2406] Section 3.4.3. 
    
5.7 Proof of Possession 
    
   The Proof of Possession Payload is used as part of group membership 
   authorization during a GDOI exchange. The Proof of Possession Payload 
   is identical to an ISAKMP SIG payload. However, the usage is entirely 
   different. 
    
   The GCKS, GCKS delegate or member signs a hash of the following 
   values: 
        POP_HASH = hash("pop" | Ni | Nr) 
   Where hash() is the hash function used with the signature. 
    
   The "pop" prefix  ensures that the signature of the POP payload 
   cannot be used for any other purpose in the GDOI protocol. 
    
5.8 Nonce 
    
   The data portion of the Nonce payload (i.e., Ni_b and Nr_b included 
   in the HASHs) MUST be a value between 8 and 128 bytes. 
    
6.0 Security Considerations 
    
   GDOI is a security association (SA) management protocol for groups 
   of senders and receivers.  Unlike a data security protocol, SA 
   management includes a key establishment protocol to securely 
   establish keys at communication endpoints.  This protocol performs 
   entity authentication of the GDOI member or Group Controller/Key 
   Server (GCKS), it provides confidentiality of key management 
   messages, and it provides source authentication of those messages.  
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003           32 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   This protocol also uses best-known practices for defense against 
   man-in-middle, connection hijacking, replay, reflection, and denial-
   of-service (DOS) attacks on unsecured networks [STS, RFC2522, 
   SKEME].  GDOI assumes the network is not secure and may be under the 
   complete control of an attacker. 
    
   GDOI assumes that the host computer is secure even though the 
   network is insecure.  GDOI ultimately establishes keys among members 
   of a group, which MUST be trusted to use those keys in an authorized 
   manner according to group policy.  The security of GDOI, therefore, 
   is as good as the degree to which group members can be trusted to 
   protect authenticators, encryption keys, decryption keys, and 
   message authentication keys. 
    
   There are three phases of GDOI as described in this document: an 
   ISAKMP Phase 1 protocol, a new exchange called GROUPKEY-PULL which 
   is protected by the ISAKMP Phase 1 protocol, and a new message 
   called GROUPKEY-PUSH. Each phase is considered separately below. 
    
6.1 ISAKMP Phase 1 
    
   As described in this document, GDOI uses the Phase 1 exchanges 
   defined in [RFC2409] to protect the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange. Therefore 
   all security properties and considerations of those exchanges (as 
   noted in [RFC2409]) are relevant for GDOI. 
    
   GDOI may inherit the problems of its ancestor protocols [FS00], such 
   as identity exposure, absence of unidirectional authentication, or 
   stateful cookies [PK01].  GDOI could benefit, however, from 
   improvements to its ancestor protocols just as it benefits from 
   years of experience and work embodied in those protocols.  To reap 
   the benefits of future IKE improvements, however, GDOI would need to 
   be revised in a future standards-track RFC, which is beyond the 
   scope of this specification. 
    
6.1.1 Authentication 
    
   Authentication is provided via the mechanisms defined in [RFC2409], 
   namely Pre-Shared Keys or Public Key encryption. 
    
6.1.2 Confidentiality 
    
   Confidentiality is achieved in Phase 1 through a Diffie-Hellman 
   exchange that provides keying material, and through negotiation of 
   encryption transforms. 
    
   The Phase 1 protocol will be protecting encryption and integrity 
   keys sent in the GROUPKEY-PULL protocol. The strength of the 
   encryption used for Phase 1 SHOULD exceed that of the keys send in 
   the GROUPKEY-PULL protocol. 
    
6.1.3 Man-in-the-Middle Attack Protection 
    
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003           33 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   A successful man-in-the-middle or connection-hijacking attack foils 
   entity authentication of one or more of the communicating entities 
   during key establishment.  GDOI relies on Phase 1 authentication to 
   defeat man-in-the-middle attacks. 
    
6.1.4 Replay/Reflection Attack Protection 
    
   In a replay/reflection attack, an attacker captures messages between 
   GDOI entities and subsequently forwards them to a GDOI entity.  
   Replay and reflection attacks seek to gain information from a 
   subsequent GDOI message response or seek to disrupt the operation of 
   a GDOI member or GCKS entity. GDOI relies on the Phase 1 nonce 
   mechanism in combination with a hash-based message authentication 
   code to protect against the replay or reflection of previous key 
   management messages. 
    
6.1.5 Denial of Service Protection 
    
   A denial of service attacker sends messages to a GDOI entity to 
   cause that entity to perform unneeded message authentication 
   operations.  GDOI uses the Phase 1 cookie mechanism to identify 
   spurious messages prior to cryptographic hash processing.  This is a 
   "weak" form of denial of service protection in that the GDOI entity 
   must check for good cookies, which can be successfully imitated by a 
   sophisticated attacker.  The Phase 1 cookie mechanism is stateful, 
   and commits memory resources for cookies, but stateless cookies are 
   a better defense against denial of service attacks. 
    
    
6.2 GROUPKEY-PULL Exchange 
        
   The GROUPKEY-PULL exchange allows a group member to request SAs and 
   keys from a GCKS. It runs as a "phase 2" protocol under protection 
   of the Phase 1 security association. 
    
6.2.1 Authentication 
    
   Peer authentication is not required in the GROUPKEY-PULL protocol. 
   It is running in the context of the Phase 1 protocol, which has 
   previously authenticated the identity of the peer. 
    
   Message authentication is provided by HASH payloads in each message, 
   where the HASH is defined to be over SKEYID_a (derived in the Phase 
   1 exchange), the ISAKMP Message-ID, and all payloads in the message. 
   Because only the two endpoints of the exchange know the SKEYID_a 
   value, this provides confidence that the peer sent the message. 
    
6.2.2 Confidentiality 
    
   Confidentiality is provided by the Phase 1 security association, 
   after the manner described in [RFC2409]. 
    
    
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003           34 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
    
6.2.3 Man-in-the-Middle Attack Protection 
    
   Message authentication (described above) includes a secret known 
   only to the group member and GCKS when constructing a HASH payload. 
   This prevents 
   man-in-the-middle and connection-hijacking attacks because an 
   attacker would not be able to change the message undetected. 
    
6.2.4 Replay/Reflection Attack Protection 
    
                                      
   Nonces provide freshness of the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange. The group 
   member and GCKS exchange nonce values first two messages. These 
   nonces are included in subsequent HASH payload calculations. The 
   Group member and GCKS MUST NOT perform any computationally expensive 
   tasks before receiving a HASH with its own nonce included. The GCKS 
   MUST NOT update the group management state (e.g., LKH key tree) 
   until it receives the third message in the exchange with a valid 
   HASH payload including its own nonce. 
    
   Implementations SHOULD keep a record of recently received GROUPKEY-
   PULL messages and reject messages that have already been processed. 
   This enables an early discard of the replayed messages. 
 
6.2.5 Denial of Service Protection 
 
   A GROUPKEY-PULL message identifies its messages using a cookie pair 
   from the Phase 1 exchange that precedes it. The cookies provide a 
   weak form of denial of service protection as described above, in the 
   sense that a GROUPKEY-PULL message with invalid cookies will be 
   discarded. 
    
   The replay protection mechanisms described above provide the basis 
   for denial of service protection.  
    
6.2.5 Authorization 
 
     The CERT payload in a GROUPKEY-PULL exchange allows a group member 
   or GCKS to submit a certificate containing authorization attributes 
   to the peer as well as identifying = a public/private key pair. The 
   GROUPKEY-PULL POP payload enables authorization to be accomplished 
   where the authorization infrastructure is different than the 
   GROUPKEY-PULL authentication infrastructure by proving 
   that it is in possession of the private key  
    
6.3 GROUPKEY-PUSH Exchange 
 
   The GROUPKEY-PUSH exchange is a single message that allows a GCKS to 
   send SAs and keys to group members. This is likely to be sent to all 
   members using an IP multicast group. This provides an efficient 
   rekey and group membership adjustment capability. 
    
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003           35 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
6.3.1 Authentication 
    
   The GROUPKEY-PULL exchange identifies a public key that is used for 
   message authentication. The GROUPKEY-PUSH message is digitally 
   signed using the corresponding private key held by the GCKS or its 
   delegate. This digital signature provides source authentication for 
   the message. Thus, GDOI protects the GCKS from impersonation in 
   group environments.   
    
6.3.2 Confidentiality 
 
   The GCKS encrypts the GROUPKEY-PUSH message with an encryption key 
   that was established by the GROUPKEY-PULL exchange. 
    
6.3.3 Man-in-the-Middle Attack Protection 
    
   This combination of confidentiality and message authentication 
   services protects the GROUPKEY-PUSH message from man-in-middle and 
   connection-hijacking attacks. 
    
6.3.4 Replay/Reflection Attack Protection 
    
   The GROUPKEY-PUSH message includes a monotonically increasing 
   sequence number to protect against replay and reflection attacks. A 
   group member will recognize a replayed message by comparing the 
   sequence number to a sliding window, in the same manner as the ESP 
   protocol uses sequence numbers. 
    
   Implementations SHOULD keep a record of recently received GROUPKEY-
   PUSH messages and reject messages which have already been processed. 
   This enables an early discard of the replayed messages. 
 
    
6.3.5 Denial of Service Protection 
    
   A cookie pair identifies the security association for the GROUPKEY-
   PUSH message.  The cookies thus serve as a weak form of denial-of-
   service protection for the GROUPKEY-PUSH message.   
    
   The digital signature used for message authentication has a much 
   greater computational cost than a message authentication code and 
   could amplify the effects of a denial of service attack on GDOI 
   members who process GROUPKEY-PUSH messages.  The added cost of 
   digital signatures is justified by the need to prevent GCKS 
   impersonation:  If a shared symmetric key were used for GROUPKEY-
   PUSH message authentication, then GCKS source authentication would 
   be impossible and any member would be capable of GCKS impersonation 
    
   The potential of the digital signature amplifying a denial of 
   service attack is mitigated by the order of operations a group 
   member takes, where the least expensive cryptographic operation is 
   performed first. The group member first decrypts the message using a 
   symmetric cipher. If it is a validly formed message then the 
     
   Baugher, et. al. Standards Track - Expires April, 2003           36 
                  The GDOI Domain of Interpretation     October, 2002 
    
    
   sequence number is checked against the replay window. Only if the 
   sequence number is valid is the digital signature verified. Thus in 
   order for a denial of service attack to be mounted, an attacker 
   would need to know both the symmetric encryption key used for 
   confidentiality, and a valid sequence number. Generally speaking 
   this means only current group members can effectively deploy a 
   denial of service attack. 
    
6.3.6 Forward Access Control 
    
   If a group management algorithm (such as LKH) is used, forward 
   access control may not be ensured if some cases. This can happen if 
   some group members are denied access to the group in the same 
   GROUPKEY-PUSH message as new policy and TEKs are delivered to the 
   group. As discussed in Section 4.2.1, forward access control can be 
   maintained by sending multiple GROUPKEY-PUSH messages, where the 
   group membership changes are sent from the GCKS separate from the 
   new policy and TEKs. 
    
 
    
7.0 IANA Considerations 
    
7.1 ISAKMP DOI 
    
   A new ISAKMP DOI number needs to be assigned to GDOI. RFC 2407 
   indicates that the namespace for DOI values is in STD-2, although 
   that does not yet exist such as section there. The present document 
   is in accordance with the "Supported Security Protocols" section in 
   [RFC2408]. 
    
7.2 Payload Types 
    
   New ISAKMP Next Payload types need to be allocated for GDOI payload 
   types. No ISAKMP registry for payload types currently exists, but the 
   Private Use payload type namespace can be further partitioned for the 
   GDOI DOI. See Section 5.0 for the payloads defined in this document. 
    
7.3 New Name spaces 
    
   The present document describes many new name spaces for use in the 
   GDOI payloads. Those may be found in subsections under Section 5.0. A 
   new GDOI registry should be created for these name spaces. 
    
   Portions of name spaces marked "RESERVED" are reserved for IANA 
   allocation. New values MUST be added due to a Standards Action as 
   defined in [RFC2434].  
    
   Portions of name spaces marked "Private Use" may be allocated by 
   implementations for their own purposes. 
    
7.4 UDP Port 
   A new UDP port is required for GDOI.

Appendix A: Alternate GDOI Phase 1 protocols 
    
   This section describes a manner in which other protocols could be 
   used as GDOI Phase 1 protocols in place of the ISAKMP Phase 1 
   protocol. However, they are not specified as a part of this document. 
   A separate document MUST be written in order for another protocol to 
   be used as a GDOI Phase 1 protocol. 
    
   Other possible phase 1 protocols are also described in [GKMARCH]. 
    
   Any GDOI phase 1 protocol MUST satisfy the requirements specified in 
   Section 2 of this document. 
 
A.1 IKEv2 Phase 1 protocol 
    
   Version 2 of the IKE protocol (IKEv2) is a work in progress [IKEv2]. 
   That protocol seeks to simplify the IKE Phase 1 and Phase 2 
   protocols, and improve the security of the IKE protocol. An IKEv2 
   Phase 1 negotiates an IPSEC SA during phase 1, which was not possible 
   in IKE. However, IKEv2 also defines a phase 2 protocol. The phase 2 
   protocol is protected by the Phase 1, similar in concept to how IKE 
   Quick Mode is protected by the IKE Phase 1 protocols in [RFC2409]. 
    
   IKEv2 may not include a DOI value in the SA payload. However, since 
   GDOI uses a unique port, choice of a phase 2 protocol in the SA 
   payload using a GDOI value is not necessary. It is expected that an 
   IKEv2 Phase 1 protocol definition could be run on the GDOI port. The

   SA payload in the protocol would be specific to GDOI, or omitted if 
   not needed at all. 
    
   The GROUPKEY-PULL protocol would follow the IKEv2 Phase 1 protocol in 
   the same manner as described in this document. 
    
A.2 KINK Protocol 
                         
   A work in progress [KINK] has defined a method of encapsulating an 
   IKE Quick Mode [RFC2409] encapsulated in Kerberos KRB_AP_REQ and 
   KRB_AP_REP payloads. KINK provides a low-latency, computationally 
   inexpensive, easily managed, and cryptographically sound method of 
   setting up IPSec security associations. 
 
   The KINK message format includes a GDOI field in the KINK header. The 
   [KINK] document defines the DOI for the IPSEC DOI. 
    
   A new DOI for KINK could be defined which would encapsulate a 
   GROUPKEY-PULL exchange in the Kerberos KRB_AP_REQ and KRB_AP_REP 
   payloads. As such, GDOI would benefit from the computational 
   efficiencies of KINK.
