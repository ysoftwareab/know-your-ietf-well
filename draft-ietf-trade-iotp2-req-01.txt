Abstract

   Verion 2 of the Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) will extend the
   interoperable framework for Internet commerce capabilities of Version
   1 while replacing the XML messaging and digitial signature part of
   IOTP v1 with standards based mechanisms. Additional features are
   listed and divided into those the will, may, and will not be
   included.

INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP v2 Requirements               August 2001


1. Introduction

   Verion 2 of the Internet Open Trading Protocol (IOTP) will extend the
   interoperable framework for Internet commerce capabilities of Version
   1 [RFC 2801] as described in Section 3 below.  In addition, it will
   replace the ad hoc XML messaging and digitial signature [RFC 2802]
   parts of IOTP v1 with standards based mechanisms [RFC 3075].

   This draft gives requirements for IOTP Version 2 by describing design
   principles and scope and dividing features into those which will,
   may, or will not be included.



2. Design Principles and Scope

   1. The specification must describe the syntax and processing
      necessary for an extension of the interoperable framework for
      Internet commerce described in IOTP V1.0 [RFC 2801].

   2. Keep changes to IOTP V1.0 to a minimum.

   3. Maintain all existing functionality of IOTP V1.0.

   4. Test all XML DTDs and/or Schmeas and XML examples in the
      specification to insure that they are well-formed.

   5. Create usage/implementation guidance information, probably as a
      separate document.

   6. It should be designed to work well with other protocols such as
      ECML [RFC 3106].

   7. IOTP Version 2 should be developed as part of the broader Web
      design philosophy of decentralization, URIs, Web data, and
      modularity /layering / extensibility. [Berners-Lee, WebData] In
      this context, this standard should take advantage of existing
      provider (and infrastructure) primitives.



3. Requirements

   IOTP Version 2 will include the following:

   1. Be a superset of IOTP Version 1.

   2. Provide for the Dynamic Definition of Trading Sequences. I.E.,
      transactions will not be limited, as with v1, to a single payment
      and a single delivery with delivery occuring after payment.

INTERNET-DRAFT            IOTP v2 Requirements               August 2001


      Instead, it will be possible to propose an arbitrary sequence of
      transaction steps.

   3. Include specification of an Offer Request Block.

   4. Support Improved Problem Resolution (extend to cover presentation
      of signed receipt to customer support party, better defined
      Customer Care role, etc.)

   5. Add provisions to indicate and handle a payment protocol not
      tunneled through IOTP.

   6. Add support for server based wallets.

   The following may be include in IOTP v2:

   1. Support Repeated/ongoing payments. For example, a means to specify
      that a customer approval covers not only the instant purchase but
      also some limited number of future purchase with some total or per
      purchase spending limit.

   2. Enhanced Server to Server messages. For example, a means for a
      Delivery Handler to inform a Payment Handler that goods have
      actually shipped, which may be a pre-condition for making a charge
      against a credit card.

   3. Include the ability to add both fields and attributes to existing
      trading blocks in addition to the present ability to add entirely
      new trading blocks.

   The following are out of scope for IOTP version 2:

   1. Legal or regulatory issues surrounding the implementation of the
      protocol or information systems using it.

   2. Design of an XML Messaging Layer. Instead, whatever is or appears
      most likely to become the standard XML messaging layer will be
      used.  This includes a standard enveloping, addressing, and error
      reporting framework.

   3. Design of XML Digitial Signatures. Instead, the existing standard
      [RFC 3075] will be used.



4. Security Considerations

   As provided above, IOTP v2 will provide optional authentication via
   standards based XML Digitial Signatures [RFC 3075]; however, neither
   IOTP v1 nor v2 provide a confidentiality mechanism.  Both require the

   use of secure channels such as those provided by TLS [RFC 2246] or
   IPSEC for confidentiality and depend on the security mechanisms of
   any payment system used in conjuction with them to secure payments.
