Abstract

   This document defines additional Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TPv3)
   bit values to be used within the "Circuit Status" Attribute-Value
   Pair (AVP) to communicate more granular error states for Access
   Circuits and Pseudowires.

Internet-Draft    L2TPv3 Extended Circuit Status Values         Jan 2008


1.  Introduction

   Currently the L2TPv3 Circuit Status AVP [RFC3931] is able to convey
   the UP/DOWN status of an access circuit.  However, a finer
   granularity is often useful to determine the direction of the fault
   as has been added for MPLS-based pseudowires, see [RFC4446].

   Additionally, it is useful (in redundancy scenarios) to be able to
   indicate if a pseudowire is in a standby state, where it is fully
   established but is not switching data.  Again, such functionality is
   available for MPLS based pseudowires, see
   [I-D.muley-dutta-pwe3-redundancy-bit].

   The proposal is to provide extended circuit status bit values for
   L2TPv3 and to add them in a manner such that it is backwards
   compatible with the current Circuit Status AVP.  These new bits are
   applicable to all pseudowires types.

1.1.  Specification of Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  L2TP Extended Circuit Status Values

   The Circuit Status AVP (ICRQ, ICRP, ICCN, OCRQ, OCRP, OCCN, SLI),
   Attribute Type 71, indicates the initial status of or a status change
   in the access circuit to which the session is bound.

   The Attribute Value field for this AVP has the following format:

      0                   1
      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
     |         Reserved          |N|A|
     +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

     (A)   0x0001    Local Attachment Circuit is up/active/ready
     (N)   0x0002    Notification is for a new circuit.


   Where, the A (Active) bit indicates whether the circuit is up/active/
   ready (1) or down/inactive/not-ready (0).

   The N (New) bit is provided to emulate (Frame Relay) NNI signalling
   between PEs.  It MAY be used to convey that a circuit has been

   reprovisioned or newly provisioned at the PE.  It is uncertain as to
   what use the receiving PE can make of this bit, although it MAY
   include logging.  It is proposed to deprecate this bit as it is of
   little or no use, hence this bit SHOULD be ignored on receipt and is
   OPTIONAL to send.  For reference, see section 3.4 of [RFC4591] which
   does not specify any additional usage beyond the setting of in the
   ICRQ, ICRP and clearing in all other control messages.

   The proposal is to extend this bitmap of values to allow for finer
   granularity of status reporting.

   The new values are:

     0                   1
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |     Reserved    |S|E|I|T|R|0|A|
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+


    Bit  Bit-Value  Name
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    (A)   0x0001    Active: Pseudowire has no faults
    (R)   0x0004    Local Attachment Circuit (ingress) Receive Fault
    (T)   0x0008    Local Attachment Circuit (egress) Transmit Fault
    (I)   0x0010    Local PSN-facing PW (ingress) Receive Fault
    (E)   0x0020    Local PSN-facing PW (egress) Transmit Fault
    (S)   0x0040    Pseudowire is in standby mode

   Where the new bits values have the following meanings:

             +----------------------+         +----------------------+

      A fault has occurred in the transmit direction between the local
      endpoint and the remote L2TP endpoint.

      Note that a fault at the session level would not necessarily
      trigger a L2TP control channel timeout.  The means of detecting
      this fault are outside the scope of this document; as an example,
      detection may be via BFD.

   (S), Pseudowire is in standby mode

             |             L2TPv3   |         |   L2TPv3             |
           Tx| Circuit   Pseudowire |Ingress  | Pseudowire   Circuit |
       <-----|                      |<--X-----|                      |
             +----------------------+   |     +----------------------+
                                        |

                                      Standby

      The pseudowire has been placed into a standby mode which means
      that although it can be signalled and is operational, it is NOT
      switching traffic.  Any received traffic SHOULD be dropped.
      Traffic MUST NOT be transmitted.


3.  Clarifications

   The following are clarifications regarding the usage of these new
   bits:

   (*) If multiple faults occur, they MUST be bitwise-OR-d together.

   (*) The (A) bit MUST NOT be set until all fault flags are cleared.
   This behavior allows an endpoint to be backwards compatible with a
   remote endpoint that does not understand these new status bits.

   (*) [RFC3931] defined the (A) bit as pertaining to local access
   circuit state only.  This draft redefines it as meaning that "no
   faults are present on the local pseudowire endpoint."

   (*) If any of the (R), (T), (I) or (E) bits are set, then the (A) bit

Internet-Draft    L2TPv3 Extended Circuit Status Values         Jan 2008


   MUST be cleared.  That is, (R, T, I, E) are a more granular
   definition of (A), such that OR-ing the bits provides an inverted
   (A).

   (*) If (A) is clear and (R, T, I, E) are clear, it means that there
   is no extended circuit status.

   (*) The (S) bit can be set in conjunction with any other bit,
   including (A). i.e. an access circuit may be experiencing a fault or
   be active and also be in standby.

   (*) Leaving standby mode is indicated by the clearing of the (S) bit.

   (*) The (N) bit has been deprecated.


4.  Security Considerations

   No additional security considerations exist with extending this
   attribute.


5.  IANA Considerations

   All values provide above are tentative prior to adoption by IANA.
