                    Asynchronous Management Protocol
                        draft-birrane-dtn-amp-00

Abstract

   This document describes an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP)
   conformant with an Asynchronous Management Architecture (AMA).  The
   AMP provides monitoring and configuration services between managing
   devices (Managers) and managed devices (Agents), some of which may
   operate on the far side of high-delay or high-disruption links.  The
   AMP minimizes the number of transmitted bytes, operates without
   sessions or (concurrent) two-way links, and functions autonomously
   when there is no timely contact with a network operator.  The AMP
   accomplishes this without requiring mobile code and generally reduces
   the processor, memory, and storage requirements of implementing
   Managers and Agents.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an Asynchronous Management Protocol (AMP)
   that provides application-layer network management services over
   links where propagation delays or link disruptions prevent timely
   communications between a network operator and a managed device.  The
   AMP is conformant to the Asynchronous Management Architecture [AMA].

1.1.  Overview

   Network management protocols define the messages that implement
   management functions amongst managed and managing devices in a
   network.  These functions include the definition, production, and
   reporting of performance data, the application of administrative

   policy, and the configuration of behavior based on local time and
   state measurements.

   Networks whose communication links are frequently challenged by
   physical or administrative effects may not provide the guarantee of
   low-latency, duplex data communications necessary to support sessions
   and other synchronous communication.  For such networks, an
   asynchronous management protocol is required which provides familiar
   network management services in the absence of sessions and operator-
   in-the-loop control.

   AMP accomplishes the network management function using open-loop,
   intelligent-push, asynchronous mechanisms that better scale as link
   challenges scale.  The protocol is designed to support several
   desirable properties outlined in [AMA] and briefly listed below.

   o  Intelligent Push of Information - The intelligent push of
      information eliminates the need for round-trip data exchange.
      This is a necessary consequence of operating in an open-loop
      system.  AMP is designed to operate even in networks of solely
      uni-directional links.

   o  Small Message Sizes - Smaller messages require smaller periods of
      viable transmission for communication, incur less re-transmission
      cost, and consume less resources when persistently stored en-route
      in the network.  AMP minimizes the size of a message whenever
      practical, to include packing and unpacking binary data, variable-
      length fields, and pre-configured data definitions.

   o  Fine-grained, Flexible Data Identification - Fine-grained
      identification allows data in the system to be explicitly
      addressed while flexible data identification allows users to
      define their own customized, addressed data collections.  In both
      cases, the ability to define precisely the data required removes
      the need to query and transmit large data sets only to filter/
      downselect desired data at a receiving device.

   o  Stateless Operation - AMP does not rely on session establishment
      or round-trip data exchange to perform network management
      functions.  Wherever possible, the AMP is designed to be
      stateless.  Where state is required, the AMP provides mechanisms
      to support transactions and graceful degradation when nodes in the
      network fail to synchronize on common definitions.

   o  Compatibility with Low-Latency Network Management Protocols - AMP
      adopts an identifier approach compatible with the Managed
      Information Base (MIB) format used by Internet management
      protocols such as the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP),

      thus enabling management interfaces between challenged networks
      and unchallenged networks (such as the Internet).

1.2.  Technical Notes

   o  Multi-byte values presented in this specification are to be
      transmitted in network-byte order.

   o  Bit-fields in this document are specified in Little-Endian format
      with bit position 0 holding the least-significant bit (LSB).  When
      illustrated in this document, the LSB appears on the right.

   o  Illustrations of byte fields in this specification consist of the
      name of the field, the type of the fields between []'s, and if the
      field is optional, the text "(opt)".  An example is shown in
      Figure 1 below.  In this illustration two fields (Field 1 and
      Field 2) are shown, with Field 1 of Type 1 and Field 2 of Type 2.
      Field 2 is also listed as being optional.  Byte fields are shown
      in order of receipt, from left-to-right.  Therefore, when
      transmitted on the wire, Field 1 will appear first, followed by
      Field 2 (if present).

                          +----------+----------+
                          | Field 1  | Field 2  |
                          | [TYPE 1] | [TYPE 2] |
                          |          |  (opt)   |

1.3.  Scope

1.3.1.  Protocol Scope

   The AMP provides data monitoring, administration, and configuration
   for applications operating above the data link layer of the OSI
   networking model.  While the AMP may be configured to support the
   management of network layer protocols, it also uses these protocol
   stacks to encapsulate and communicate its own messages.

   It is assumed that the protocols used to carry AMP messages provide
   addressing, confidentiality, integrity, security, fragmentation
   support and other network/session layer functions.  Therefore, these
   items are not discussed in the scope of this document.

1.3.2.  Specification Scope

   This document describes the format of the AMP messages exchanged
   amongst managing and managed devices in a challenged network.  This
   document further describes the rationale behind key design decisions
   to the extent that such a description informs the operational
   deployment and configuration of an AMP implementation.  This document
   does not address specific data configurations of AMP-enabled devices,
   nor does it discuss the interface between AMP and other management
   protocols, such as SNMP.

1.4.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Terminology

   Note: The terms "Actor", "Agent", "Application Data Model", "Atomic
   Data", "Computed Data", "Controls", "Macros", "Managers", and
   "Reports" are exactly conformant with those definitions as provided
   in [AMA].  Brief versions of these definitions are provided in this
   document as an aid to the reader, but the AMA specification should be
   read for a complete understanding of these concepts.

   This section identifies those terms critical to understanding the
   proper operation of the AMP.  Whenever possible, these terms align in
   both word selection and meaning with their analogs from other
   management protocols and with the AMA.

   o  Actor - A software service running on either managed or managing
      devices implementing an end-point in the AMP.  Actors may
      implement the "Manager" role, "Agent" role, or both.

   o  Agent Role - A role within the AMP, associated with a managed
      device.

   o  Application Data Model (ADM) - The set of predefined data
      definitions, reports, literals, operations, and controls given to
      an AMP actor to manage a particular application or protocol.  AMP
      actors support multiple ADMs, one for each application/protocol
      being managed.

   o  Atomic Data - Globally unique, managed data definitions whose
      definition does not change based on the configuration of an AMP
      Actor.

Internet-Draft                     AMP                       August 2015


   o  Computed Data - Data computed dynamically by an AMP Actor.

   o  Controls - Operations that may be undertaken by an AMP Actor to
      change the behavior, configuration, or state of a protocol or
      application managed by the AMP.

   o  Macros - A named, ordered collection of controls.

   o  Managed Item Definition (MID) - A parameterized structure used to
      uniquely identify all data and control definitions within the AMP.
      MIDs are a super-set of Object Identifiers (OIDs) and the
      mechanism by which the AMP maintains data compatibility with other
      management protocols.

   o  Manager - A role within the AMP associated with a managing device.
      AMP managers also provide gateways to non-AMP management protocols
      as part of conditioning the data returned from agents.  Managers
      interact with one or more agents located on the same device and/or
      on remote devices in the network.

   o  Report - A named, ordered collection of data items gathered by one
      or more AMP Agents and provided to one or more AMP Managers.
      Reports may contain atomic data, computed data, and other reports.
      Individual data within a report are not named; the report itself
      is named to reduce the size of the report message.

3.  Data Model

   This section identifies the data types used to capture information
   within the AMP.  The data model consists of the description of basic
   type definitions, compound type definitions, naming schemes, and type
   enumerations.

3.1.  Basic Types

   Basic types are those that are not comprised of any other set of
   types known to the AMP.

3.1.1.  Standard Numeric Types

   The AMP supports types for unsigned bytes, 32/64-bit signed and
   unsigned integers, and 32/64-bit floating point values, as outlined
   in Table 1.

                      Table 1: Standard Numeric Types

3.1.2.  Self-Delimiting Numeric Value (SDNV)

   The data type "SDNV" refers to a Self-Delimiting Numerical Value
   (SDNV) described in [RFC6256].  SDNVs are used in the AMP to capture
   any data items that are expected to be 8 bytes or less in total
   length.  AMP Actors MAY reject any value encoded in an SDNV that is
   greater than 8 bytes in length.

   One popular use of ADNVs in the AMP is to compress the representation
   of 32/64-bit integer values.  This simplifies the AMP by not having
   to additionally support 8/16-bit versions of integers without
   incurring significant transmission waste when encoding small numbers
   into 32/64-bit representations.

3.1.3.  Timestamp (TS)

   Timestamps represent time within the AMP.  For compatibility with a
   variety of protocols, the use of UTC time is selected to represent
   all time values in the AMP.  However, timestamps in AMP may represent
   either absolute or relative time based on the associated AMP Epoch.

   AMP uses September 9th, 2012 as the timestamp epoch (UTC time
   1348025776).  Times less than this value MUST be considered as
   relative times.  Values greater than or equal to this epoch MUST be
   considered as absolute times.  In all cases, the AMP timestamp is
   encoded as an SDNV to avoid the 32-bit 2038 UTC rollover problem.

   The absolute time associated with a timestamp can be calculated by an
   AMP Actor with the following pseudocode.

           IF (timestamp < 1348025776) THEN
              absolute_time = current_time + timestamp
           ELSE
              absolute_time = timestamp

3.2.  Compound Types

3.2.1.  String (STR)

   The AMP supports the string type as an ordered collection of byte
   values assumed terminated by a special NULL-terminator value of 0.
   Within the AMP, the String type is almost always deprecated in favor
   of the BLOB type (which asserts the data value first).

3.2.2.  Binary Large Object (BLOB)

   A Binary Large Object (BLOB) is an ordered collection of bytes
   prefaced by the number of bytes making up the BLOB.  The format of a
   BLOB is illustrated in Figure 2.  BLOBs are used in the AMP to
   capture variable data sets that are too large to efficiently store in
   an SDNV.

                        Binary Large Object Format

               +---------+--------+--------+     +--------+
               | # Bytes | BYTE 1 | BYTE 2 | ... | BYTE N |
               |  [SDNV] | [BYTE] | [BYTE] |     | [BYTE] |

3.2.3.  Data Collection (DC)

   Often, multiple BLOBs must be communicated in the AMP.  A Data
   Collection (DC) is an ordered set of BLOBs, prefaced by the number of
   BLOBs making up the collection.  The format of a DC is illustrated in
   Figure 3.

3.2.4.  Typed Data Collection (TDC)

   When Data Collections are used to convey parameters for AMP controls,
   or otherwise used to capture the "return" values of controls, the
   data SHOULD be annotated with the associated type for each data in
   the collection.  The Typed Data Collection (TDC) provides this
   augmentation.  A TDC is a regular DC with one additional BLOB added
   to the collection to capture type information.  This "Type BLOB"
   stores the type of each other entry in the DC in a byte.

   The TDC format is illustrated in Figure 4

                           Typed Data Collection

         +---------+-----------+-------------+     +-------------+
         | # BLOBs | TYPE BLOB | DATA BLOB 1 | ... | DATA BLOB N |

         +---------+-----------+-------------+     +-------------+

                  Figure 4: Typed Data Collection Format

   For example, consider a Data Collection of 3 BLOBs, with BLOB 1
   having type UINT, BLOB 2 having type VAST, and BLOB 3 having type
   SDNV.  The DC structure has no way of capturing this type
   information.  The corresponding TDC would have 4 BLOBs.  BLOB 1 would
   have length 3 and contain the enumerations for UINT, VAST, and SDNV -
   each encoded in one byte.  BLOBs 2, 3, and 4 would be the original
   data.  This example is illustrated in Figure 5.

3.3.  Naming Structures

   Application, protocol, and user data defined and exchanged within the
   AMP must be uniquely identifiable both within a network and (when AMP
   is used in an overlay) across networks.  This section describes the
   "Managed Identifier" (MID) which is the single data structure used to
   provide unique naming for all AMP data structures.  The MID is a
   variable-length structure that encapsulates all of the information
   and annotation necessary to identify an AMP structure.

   The MID consists of a "core" unique identifier and several useful
   annotations to assist with filtering, access control, and
   parameterization.  The unique identifier at the core of a MID is
   based on the Object Identifier (OID) and its Basic Encoding Rules
   (BER) as identified in the ITU-T X.690 standard.  The specifics of
   the OID encoding are provided below.

   The AMP uses the OID as its fundamental unit of identification to
   allow its Agents and Managers to more easily interface with other
   management schemes (such as SNMP) at management boundaries between
   challenged and un-challenged networks.

   The MID structure is comprised of up to four fields, as illustrated
   in Figure 6.

   The MID fields are defined as follows.

   Flags
           Flags are used to describe the type of component identified
           by the MID, identify which optional fields in the MID are
           present, and the encoding used to capture the component's
           OID.  The layout of the flag byte is illustrated in Figure 7.

           MID Type (TYPE)
                   The type of the component encapsulated by the MID,
                   enumerated as data (0), control (1), literal (2), or
                   operator (3).

           MID Category (CAT)
                   The category of the component encapsulated by the
                   MID, enumerated as atomic (0), computed (1), and
                   collection (2).

           Issuer Present (ISS)
                   Whether the issuer field is present (1) or not (0)
                   for this MID.  If this flag has a value of 1 then the
                   issuer field MUST be present in the MID.  Otherwise,
                   the issuer field MUST NOT be present in the MID.

           Tag Present (TAG)
                   Whether the tag field is present (1) or not (0) for
                   this MID.  If this flag has a value of 1 then the tag

                   field MUST be present in the MID.  Otherwise, the tag
                   field MUST NOT be present.

           OID Type (OID)
                   Whether the contained OID field represents an full
                   OID (0), a parameterized OID (1), a compressed full
                   OID (2), or a compressed, parameterized OID (3).  OID
                   types are described below.

           For example, a MID flag byte of 0x00 indicates an atomic data
           value with no issuer or tag field encapsulating a full OID.
           A MID flag byte of 0x94 indicates a computed data value with
           an issuer field, but no tag field encapsulating a compressed
           OID.

   Issuer
           This is a binary identifier representing a predetermined
           issuer name.  The AMP protocol does not parse or validate
           this identifier, using it only as a distinguishing bit
           pattern to assure MID uniqueness.  This value, for example,
           may come from a global registry of organizations, an issuing
           node address, or some other network-unique marking.

   OID
           The core of a MID is its encapsulated OID.  Aside from the
           flag byte, this is the only other mandatory element within a
           MID.  The AMP defines four types of OID references: Full
           OIDs, Parameterized OIDs, Compressed Full OIDs, and
           Compressed Parameterized OIDs.

           Full OID
                   This is a binary representation of the full OID
                   associated with the named value.  The OID is encoded
                   using a modified form of the ASN.1 Basic Encoding
                   Rules (BER) for Object Identifiers (type value of
                   0x06).  In the standard ASN.1 encoding, four octet
                   sets are defined: identifier octets, length octets,
                   contents octets, and end-of-contents octets.  An AMP
                   Full OID does not use the identifier, length, or end-
                   of-contents octets.  Instead, an AMP Full OID is
                   comprised of two fields: the length in bytes of the
                   encoded OID captured in an SDNV followed by the OID
                   contents octets.  It should be noted that this
                   effectively encodes the "OID" as a Data Collection.
                   The Full OID format is illustrated in Figure 8.

   that represent a postfix notation stack of Data, Literal, and
   Operation types.  For example, the infix expression A * (B * C) is
   represented as the sequence A B C * *. The format of an expression is
   illustrated in Figure 13.

   Expression
           An expression is represented in the AMP as a MID collection,
           where each MID in the ordered collection represents the data,
           literals, and operations that comprise the expression.

3.4.3.  Predicate (PRED)

   Predicates are expressions whose values are interpreted as a Boolean.
   The value of zero MUST be considered "false" and all other values
   MUST be considered "true".  Similar to an expression, a predicate is
   represented as a MID collection (MC).

3.4.4.  Definition (DEF)

   Several data structured within the AMP are defined as a named
   collection of other named entities.  For example, a Macro is a named
   collection of Controls; a Report is a named collection of other data
   items; a computed data definition is a named expression which, from

   above, is a collection of MIDs representing the postfix notation of
   the calculating function.

   The Definition (DEF) type captures instances where the AMP refers to
   a named, typed collection of information.  The format of a DEF is
   illustrated in Figure 14.

4.  AMP Structures

   This section identifies the basic structures that comprise the data
   items exchanged in the AMP, including the definition of these
   structures based on the aforementioned data model and the behavior of
   AMP Actors when interacting with these structures.

4.1.  AMA Overview

   The AMA defines a series of logical components that should be
   included as part of an asynchronous management protocol.  These
   components are summarized from the AMA in the following table.

                          AMP Logical Components

   The AMP implements these logical components in largely a one-to-one
   fashion with the exception that the AMP defines two types of
   autonomous rules: time-based and state-based.  This section describes
   the format of these data structures in the context of the
   aforementioned AMP data types.  NOTE: The expression of these
   structures is only to describe how these structures appear in
   messages exchanged between and amongst Agents and Managers in a
   challenged network.  Individual software applications may choose
   their own most efficient internal representation of these structures.

4.2.  Primitive Data

   Primitive Data are pre-defined as part of ADMs for various
   applications and protocols.  These represent values that are directly
   measured by firmware on Agents rather than computed as a function of
   other data in the system.

4.2.1.  Definition

   The representation of these data is simply their identifying MIDs.
   The representation of a primitive data item is illustrated in
   Figure 15.

                                 +-------+
                                 |  ID   |

                     Figure 15: Primitive Data Format

   ID
           This is the MID identifying the primitive data.  Since
           primitive data are always defined solely in the context of an
           ADM, this MID MUST NOT have either an ISSUER field or a TAG
           field.  This ID MUST NOT encapsulate a parameterized OID.
           The low nibble of the MID flag byte for primitive data is
           always 0x0.

4.2.2.  Processing

   Managers

   o  Store the MID for each known Primitive Data definition.

   o  Associate a data type to each known Primitive Data definition.

   o  Encode Primitive Data MIDs in Controls to Agents, as appropriate.

   Agents

   o  Store the MID for each known Primitive Data definition.

   o  Associate a data type to each known Primitive Data definition.

   o  Calculate the value of a Primitive Data definition when required,
      such as when generating a Report or evaluating an Expression.

4.3.  Computed Data

   Computed data are either as defined in an ADM or tactically by
   operators in a particular network.  Computed data differ from
   Primitive Data in that they are completely described by other known
   data in the system (either other Computed Data, or other Primitive
   Data).  For example, letting P# be a Primitive Data item and C# be a

   Computed Data item, the following are examples of Computed Data
   definitions.

   C1 = P1 * P2

   C2 = C1 + P3

4.3.1.  Definition

   Computed data are defined by the triplet (TYPE, ID, EXPR) as
   illustrated in Figure 16.  Note that this format is identical to the
   DEFINITION data type.  As such, a computed data definition is
   captured in a DEF.

                           +---------------+

   ID
           This is the MID identifying the computed data.  When a
           computed data item is defined in an ADM this MID MUST NOT
           have either an ISSUER field or a TAG field.  When the
           computed data is defined outside of an ADM, the MID MUST have
           an ISSUE field and, optionally, a TAG field.  This ID MUST
           NOT encapsulate a parameterized OID.  The low nibble of the
           MID flag byte for computed data is always 0x4.

   TYPE
           This is the resultant type of the computed data, and acts as
           a static cast for the result of the expression.  Note, it is
           possible to specify a type different then the resultant type
           of an expression.  For example, if an expression adds two
           single-precision floating point numbers, the computed data
           may have an integer type associated with it.  This byte is
           populated with the enumeration of the associated type and
           MUST be defined as one of the numeric data types, as outlined
           in Section 5.

   Definition
           The computed data value is computed by an expression.
           Notably, an EXPR is simply a MC with the restriction that the
           MIDs represent a series of primitive data, computed data,
           literals, and operations that form a postfix expression.

4.3.2.  Processing

   Managers

   o  Store the MID for each ADM-defined Computed Data definition.

   o  Send requests to Agents to add, list, describe, and remove custom
      Computed Data definitions.

   o  Remember custom Computed Data definitions.

   o  Encode Computed Data MIDs in Controls to Agents, as appropriate.

   Agents

   o  Store the MID for each ADM-defined Computed Data definition.

   o  Calculate the value of Computed Data when required, such as during
      rule evaluation, calculating other Computed Data values, and
      generating Reports.

   o  Add, Remove, List, and Describe custom Computed Data definitions.

4.4.  Report

   Reports capture information generated by Agents and transmitted to
   Managers in the AMP.  Since the AMP is an asynchronous protocol there
   is no explicit association between the contents of a report and a
   generating action by either a Manager or an Agent.

   Note that reports in the AMP are NOT key-value pairs.  The definition
   of the report is assumed known by the Agent producing the report and
   the Manager receiving the report.  Similarly, when a report captured
   the return of a control, the format of the return value is assumed
   known to the Agent and Manager.  This approach results in a
   significant space saving when communicating reports in the network.

4.4.1.  Definition

   A report is a named, typed data collection.  Each BLOB within the
   typed data collection is referred to as a report entry.  Reports are
   generated in one of three scenarios: (1) when a report is explicitly

   requested, (2) when a rule determines that a report should be
   generated, and (3) when a control runs and generates a return value
   that is sent as a report.

   When a report is generated by command or by rule, then the report is
   given a unique identifier either by the ADM defining the report, or
   by an operator defining a report as part of network configuration.
   When a report is generated ad-hoc to capture the return value of a
   control, the report identifier is the same as the identifier of the
   control whose return value it captures.

   The definition of a report is illustrated in Figure 17.

           TAG field.  This ID MUST NOT encapsulate a parameterized OID.

   o  Add, Remove, List, and Describe custom Report definitions.

   o  Agents SHOULD collect multiple Report entries into a single Report
      for transmission to a Manager rather than sending multiple,
      individual Reports to a Manager.

4.5.  Control

   A Control represents a pre-defined (possibly parameterized) opcode
   that can be run on an Agent.  Controls in the AMP are always defined
   in the context of an ADM.  There is no concept of an operator-defined
   control, as controls represent the opcodes of actions taken directly
   by the firmware.  Since Controls are pre-configured in Agents and
   Managers as part of ADM support, their representation is simply the
   MID that identifies them, similar to Primitive Data.

   One difference between the definition of Controls and Primitive Data
   is that Controls may accept parameters.  This is accomplished by
   using a parameterized OID in the MID identifying the Control.

4.5.1.  Definition

   The format of a Control is illustrated in Figure 18.

                                 +-------+

           This is the MID identifying the Control.  Since Controls are
           always defined solely in the context of an ADM, this MID MUST
           NOT have either an ISSUER field or a TAG field.  The low
           nibble of the MID flag byte for Controls is always 0x1.

4.5.2.  Processing

   o  Store the number of parameters and each parameter type for

   Agents

   o  Store the MID for each ADM-defined Control definition.

      parameters when necessary in the context of control messages and

   o  Communicate "return" values from Controls back to Managers in a
      report where such return values are defined for a Control.

4.6.  Time-Based Rule (TRL)

   A Time-Based Rule (TRL) specifies that a particular action should be
   taken by an Agent based on some time interval.  A TRL specifies that
   starting at a particular START time, and for every PERIOD seconds
   thereafter, an ACTION should be run by the Agent until the ACTION has
   been run for COUNT times.  When the TRL is no longer valid it MAY BE
   discarded by the Agent.

   Examples of TRLs include:

      Starting 2 hours from receipt, produce Report R1 every 10 hours
      ending after 20 times.

      Starting at the given absolute time, run Macro M1 every 24 hours
      ending after 365 times.

           an ADM, the MID MUST have an ISSUE field and, optionally, a
           TAG field.  This ID MUST NOT encapsulate a parameterized OID.
           The low nibble of the MID flag byte for computed data is
           always 0x5.

   START
           The time at which the TRL should start to be evaluated.  This
           will mark the first running of the action associated with the
           TRL.

   PERIOD
           The number of seconds to wait between running the action
           associated with the TRL.

   COUNT
           The number of times the TRL action will be run.  The special
           value of 0 indicates the TRL should continue running the
           action indefinitely.

   ACTION
           The Macro representing the collection of controls to run as
           part of the action.  This is captured as a MC data type with

4.7.  State-Based Rule (SRL)

   A State-Based Rule (SRL) specifies that a particular action should be
   taken by an Agent based on some evaluation of the internal state of
   the Agent.  A SRL specifies that starting at a particular START time,
   and for every PERIOD seconds thereafter, an ACTION should be run by
   the Agent if some CONDITION evaluates to true, until the CONDITION
   has been evaluated COUNT times.  When the SRL is no longer valid it
   MAY BE discarded by the Agent.

   Examples of SRLs include:

      Starting 2 hours from receipt, whenever Computed Data C1 > 10,
      produce Report R1 no more than 20 times.

      Starting at the given absolute time, whenever C2 + (P1 * C3) !=
      C4, run Macro M1 no more than 36 times.

4.7.1.  Definition

   The format of a SRL is illustrated in Figure 20.

           This is the MID identifying the SRL.  When a report is
           defined in an ADM this MID MUST NOT have either an ISSUER
           field or a TAG field.  When the report is defined outside of
           an ADM, the MID MUST have an ISSUE field and, optionally, a
           TAG field.  This ID MUST NOT encapsulate a parameterized OID.

           The low nibble of the MID flag byte for computed data is
           always 0x5.

   START
           The time at which the SRL condition should start to be
           evaluated.  This will mark the first evaluation of the
           condition associated with the SRL.

   CONDITION
           The predicate capturing the internal Agent state evaluation
           which, if true, results in the SRL running the associated
           action.  The predicate is an EXPR which evaluates to "false"
           if the expression result is 0 and evaluates to "true" in any
           other case.  An expression, itself, is simply a MC
           representing a series of Primitive Data, Computed Data,
           Literal, and/or Operator MIDs that are ordered to create a
           valid postfix expression.

   COUNT
           The number of times the SRL condition will be run.  The
           special value of 0 indicates the SRL should continue
           evaluating the condition indefinitely.

   ACTION
           The Macro representing the collection of controls to run as
           part of the action.  This is captured as a MC data type with
           the constraint that every MID within the MC represent a
           control or another Macro.

4.8.  Macro

   Macros in the AMP are simply ordered collections of MIDs (an MC) that
   describe Controls or other Macros.  When run by an Agent, each MID in
   the MC is run in order.  Similar to a Computed Data definition, a
   Macro is a named collection of MIDs and is represented by a DEF
   structure.

   While the MIDs representing any given control may be parameterized,
   the MID associated with a Macro MAY NOT be parameterized.

4.8.1.  Definition

   The format of a Macro is illustrated in Figure 21.

                               +-------+

   ID
           This is the MID identifying the Macro.  When a Macro item is
           defined in an ADM this MID MUST NOT have either an ISSUER
           field or a TAG field.  When the computed data is defined
           outside of an ADM, the MID MUST have an ISSUE field and,
           optionally, a TAG field.  This ID MUST NOT encapsulate a
           parameterized OID.  The low nibble of the MID flag byte for
           Macro is always 0x9.

   TYPE
           The data type for a Macro is always the special type for
           Macro as defined in Section 5.  Macros do not have a specific
           return type otherwise.

   Definition
           This is the ordered collection of MIDs that identify the
           Controls and other Macros that should be run as part of
           running this Macro.

   o  Add, Remove, List, and Describe custom Macro definitions.

4.9.  Literal

   Literals in the AMP represent constants either as defined in an ADM
   or as specified by a user.  Examples of constants that could be
   defined in an ADM include common mathematical values such as PI or
   well-known Epochs such as the UNIX Epoch.  Examples of constants that
   could be user-defined as part of expressions include simple numerical
   values, such as 5 in the expression (A > 5).  In both cases, Literals
   MUST ALWAYS be defined in an ADM, with user-definable Literal values
   being provided through the MID parameterization mechanism as follows.

   The ADM definition of a Literal MUST include the type of the Literal
   value.  Since ADM definitions are preconfigured on Agents and
   Managers in an AMA the type information for a given Literal is
   therefore known by all Actors in the system.

   If the MID identifying the Literal encapsulates a non-parameterized
   OID, then the value is given in the ADM and Agents and Managers can
   lookup this value in their set of pre-configured data.

   If the MID identifying the Literal encapsulates a parameterized OID,
   then the parameters to the OID define the value of the Literal.
   Users wishing to create a new Literal will create a MID with whatever
   parameters are necessary to create the value.  The documentation of
   the ADM defining the Literal MUST describe how parameters result in
   the calculation of the Literal value.

   ID
           This is the MID identifying the Literal.  When a Literal item
           is defined in an ADM this MID MUST NOT have either an ISSUER
           field or a TAG field.  When the Literal is defined outside of
           an ADM, the MID MUST have an ISSUE field and, optionally, a
           TAG field.  This ID MUST NOT encapsulate a parameterized OID.
           The low nibble of the MID flag byte for a literal is always
           0x2.

   Managers

   o  Store the MID for each ADM-defined Literal definition.

   o  Encode Literal MIDs in Controls to Agents, as appropriate.

   Agents

      generating a Report or when evaluating an Expression.

4.10.  Operator

   Operators in the AMP are always defined in the context of an ADM.
   There is no concept of a user-defined operator, as operators
   represent mathematical functions implemented by the firmware on an
   Agent.  Since Operators are pre-configured in Agents and Managers as
   part of ADM support, their representation is simply the MID that
   identifies them, similar to Primitive Data and Controls.

   The ADM definition of an Operator MUST specify how many parameters
   are expected.  For example, the unary NOT Operator ("!") would accept
   one parameter.  The binary PLUS Operator ("+") would accept two

   parameters.  A custom function to calculate the average of the last
   10 samples of a data item would accept 10 parameters.

4.10.1.  Definition

   Operators are always evaluated in the context of an Expression.  The
   format of an Operator is illustrated in Figure 23.

   ID
           This is the MID identifying the Operator.  Since Operators
           are always defined solely in the context of an ADM, this MID
           MUST NOT have either an ISSUER field or a TAG field.  The low
           nibble of the MID flag byte for Operators is always 0x3.

5.  Data Type IDs and Enumerations

   This section lists the data type IDs and enumerations for the data
   types outlined in this section.  IDs are the text abbreviations used
   in this specification and in ADMs to identify data types.
   Enumerations associate data types with an unsigned integer value.
   These enumerations MUST be used whenever a data type is represented
   as a numerical representation, such as the case with the TYPE BLOB of
   a TDC.

                    AMP Data Type IDs and Enumerations

6.  Application Data Model Template

6.1.  Overview

   An application data model (ADM) specifies the set of AMP components
   associated with a particular application/protocol.  The purpose of
   the ADM is to provide a guaranteed interface for the management of an
   application or protocol over AMP that is independent of the nuances
   of its software implementation.  In this respect, the ADM is
   conceptually similar to the Managed Information Base (MIB) used by
   SNMP, but contains additional information relating to command opcodes
   and more expressive syntax for automated behavior.

   Currently, the ADM is an organizing document and not used to
   automatically generate software.  As such, the ADM template lists the
   kind of information that must be present in an ADM definition but
   does not address mechanisms for automating implementations.

   Each ADM specifies the globally unique identifiers and descriptions
   for all data, controls, literals, and operators associated with the
   application or protocol managed by the ADM.  Any implementation
   claiming compliance with a given ADM must compute all identified
   data, perform identified controls, and understand identified literals
   and operators.

6.2.  Template

   ADM definitions specify the metadata, data, controls, literals, and
   operators associated with a managed application or protocol.

6.2.1.  ADM Metadata

   ADM metadata consist of the items necessary to uniquely identify the
   ADM itself.  The required metadata items include the following.

6.2.2.  ADM Information Capture

   The ADM Data Section consist of all components in the "data" category
   associated with the managed application or protocol.  The information
   that must be provided for each of these items is as follows.

   Name
      Every component in an ADM MUST be given a human-readable,
      consistent name that uniquely identifies the component in the
      context of the application or protocol.  These names will be used
      by human-computer interfaces for manipulating components.

   MID
      The managed identifier that describes this data item.  MIDs in
      components identified by an ADM MUST NOT contain an issuer or a
      tag value.  In cases where a partial OID is specified, the ADM OID
      prefix is presumed as the base.  In cases where the OID is
      parameterized, the parameter values are not included in the MID
      definition in the ADM as parameters are provided at runtime by
      implementations.

   OID
      A human-readable version of the OID encapsulated in the MID for
      the component (e.g., 1.2.3.4).  When a nickname is used to
      represent an compressed OID, the nickname enumeration is included
      in this field enclosed by square brackets.  For example, if OID
      nickname 0 refers to the OID prefix 1.2.3.4.5, then the OID
      1.2.3.4.5.6 may be listed more compactly as [0].6

      Every component in an ADM MUST be given a human-readable,
      consistent description that provides a potential user with a
      compact, effective summary of the component.

   Type
      For components that evaluate to a data value, the data type for
      that value must be represented.

   # Parameters
      For components with a parameterized OID, the ADM MUST provide the
      expected number of parameters.  A value of 0 indicates that the
      OID has no parameters and MUST NOT be used for any MID which has a
      parameterized OID.  When omitted, the number of parameters is
      considered 0.

   Parameter N Name
      Each parameter of a parameterized component must be given a name.

   Parameter N Description
      Each parameter of a parameterized component must be given a
      summary that describes how the parameter will be used by the
      application or protocol.

   Parameter N Type
      Each parameter of a parameterized component must be given a type
      that describes the structure capturing the parameter value.
      Notably, while parameters in the OID form something similar to a
      function prototype, there is no sense of function call or stack
      and therefore all parameters should be considered as pass-by-
      value.

7.  The Agent ADM

   The full set of Primitive Data, Computed Data, Reports, Controls,
   Rules, Macros, Literals, and Operators that can be understood by an
   AMP Agent have been separated into an AMP Agent ADM.  Just as the AMP
   uses ADMs to manage applications and protocols, the ADM model is also
   used to implement the functionality of the Agent.  As such, the AMP
   message specification is limited to three basic communications:

      - Adding an Agent to the list of managed devices known to a
      Manager.

      - Sending a Macro of one or more Controls to an Agent.

      - Receiving a Report of one or more Report Entries from an Agent.

   as outlined in Section 8.

Internet-Draft                     AMP                       August 2015


   The entire management of a network can be performed using these three
   messages and the configurations from associated ADMs.

8.  Functional Specification

   This section describes the format of the messages that comprise the
   AMP protocol.  When discussing the format/types of data that comprise
   message fields, the following conventions are used.

8.1.  Message Group Format

   Individual messages within the AMP are combined into a single group
   for communication with another AMP Actor.  Messages within a group
   MUST be received and applied as an atomic unit.  The format of a
   message group is illustrated in Figure 24.  These message groups are
   assumed communicated amongst Agents and Managers as the payloads of
   encapsulating protocols which MAY provide additional security and
   data integrity features.

           +--------+-----------+-----------+     +-----------+
           | # Msgs | Timestamp | Message 1 | ... | Message N |
           | [SDNV] |    [TS]   |   [VAR]   |     |   [VAR]   |
           +--------+-----------+-----------+     +-----------+

                    Figure 24: AMP Message Group Format

   # Msgs
           The number of messages that are together in this message
           group.

   Timestamp
           The creation time for this messaging group.  This timestamp
           MUST be an absolute time.  Individual messages may have their
           own creation timestamps based on their type, but the group
           timestamp also serves as the default creation timestamp for
           every message in the group.

   Message N
           The Nth message in the group.

8.2.  Message Format

   Each message identified in the AMP specification adheres to a common
   message format, illustrated in Figure 25, consisting of a message
   header, a message body, and an optional trailer.

   Header
           The message header byte is shown in Figure 26.  The header
           identifies a message context and opcode as well as flags that
           control whether a report should be generated on message
           success (Ack) and whether a report should be generated on
           message failure (Nack).

           Opcode
                   The opcode field identifies the opcode of the
                   message, within the associated message context.

           ACK Flag
                   The ACK flag describes whether successful application
                   of the message must generate an acknowledgement back
                   to the message sender.  If this flag is set (1) then
                   the receiving actor MUST generate a report
                   communicating this status.  Otherwise, the actor MAY
                   generate such a report based on other criteria.

           NACK Flag
                   The NACK flag describes whether a failure applying
                   the message must generate an error notice back to the
                   message sender.  If this flag is set (1) then the
                   receiving Actor MUST generate a report communicating
                   this status.  Otherwise, the Actor MAY generate such
                   a report based on other criteria.

           ACL Used Flag
                   The ACL used flag indicates whether the message has a
                   trailer associated with it that specifies the list of
                   AMP actors that may participate in the Actions or

                   definitions associated with the message.  This area
                   is still under development.

   Body
           The message body contains the information associated with the
           given message.

   Trailer
           An OPTIONAL access control list (ACL) may be appended as a
           trailer to a message.  When present, the ACL for a message
           identifiers the agents and managers that can be affected by
           the definitions and actions contained within the message.
           The explicit impact of an ACL is described in the context of
           each message below.  When an ACL trailer is not present, the
           message results may be visible to any AMP Actor in the
           network, pursuant to other security protocol implementations.

8.3.  Register Agent (0x00)

   The Register Agent message is used to inform a AMP manager of the
   presence of another agent in the network.

                               +----------+
                               | Agent ID |

                  Figure 27: Register Agent Message Body

   Agent ID
           The Agent ID MUST represent the unique address of the Agent
           in whatever protocol is used to communicate with the Agent.

8.4.  Data Report (0x12)

   Data reports include a listing of one or more data items collected
   from a managed device.  These reports may include atomic data,
   computed data, or any report definition known to the generating
   device.  Each message is a concatenation of ID/Data definitions with
   the overall message length assumed to be captured in the underlying
   transport container.

   Num Rpts
           The number of reports in the data report message.

   RPT N
           The Nth report.

8.5.  Perform Control (0x20)

   The perform control method causes the receiving AMP Actor to apply
   one or more pre-configured controls provided in the form of a Macro.

                           +-------+-----------+
                           | Start |  Controls |

                           +-------+-----------+

                  Figure 29: Perform Control Message Body

   Start
           The time at which the Macro should be run.

   Controls
           The collection of controls (Macro) to be run by the AMP
           Actor.  The MID identifying a control will contain the
           parameters for the control (if any) through the use of a
           parameterized OID captured within the MIDs in the MC.

9.  IANA Considerations

   At this time, this protocol has no fields registered by IANA.

10.  Security Considerations

   Security within the AMP exists in two layers: transport layer
   security and access control.

   Transport-layer security addresses the questions of authentication,
   integrity, and confidentiality associated with the transport of
   messages between and amongst Managers and Agents.  This security is
   applied before any particular Actor in the system receives data and,
   therefore, is outside of the scope of this document.

   Finer grain application security is done via ACLs provided in the AMP
   message headers.
