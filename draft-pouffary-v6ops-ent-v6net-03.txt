Internet Draft    IPv6 Enterprise Networks Scenarios         June 2003 
 
 
  1. Introduction 

   This document describes the scenarios for IPv6 deployment within 
   Enterprise networks.  It will focus upon an Enterprise set of network 
   base scenarios with assumptions, coexistence with legacy IPv4 nodes, 
   networks, and applications, and network infrastructure requirements.  
   These requirements will be used to provide analysis to determine a 
   set of Enterprise solutions in a later document.  

   The audience for this document is the enterprise network team 
   considering deployment of IPv6.  

   To frame the discussion the document will describe a set of scenarios 
   and characteristics for each scenario and then follow those sets with 
   example scenario use, and points of transition. 

   Each enterprise will need to select the transition to best suit their 
   business requirements. Any attempt to define a default or one-size-
   fits-all transition scenario will simply not work. 

   While it is difficult to quantify all the potential motivations for 
   enterprise network teams to move to IPv6, there are some cases where 
   an abstract description is possible.

  2. Terminology 

    
   Enterprise Network    - An Enterprise Network is a network that has 
                           multiple links, a router connection to a 
                           Provider, and is actively managed by a 
                           network operations entity. 

   Provider              - A Provider is an entity that provides 
                           services and connectivity to the Internet or 
                           other private external networks for the 
                           Enterprise Network. 
   IPv6/IPv4             - A node or network capable of supporting both 
                           IPv6 and IPv4. 
   IPv4 only             - A node or network capable of supporting only 
                           IPv4. 
   IPv6 only             - A node or network capable of supporting only 
                           IPv6.

  3. Network Base Scenarios 

   Three base scenarios are defined to capture the essential abstraction 
   set for the Enterprise. Each scenario has assumptions and 
   requirements. 

   These scenarios will drive the network characteristics and then 
   examples for use by this document. 


   3.1 Network Base Scenarios Defined 

    
   Scenario 1: Enterprise with an existing IPv4 network wants to deploy 
               IPv6 in parallel with their IPv4 network. 
     Assumptions:   The IPv4 characteristics have an equivalent in 
                    IPv6. 
     Requirements:  Don't break IPv4 network characteristics 
                    assumptions with IPv6. IPv6 should be equivalent or 
                    "better" than the ones in IPv4, however, it is 
                    understood that IPv6 is not required to solve every 
                    single problem. 

    
               Enterprise with an existing IPv4 network wants to deploy a set of    Scenario 2: 
               particular IPv6 "applications" (application is voluntarily loosely 
               defined here, e.g. peer to peer). The IPv6 deployment is limited to 
               the minimum required to operate this set of applications.  
                
                    IPv6 software/hardware components for the application set are      Assumptions: 
                    available. 
                     
     Requirements:  Don't break IPv4 network operations 

    
   Scenario 3: Enterprise deploying a new network or re-structuring an 
               existing network, decides IPv6 is the basis for network 
               communication. 

     Assumptions:   Required IPv6 network components are available, or 
                    available over some defined timeline. 
     Requirements:  Interoperation and Coexistence with IPv4 network 
                    operations and applications are required for 
                    communications.

   campuses. 
   - External network operation. 
   - External connectivity required. 
   - Multiple sites connected by leased lines. 
   - Provider independent IPv4 addresses. 
   - ISP does not offer IPv6 service. 

   Applications run by the enterprise: 
   - Internal Web/Mail. 
   - File servers. 
   - Java applications. 
   - Collaborative development tools. 

   Internal network operation: 
   - In house operation of the network. 
   - DHCP (v4) is used for all desktops, servers use static address 
    configuration. 
   - The DHCP server to update naming records for dynamic desktops uses 
    dynamic DNS. 
   - A web based tool is used to enter name to address mappings for 
    statically addressed servers. 
   - Network management is done using SNMP. 
   - All routers and switches are upgradeable to IPv6.

Internet Draft    IPv6 Enterprise Networks Scenarios         June 2003 
 
 
   - Existing firewalls can be upgraded to support IPv6 rules. 
   - Load balancers do not support IPv6, upgrade path unclear. 

   Example Network B: 

   A bank running a massive ATM network with some number of gazillions 
   of transactions per second against central databases external network 
   operation: 
   - External connectivity not required. 
   - Multiple sites connected by VPN. 

   Applications run by the enterprise: 
   - ATM transaction application. 
   - ATM management application. 

   Internal Network Operation: 
   - IPsec must protect all traffic. 
   - QoS policy for guaranteed delivery and urgent transactions. 
   - Network is managed through in-house developed tools. 
    

   Example Network C: 

   A Security Defense network: 
   - External network required at secure specific points. 
   - Network is its own Internet. 
   - Network must be able absorb ad-hoc creation of sub-Networks. 
   - Entire parts of the Network are completely mobile. 
   - All nodes on the network can be mobile (including routers) 
   - Networking infrastructure mostly does not exist today with IPv4. 
   - Network True High-Availability is mandatory. 
   - Network must be able to be managed from ad-hoc location. 
   - All nodes must be able to be configured from stateless mode. 

   Applications run by the Enterprise: 
   - Multimedia streaming of audio, video, and data for all nodes. 
   - Data computation and analysis on stored and create data. 
   - Transfer of data coordinate points to sensor devices. 
   - Data and Intelligence gathering applications from all nodes. 
    
   Internal Network Operations: 
   - All packets must be secured end-2-end with encryption. 
   - Intrusion Detection exists on all network entry points. 
   - Network must be able to bolt on to Internet points to share 
    bandwidth as required from Providers. 
   - VPNs can be used but NAT can never be used. 
   - Nodes must be able to access IPv4 legacy applications over IPv6 
    network.

  4. Support for Legacy IPv4 Nodes and Applications 

   The Enterprise network will have to support the coexistence of IPv6 
   and IPv4, to support legacy IPv4 applications and nodes. The 
   Enterprise user has the following choices for that coexistence to 
   consider today.  


   4.1 IPv4 Tunnels to Encapsulate IPv6 

   IPv6/IPv4 nodes want to communicate using IPv6, but an IPv4 Internal 
   router is between them. These nodes could also be Mobile nodes on a 
   visited network 


   4.2 IPv6 Tunnels to Encapsulate IPv4 

   An IPv4/IPv6 node wants to communicate with a legacy IPv4 node and is 
   on an IPv6 only link and routing domain. 


   4.3 IPv6 NAT to Communicate with IPv4 

   An IPv6/IPv4 node wants to communicate with a legacy IPv4 only node. 

   Using NAT for this point of transition will preclude end-2-end 
   security, applications, and remove some benefits from the IPv6 
   protocol.

  5. Network Infrastructure Requirements 

   The Enterprise will need to determine what network infrastructure 
   they require for their deployment of IPv6. This infrastructure will 
   need to be analyzed and understood as a critical resource to manage. 


   5.1 DNS 

   DNS will now have to support both IPv4 and IPv6 DNS records and the 
   Enterprise will need to determine how the DNS is to be managed and 
   accessed. 


   5.2 Routing 

    Interior and Exterior routing will be required to support both IPv4 
    and IPv6 routing protocols, and the coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 
    over the enterprise network.  The enterprise will need to define 
    the routing topology, and any ingress and egress points to provider 
    networks.  The enterprise will also need to define points of 
    transition mechanism to use within that routing topology. 


   5.3 Autoconfiguration 

   IPv6 introduces the concept of stateless autoconfiguration in 
   addition to statefull autoconfiguration.  The enterprise will have to 
   determine the best method of autoconfiguration, for their network. 


   5.4 Security 

   Current existing mechanisms used for IPv4 to provide security need to 
   be supported for IPv6 within the Enterprise. 


   5.5 Applications 

   Existing applications will need to be ported to support both IPv4 and 
   IPv6. 


   5.6 Network Management 

   The addition of IPv6 and points of transition will need to be managed 
   by the Enterprise network operations center.  This will affect many 
   components of the network and software required on nodes.

   5.7 Address Planning 

   The address space within the Enterprise will need to be defined and 
   coordinated with the routing topology of the Enterprise network.

6. Security Considerations 

   This document lists scenarios for the deployment of IPv6 in 
   enterprise networks, and there are no security considerations 
   associated with making such a list. 

   There will security considerations for the deployment of IPv6 in each 
   of these scenarios, but they will be addressed in the document that 
   includes the analysis of each scenario.
