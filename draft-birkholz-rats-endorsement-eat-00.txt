        A CWT Claims Set Definition for RATS Endorsement Tokens
                 draft-birkholz-rats-endorsement-eat-00

Abstract

   An Endorsement is defined by the RATS Architecture as a "secure
   statement that some entity (typically a manufacturer) vouches for the
   integrity of an Attester's signing capability".  This documents
   defines Claims to be used in CBOR Web Tokens in the same fashion
   attestation Evidence can be represented via Entity Attestation Tokens
   (EAT).  The defined Claims can be included in Endorsement Tokens.
   Endorsement Tokens can be provided by a manufacturer or a third party
   authority to vouch for the capabilities and characteristics of a
   hardware component a RATS Attester is not capable to create Evidence
   about.

1.  Introduction

   Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS) can be used to establish trust
   in the trustworthiness of a remote peer (the Attester).  As a Relying
   Party typically cannot evaluate every kind of Attester by itself, the
   RATS architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] defines the Verifier
   role, to off-load the burden of appraisal to another entity than the
   Relying Party itself.  The duty of a Verifier is to produce
   Attestation Results that are then easier to digest by a Relying Party
   in comparison to Evidence that can potentially be both large and/or
   esoteric for a generic Relying Party.  Evidence are believable Claims
   about the Attester.  Next to Evidence, a Verifier requires
   Endorsements.  Endorsements are signed documents that include Claims
   about components of an Attester that an Attester cannot create
   Evidence about.  Very prominent examples are Roots of Trust, such as
   a Static Code Root of Trust for Measurement as defined in the Trusted
   Computing Group (TCG) Glossary [TCGGLOSS].  These Endorsements of
   components of a composite device are typically provided by their
   manufacturer, a corresponding supply chain entity that assembles a
   composite device, or a certification authority.

   This documents defines CBOR Web Token (CWT, [RFC8392]) Claims that
   can be assembled into a CWT Claims Set to compose Endorsement Tokens.

Internet-Draft               Endorsement EAT                  March 2020


   This is done in the same fashion as Claims are assembled into Entity
   Attestation Tokens [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] that can represent, for
   example, attestation Evidence for RATS.

1.1.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms Claims, Claims Set, and CBOR Web Token
   Claims set as defined in [RFC8392].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Endorsement Claims Definition

   This section uses the same definition style for Claims as introduced
   in [I-D.ietf-rats-eat].  New Claims to be used in Endorsement Tokens
   are specified below.  A JSON Web Token Claims (JWT, [RFC7519])
   definition is out-of-scope of this document.  Corresponding Claims
   are (to be) registered in the 'CWT Claims' subregistry of [IANA.cwt].

   Each Claim definition is accompanied by a value definition using the
   Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL, [RFC8610]).  An Endorsement
   Token that is using Claims that are defined in this document MUST
   include Claim values as specified in this document.

2.1.  Component Manufacturer Claim

   As a fall-back alternative to the more specific oemid Claim defined
   in [I-D.ietf-rats-eat], this Claim allows for byte strings
   representing entity identifiers that are not based on IEEE MA-L, MA-
   M, MA-S or an IEEE CID [IEEE.RA].

   manufacturer-endorsement-claim = (
     manufacturer-endorsement => bytes,
   )

2.2.  Component Version Claim

   A byte string representing a firmware version of a hardware
   component.  Potentially, the value is derived from multiple version
   numbers, such as major and minor version number.  The version
   represents the hardware component at the time the Endorsement Token
   was created, typically during manufacturing.

Internet-Draft               Endorsement EAT                  March 2020


   Note to the reader: in this -00 I-D there are only five exemplary
   Claims included yet.  This list is far from complete or polished.

   version-endorsement-claim = (
     version-endorsement => bytes,
   )

2.3.  Component Model Claim

   A manufacturer-specific byte string that represents the part number
   or a similar model identifier as defined by the manufacturer.

   model-endorsement-claim = (
     model-endorsement => bytes,
   )

2.4.  Field Upgradable Claim

   A Claim that indicates if the firmware of a hardware component is
   mutable and therefore can be updated after manufacturing or not.

   field-upgradable-claim = (
     field-upgradable => bool,
   )

2.5.  Shielded Secret Origination Claim

   An indicator that shows if a securely stored secret key in the
   hardware component was generated by a function internal to the
   hardware component or if the secret key was enrolled in a secure and
   controlled environment by the manufacturer.

   secret-origination-claim = (
     secret-origination => internal / external
   )

   internal = 0
   external = 1

2.6.  Common Criteria Claim

   A reference to the specification document that includes evaluation
   results and parameters as defined by Common Criteria.  This Claim
   value is a composite of an URI pointing to the specification document
   as well as a hash value specification document to ensure its
   authenticity.  The hash entry is a composite of an algorithm ID as
   defined by the IANA "Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry" and
   the hash value as a byte string.

   common-criteria-claim =(
     common-criteria => [ any-uri,
                          hash,
                        ]
   )

   any-uri = text

   hash = [ hash-alg-id: int,
            hash-value: bytes,
          ]

3.  Privacy Considerations

   Potentially

4.  Security Considerations

   Most likely a sub-set of the trust relationships corresponding to the
   RATS architecture

5.  IANA Considerations

   In this section the Claim registration in [IANA.cwt] for the
   corresponding Claim definition above will be elaborated on.
