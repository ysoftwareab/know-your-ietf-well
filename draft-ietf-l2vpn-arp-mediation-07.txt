     Abstract 
      
     The VPWS service [L2VPN-FRM] provides point-to-point connections 
     between pairs of Customer Edge (CE) devices.  It does so by 
     binding two Attachment Circuits (each connecting a CE device 
     with a Provider Edge, PE, device) to a pseudowire (connecting 
     the two PEs).  In general, the Attachment Circuits must be of 
     the same technology (e.g., both Ethernet, both ATM), and the 
     pseudowire must carry the frames of that technology.  However, 
     if it is known that the frames' payload consists solely of IP 
     datagrams, it is possible to provide a point-to-point connection 
     in which the pseudowire connects Attachment Circuits of 
     different technologies. This requires the PEs to perform a 
     function known as "ARP Mediation". ARP Mediation refers to the 
     process of resolving Layer 2 addresses when different resolution 
     protocols are used on either Attachment Circuit. The methods 
     described in this document are applicable even when the CEs run 
     a routing protocol between them, as long as the routing protocol 
     runs over IP.

     2. Introduction 
         
     Layer 2 Virtual Private Networks (L2VPN) are constructed over a 
     Service Provider IP backbone but are presented to the Customer 
     Edge (CE) devices as Layer 2 networks.  In theory, L2VPNs can 
     carry any Layer 3 protocol, but in many cases, the Layer 3 
     protocol is IP. Thus it makes sense to consider procedures that 
     are optimized for IP. 
      
     In a typical implementation, illustrated in the diagram below, 
     the CE devices are connected to the Provider Edge (PE) devices 
     via Attachment Circuits (AC). The ACs are Layer 2 links.  In a 
     pure L2VPN, if traffic sent from CE1 via AC1 reaches CE2 via 
     AC2, both ACs would have to be of the same type (i.e., both 
     Ethernet, both FR, etc.). However, if it is known that only IP 
     traffic will be carried, the ACs can be of different 
     technologies, provided that the PEs provide the appropriate 
     procedures to allow the proper transfer of IP packets.

     A CE, which is connected via a given type of AC, may use an IP  
     Address Resolution procedure that is specific to that type of 
     AC. For example, an Ethernet-attached CE would use ARP [ARP] and 
     a FR-attached CE might use Inverse ARP [INVARP].  If we are to 
     allow the two CEs to have a Layer 2 connection between them, 
     even though each AC uses a different Layer 2 technology, the PEs 
     must intercept and "mediate" the Layer 2 specific address 
     resolution procedures.  
      
     In this draft, we specify the procedures for VPWS services, 
     which the PEs must implement in order to mediate the IP address 
     resolution mechanism. We call these procedures "ARP Mediation".

     Consider a Virtual Private Wire Service (VPWS) constructed 
     between CE1 and CE2 in the diagram above.  If AC1 and AC2 are of 
     different technologies, e.g. AC1 is Ethernet and AC2 is Frame 
     Relay (FR), then ARP requests coming from CE1 cannot be passed 
     transparently to CE2. PE1 must interpret the meaning of the ARP 
     requests and mediate the necessary information with PE2 before 
     responding.  
      
     3. ARP Mediation (AM) function 
         
     The ARP Mediation (AM) function is an element of a PE node that 
     deals with the IP address resolution for CE devices connected 
     via an VPWS L2VPN. By placing this function in the PE node, ARP 
     Mediation is transparent to the CE devices.  
      
     For a given point-to-point connection between a pair of CEs, a 
     PE must perform the following logical steps as part of the ARP 
     Mediation procedure:  
      
        1. Discover the IP address of the locally attached CE device 
        2. Terminate, do not distribute ARP and Inverse ARP requests 
           from CE device at local PE.  
        3. Distribute those IP Addresses to the remote PE  
        4. Notify the locally attached CE of the IP address of the 
           remote CE.  
     This information is gathered using the mechanisms described in 
     the following sections. 
      
     4. IP Layer 2 Interworking Circuit 
      
     The IP Layer 2 interworking Circuit refers to interconnection of 
     the Attachment Circuit with the IP Layer 2 Transport pseudowire 
     that carries IP datagrams as the payload. The ingress PE removes 
     the data link header of its local Attachment Circuit and 
     transmits the payload (an IP packet) over the pseudowire with or 
     without the optional control word. In some cases, multiple data 
     link headers may exist, such as bridged Ethernet PDU on ATM 
     Attachment Circuit. In this case, ATM header as well as the 
     Ethernet header is removed to expose the IP packet at the 
     ingress. The egress PE encapsulates the IP packet with the data 
     link header used on its local Attachment Circuit.

                  Draft-ietf-l2vpn-arp-mediation-07.txt 
                                            
      
     The encapsulation for the IP Layer 2 Transport pseudowire is 
     described in [RFC 4447]. 
      
     5. Discovery of IP Addresses of Locally Attached CE Device  
      
     An IP Layer 2 Interworking Circuit enters monitoring state 
     immediately after the configuration. During this state it 
     performs two functions.  
      
        o  Discovery of locally attached CE IP device  
        o  Establishment of the PW  
           
     The establishment of the PW occurs independently from local CE 
     IP address discovery. During the period when the PW has been 
     established but the local CE IP device has not been discovered, 
     only broadcast/multicast IP frames are propagated between the 
     Attachment Circuit and pseudowire; unicast IP datagrams are 
     dropped. The IP destination address is used to classify 
     unicast/multicast packets.  
      
     The unicast IP frames are propagated between AC and pseudowire 
     only when CE IP devices on both Attachment Circuits have been 
     discovered, notified and proxy functions have completed. 
      
     5.1. Monitoring Local Traffic 
      
     The PE devices may learn the IP addresses of the locally 
     attached CEs from any IP traffic, such as link local multicast 
     packets (e.g., destined to 224.0.0.x), and are not restricted to 
     the operations below.   
      
     5.2. CE Devices Using ARP 
      
     If a CE device uses ARP to determine the IP address to MAC 
     address binding of its neighbor, the PE processes the ARP 
     requests to learn the IP address of local CE for the local 
     Attachment Circuit. 
      
     This document mandates that there MUST be only one CE per 
     Attachment Circuit. However, customer facing access topologies 
     may exist whereby more than one CE appears to be connected to 
     the PE on a single Attachment Circuit. For example this could be 
      
      
     Shah et al               Expires February  2007       [Page 6] 
         
                  Draft-ietf-l2vpn-arp-mediation-07.txt 
                                            
     the case when CEs are connected to a shared LAN that connects to 
     the PE. In such case, the PE MUST select one local CE. The 
     selection could be based on manual configuration or the PE may 
     optionally use following selection criteria. In either case, 
     manual configuration of IP address of the local CE (and its MAC 
     address) MUST be supported.   
      
        o  Wait to learn the IP address of the remote CE (through PW 
           signaling) and then select the local CE that is sending 
           the request for IP address of the remote CE.  
        o  Augment cross checking with the local IP address learned 
           through listening of link local multicast packets (as per 
           section 5.1 above)     
        o  Augment cross checking with the local IP address learned 
           through the Router Discovery protocol (as described below 
           in section 5.5).  
        o  There is still a possibility that the local PE may not 
           receive an IP address advertisement from the remote PE and 
           there may exist multiple local IP routers that attempt to 
           'connect' to remote CEs. In this situation, the local PE 
           may use some other criteria to select one IP device from 
           many (such as "the first ARP received"), or an operator 
           may configure the IP address of local CE. Note that the 
           operator does not have to configure the IP address of the 
           remote CE (as that would be learned through pseudowire 
           signaling).      
      
     Once the local and remote CEs has been discovered for the given 
     Attachment Circuit, the local PE responds with its own MAC 
     address to any subsequent ARP requests from the local CE with a 
     destination IP address matching the IP address of the remote CE. 
      
     The local PE signals IP address of the CE to the remote PE and 
     may initiate an unsolicited ARP response to notify the IP 
     address to MAC address binding for the remote CE to local CE 
     (again using its own MAC address).  
      
     Once the ARP mediation function is completed (i.e. the PE device 
     knows both the local and remote CE IP addresses), unicast IP 
     frames are propagated between the AC and the established PW. 
      
     The PE may periodically generate ARP request messages for the IP 
     address of the CE as a means of verifying the continued 
     existence of the address and its MAC address binding. The

     absence of a response from the CE device for a given number of 
     retries could be used as a trigger for withdrawal of the IP 
     address advertisement to the remote PE. The local PE would then 
     re-enter the address resolution phase to rediscover the IP 
     address of the attached CE. Note that this "heartbeat" scheme is 
     needed only for broadcast links (such as Ethernet AC), where the 
     failure of a CE device may otherwise be undetectable.  
      
     5.3. CE Devices Using Inverse ARP  
         
     If a CE device uses Inverse ARP to determine the IP address of 
     its neighbor, the attached PE processes the Inverse ARP request 
     from the Attachment Circuit and responds with an Inverse ARP 
     reply containing the IP address of the remote CE, if the address 
     is known. If the PE does not yet have the IP address of the 
     remote CE, it does not respond, but notes the IP address of the 
     local CE and the circuit information. Subsequently, when the IP 
     address of the remote CE becomes available, the PE may initiate 
     the Inverse ARP request as a means of notifying the IP address 
     of the remote CE to the local CE.  
      
     This is the typical mode of operation for Frame Relay and ATM 
     Attachment Circuits. If the CE does not use Inverse ARP, the PE 
     can still discover the IP address of local CE using the 
     mechanisms described in section 5.1 and 5.5 
      
     5.4. CE Devices Using PPP  
      
     The IP Control Protocol [PPP-IPCP] describes a procedure to 
     establish and configure IP on a point-to-point connection, 
     including the negotiation of IP addresses. When using IP 
     (Routed) mode L2VPN interworking, PPP negotiation is not 
     performed end-to-end between CE devices. In this case, PPP 
     negotiation takes place between the CE device and its local PE 
     device (on the PPP attachment circuit). The PE device performs 
     proxy PPP negotiation, and informs the local CE device of the IP 
     address of the remote CE device during IPCP negotiation using 
     the IP-Address option (0x03). 
       
     When a PPP link completes LCP negotiations, the local PE MAY 
     perform the following IPCP actions:

        o  The PE learns the IP address of the local CE from the 
           Configure-Request received with the IP-Address option 
           (0x03). The PE verifies that the IP address present in the 
           IP-Address option is non-zero. If the IP address is zero, 
           PE responds with Configure-Reject (as this is a request 
           from CE to assign it an IP address). Also, the Configure-
           Reject copies the IP-Address option with a zero value to 
           instruct the CE to not include that option in new 
           Configure-Request. If the IP address is non-zero, PE 
           responds with Configure-Ack.  
        o  If the PE receives Configure-Request without the IP-
           Address option, it responds with a Configure-Ack. In this 
           case the PE is unable to learn the IP address of the local 
           CE using IPCP and hence must rely on other means as 
           described in sections 5.1 and 5.5. Note that in order to 
           employ other learning mechanisms, the IPCP negotiations 
           must have reached the open state.  
        o  If the PE does not know the IP address of the remote CE, 
           it sends a Configure-Request without the IP-Address 
           option.  
        o  If the PE knows the IP address of the remote CE, it sends 
           a Configure-Request with the IP-Address option containing 
           the IP address of the remote CE.       
      
     The IPCP IP-Address option MAY be negotiated between the PE and 
     the local CE device. Configuration of other IPCP options MAY be 
     rejected. Other NCPs, with the exception of the Compression 
     Control Protocol (CCP) and Encryption Control Protocol (ECP), 
     MUST be rejected. The PE device MAY reject configuration of the 
     CCP and ECP.   
           
     5.5. Router Discovery method  
      
     In order to learn the IP address of the CE device for a given 
     Attachment Circuit, the PE device may execute Router Discovery 
     Protocol [RFC 1256] whereby a Router Discovery Request (ICMP - 
     router solicitation) message is sent using a source IP address 
     of zero. The IP address of the CE device is extracted from the 
     Router Discovery Response (ICMP - router advertisement) message 
     from the CE. It is possible that the response contains more than 
     one router addresses with the same preference level; in which 
     case, some heuristics (such as first on the list) is necessary.  
     The use of the Router Discovery method by the PE is optional.

     5.6. Manual Configuration  
      
     In some cases, it may not be possible to discover the IP address 
     of the local CE device using the mechanisms described in section 
     5 above. In such cases manual configuration MAY be used. All 
     implementations of this draft MUST support manual configuration 
     of the IP address of the local CE. 
           
           
     6. CE IP Address Signaling between PEs  
         
     6.1. When to Signal an IP address of a CE   
      
     A PE device advertises the IP address of the attached CE only 
     when the encapsulation type of the pseudowire is IP Layer2 
     Transport (the value 0x0000B, as defined in [PWE3-IANA]). It is 
     quite possible that the IP address of a CE device is not 
     available at the time the PW labels are signaled. For example, 
     in Frame Relay the CE device sends an inverse ARP request only 
     when the DLCI is active. If the PE signals the DLCI to be active 
     only when it has received the IP address along with the PW FEC 
     from the remote PE, a chicken and egg situation arises. In order 
     to avoid such problems, the PE must be prepared to advertise the 
     PW FEC before the IP address of the CE is known and hence uses 
     IP address value zero. When the IP address of the CE device does 
     become available, the PE re-advertises the PW FEC along with the 
     IP address of the CE.   
      
     Similarly, if the PE detects that an IP address of a CE is no 
     longer valid (by methods described above), the PE must re-
     advertise the PW FEC with null IP address to denote the 
     withdrawal of IP address of the CE. The receiving PE then waits 
     for notification of the remote IP address. During this period, 
     propagation of unicast IP traffic is suspended, but multicast IP 
     traffic can continue to flow between the AC and the pseudowire.  
      
     If two CE devices are locally attached to the PE where one CE is 
     connected to an Ethernet port and the other to a Frame Relay 
     port, for example, the IP addresses are learned in the same 
     manner described above. However, since the CE devices are local, 
     the distribution of IP addresses for these CE devices is a local 
     step.

     6.2. LDP Based Distribution  
      
     [RFC 4447] uses Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) transport to 
     exchange PW FECs in the Label Mapping message in the Downstream 
     Unsolicited (DU) mode. The PW FEC comes in two flavors; PWid and 
     Generalized ID FEC elements and has some common fields between 
     them. The discussions below refer to these common fields for IP 
     L2 Interworking encapsulation.   
          
     In addition to PW-FEC, this document defines an IP address list 
     TLV that must be included in the optional parameter field of the 
     Label Mapping message when advertising the PW FEC for the IP 
     Layer2 Transport. The use of optional parameters in the Label 
     Mapping message to extend the attributes of the PW FEC is 
     specified in the [RFC 4447].   
           
     As defined in [RFC 4447], when processing a received PW FEC, the 
     PE matches the PW ID and PW type with the locally configured PW 
     ID and PW Type. If there is a match, and if the PW Type is IP 
     Layer2 Transport the PE further checks for the presence of an 
     Address List TLV (as specified in [RFC 3036]) in the optional 
     parameter TLVs. If absent, a Label Release message is issued 
     with a Status Code meaning "IP Address of the CE is absent" 
     [note: Status Code 0x0000002D is pending IANA allocation] to 
     reject the PW establishment. 
           
     We use the Address List TLV as defined in RFC 3036 to signal the 
     IP address of the local CE. This IP address list TLV must be 
     included in the optional parameter field of the Label Mapping 
     message, and MUST contain exactly one address of family IPv4.  
              
     Encoding of the IP Address List TLV is:   
      
     0                   1                   2                   3

     Address Family   
          Two octet quantity containing a value from the ADDRESS 
          FAMILY NUMBERS from ADDRESS FAMILY NUMBERS in [RFC 1700] 
          that encodes the address contained in the Address field.   
                
     IP Address of CE   
          IP address of the CE attached to the advertising PE.  The      
          encoding of the individual address depends on the Address 
          Family.   
                
     The following address encodings are defined by this version of 
     the protocol:   
                
                    Address Family      Address Encoding

     The IP address field is set to all zeroes to denote that 
     advertising PE has not learned the IP address of its local CE 
     device. Any non-zero value of the IP address field denotes the 
     IP address of advertising PE's attached CE device. 
      
     The IP address of the CE is also supplied in the optional 
     parameters field of the LDP Notification message along with the 
     PW FEC. The LDP Notification message is used to signal any 
     change in the status of the CE's IP address.  
      
     The encoding of the LDP Notification message is as follows.

     7. IANA Considerations    
         
     7.1. LDP Status messages  
      
     This document uses new LDP status codes, IANA already maintains 
     a registry of name "STATUS CODE NAME SPACE" defined by RFC 3036. 
     The following values are suggested for assignment:  
         
        0x0000002C "IP Address of CE"  
        0x0000002D "IP Address of the CE is absent" 
      
     8. How a CE Learns the IP address of a remote CE   
      
     Once the local PE has received the IP address information of the 
     remote CE from the remote PE, it will either initiate an address 
     resolution request or respond to an outstanding request from the 
     attached CE device.  
           
     8.1. CE Devices Using ARP 
      
     When the PE learns IP address of the remote CE as described in 
     section 6.1 and 6.2, it may or may not already know IP address 
     of the local CE. If the IP address is not known, the PE must 
     wait until it is acquired through one of the methods described 
     in sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.5. If IP address of the local CE is 
     known, the PE may choose to generate an unsolicited ARP message 
     to notify the local CE about the binding of the IP address of 
     the remote CE with the PE's own MAC address.  
      
     When the local CE generates an ARP request, the PE must proxy 
     the ARP response [PROXY-ARP] using its own MAC address as the 
     source hardware address and IP address of remote CE as the 
     source protocol address. The PE must respond only to those ARP 
     requests whose destination protocol address matches the IP 
     address of the remote CE.

     8.2. CE Devices Using Inverse ARP  
      
     When the PE learns the IP address of the remote CE, it should 
     generate an Inverse ARP request. If the Attachment Circuit 
     requires activation (e.g. Frame Relay) the PE should activate it 
     first before the Inverse ARP request. It should be noted, that 
     PE might never receive the response to its own request, nor see 
     any Inverse ARP request from the CE, in cases where CE is pre-
     configured with IP address of the remote CE or where the use of 
     Inverse ARP has not been enabled. In either case the CE has used 
     other means to learn the IP address of his neighbor.  
           
     8.3. CE Devices Using PPP  
      
     When the PE learns the IP address of the remote CE, it should 
     initiate a Configure-Request and set the IP-Address option to 
     the IP address of the remote CE to notify the IP address of the 
     remote CE to the local CE.  
             
     9. Use of IGPs with IP L2 Interworking L2VPNs   
      
     In an IP L2 interworking L2VPN, when an IGP on a CE connected to 
     a broadcast link is cross-connected with an IGP on a CE 
     connected to a point-to-point link, there are routing protocol 
     related issues that must be addressed. The link state routing 
     protocols are cognizant of the underlying link characteristics 
     and behave accordingly when establishing neighbor adjacencies, 
     representing the network topology, and passing protocol packets.  
         
     9.1. OSPF   
      
     The OSPF protocol treats a broadcast link type with a special 
     procedure that engages in neighbor discovery to elect a 
     designated and a backup designated router (DR and BDR 
     respectively) with which each other router on the link forms 
     adjacencies. However, these procedures are neither applicable 
     nor understood by OSPF running on a point-to-point link. By 
     cross-connecting two neighbors with disparate link types, an IP 
     L2 interworking L2VPN may experience connectivity issues.  
      
     Additionally, the link type specified in the router LSA will not 
     match for the two cross-connected routers. 
      
      
      
     Shah et al               Expires February  2007       [Page 14] 
         
                  Draft-ietf-l2vpn-arp-mediation-07.txt 
                                            
     Finally, each OSPF router generates network LSAs when connected 
     to a broadcast link such as Ethernet, receipt of which by an 
     OSPF router which believes itself to be connected to a point-to-
     point link further adds to the confusion.      
      
     Fortunately, the OSPF protocol provides a configuration option 
     (ospfIfType), whereby OSPF will treat the underlying physical 
     broadcast link as a point-to-point link.  
      
     It is strongly recommended that all OSPF protocols on CE devices 
     connected to Ethernet interfaces use this configuration option 
     when attached to a PE that is participating in an IP L2 
     Interworking VPN.       
           
     9.2. RIP   
      
     RIP protocol broadcasts RIP advertisements every 30 seconds. If 
     the multicast/broadcast traffic snooping mechanism is used as 
     described in section 5.1, the attached PE can learn the local CE 
     router's IP address from the IP header of its advertisements. No 
     special configuration is required for RIP in this type of Layer 
     2 IP Interworking L2VPN. 
        
     9.3. IS-IS 
         
     The IS-IS protocol does not encapsulate its PDUs in IP, and 
     hence cannot be supported in IP L2 Interworking L2VPNs. 
        
     10. IPV6 Considerations  
      
     The support for IPV6 is not addressed in this draft and is for 
     future study.  
      
     11. Multi-domain considerations
     
     In a back-to-back configuration, when two PEs are connected with 
     Ethernet, the ARP proxy function has limited application as 
     there is no local CE.

     Consider a Multi-domain network topology as shown above where PW 
     segment 1 (PE1<->PE2) is in network A and PW segment 2 (PE3<->
     PE4) is in network B. In this configuration CE1 is connected to 
     PE1 and CE2 is connected to PE4. PE2 on network A is directly 
     connected to PE3 in network B with Ethernet. In this 
     configuration there needs to be a mechanism for PE2 and PE3 to 
     learn IP addresses of the CEs present in each other’s network. 
     The two options to do this are as follows. 
      
        o  Configure CE2’s IP address as a local CE’s IP address at 
           PE2 and CE1’s IP address as local CE’s IP address at PE3. 
           Additionally, PE2 and PE3 are required to generate ARP 
           requests using their own MAC addresses as the source 
           address. These PEs are in effect proxying for CEs present 
           in the each other’s network. This is not a desirable 
           option as it requires configuration of IP address of a CE 
           that is present in others (possibly other service 
           provider’s) network. 
        o  In the second option, PE2 and PE3 use gratuitous ARP which 
           eliminates configuration of IP addresses of the CEs. In 
           this scheme, when PE2 learns the IP address of CE1 
           (through LDP signaling), PE2 sends a gratuitous ARP to PE3 
           with the source and destination IP address field set to 
           CE1’s IP address and the source MAC address field set to 
           PE2’s MAC address. When PE3 learns the IP address of CE1 
           (from the gratuitous ARP), PE3 notifies PE4 of the IP 
           address of the CE1 through LDP signaling. Similarly, for 
           the traffic in the opposite direction, when PE3 learns the 
           IP address of CE2, it sends a gratuitous ARP to PE2. PE2 
           sends an IP address notification, via LDP, of CE2’s IP 
           address to PE1 using the same procedures described above. 
           This allows PE2 and PE3 to dynamically learn the IP 
           addresses of the CEs present in each other’s networks. 
           This is the preferred mode of operation as compared to the

     12.1. Control plane security  
      
     Control plane security pertains to establishing the LDP 
     connection, and to pseudowire signaling and CE IP address 
     distribution over that LDP connection. The LDP connection 
     between two trusted PEs can be achieved by each PE verifying the 
     incoming connection against the configured address of the peer 
     and authenticating the LDP messages using MD5 authentication. 
     Pseudowire signaling between two secure LDP peers do not pose 
     security issue but mis-wiring could occur due to configuration 
     error. Some checks, such as, proper pseudowire type and other 
     pseudowire options may prevent mis-wiring due to configuration 
     errors.  
      
     Learning the IP address of the appropriate CE can be a security 
     issue. It is expected that the Attachment Circuit to the local 
     CE will be physically secured. If this is a concern, the PE must 
     be configured with IP and MAC address of the CE when connected 
     with Ethernet or IP and virtual circuit information (DLCI or 
     VPI/VCI when connected over Frame Relay or ATM and IP address 
     only when connected over PPP). During each ARP/inARP frame 
     processing, the PE must verify the received information against 
     local configuration before forwarding the information to the 
     remote PE to protect against hijacking the connection. 
          
     12.2. Data plane security  
      
     The data traffic between CE and PE is not encrypted and it is 
     possible that in an insecure environment, a malicious user may 
     tap into the CE to PE connection and generate traffic using the 
     spoofed destination MAC address on the Ethernet Attachment 
     Circuit. In order to avoid such hijacking, local PE may verify 
     the source MAC address of the received frame against the MAC 
     address of the admitted connection. The frame is forwarded to PW 
     only when authenticity is verified. When spoofing is detected, 
     PE must sever the connection with the local CE, tear down the PW 
     and start over.
