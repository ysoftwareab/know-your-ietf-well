        Additional Criteria for Nominating Committee Eligibility
                 draft-carpenter-eligibility-expand-10

Abstract

   This document defines a process experiment under RFC 3933 that
   temporarily updates the criteria for qualifying volunteers to
   participate in the IETF Nominating Committee.  It therefore also
   updates the criteria for qualifying signatories to a community recall
   petition.  The purpose is to make the criteria more flexible in view
   of increasing remote participation in the IETF and a reduction in
   face-to-face meetings.  The experiment is of fixed duration and will
   apply to one, or at most two, consecutive Nominating Committee
   cycles, starting in 2021.  This document temporarily varies the rules
   in RFC 8713.

Internet-Draft       Additional Eligibility Criteria        January 2021


1.  Introduction

   According to [RFC8713], the IETF Nominating Committee (NomCom) is
   populated from a pool of volunteers with a specified record of
   attendance at IETF plenary meetings, which were assumed to be face-
   to-face meetings when that document was approved.  In view of the
   cancellation of the IETF 107, 108, 109 and 110 face-to-face meetings,
   the risk of future cancellations, the probability of less frequent
   face-to-face meetings in future in support of sustainability, and a
   general increase in remote participation, this document defines a
   process experiment [RFC3933] of fixed duration (described in
   Section 2) to use modified and additional criteria to qualify
   volunteers.

   During this experiment, the eligibility criteria for signing recall
   petitions - which [RFC8713] defines to be the same as those for
   NomCom eligibility - are consequently also modified as described in
   this document.  This experiment has no other effect on the recall
   process.

2.  Term and Evaluation of the Experiment

   The cancellation of the in-person IETF 107 through 110 meetings means
   that the current criteria are in any case seriously perturbed for at
   least two years.  The experiment therefore needs to start as soon as
   possible.  However, the experiment did not apply to the selection of
   the 2020-2021 Nominating Committee, which was performed according to
   [RFC8788].

   The experiment will initially cover the IETF Nominating Committee
   cycle that begins in 2021.  As soon as the entire 2021-2022
   Nominating Committee is seated, the IESG must consult the 2021-2022
   Nominating Committee chair and the 2020-2021 Nominating Committee
   chair (who will maintain NomCom confidentiality) and publish a report
   on the results of the experiment.  Points to be considered are
   whether the experiment has produced a sufficiently large and diverse
   pool of individuals, whether enough of those individuals have
   volunteered to produce a representative Nominating Committee with
   good knowledge of the IETF, and whether all the goals in Section 3
   have been met.  If possible, a comparison with results from the
   previous procedure (i.e., RFC 8713) should be made.

   The IESG must then also begin a community discussion of whether to:

   1.  Amend [RFC8713] in time for the 2022-2023 Nominating Committee
       cycle; or

Internet-Draft       Additional Eligibility Criteria        January 2021


   2.  Prolong the current experiment for a second and final year with
       additional clarifications specific to the 2022-2023 cycle; or

   3.  Run a different experiment for the next nominating cycle; or

   4.  Revert to [RFC8713].

   The IESG will announce the results of the consensus determination of
   this discussion in good time for the 2022-2023 Nominating Committee
   cycle to commence.

   In the event of prolongation of this experiment for a second year,
   the IESG will repeat the consultation, report and community
   discussion process accordingly, but this document lapses at the end
   of the 2022-2023 Nominating Committee cycle.

3.  Goals

   The goals of the modified and additional criteria are as follows:

   *  Mitigate the issue of active remote (or rarely in-person)
      participants being disenfranchised in the NomCom and recall
      processes.

   *  Enable the selection of a 2021-2022 NomCom, and possibly a
      2022-2023 NomCom, when it is impossible for anyone to have
      attended three out of the last five IETF meetings in person.

   *  Prepare for an era in which face-to-face plenary meetings are less
      frequent (thus extending the issue to many, perhaps a majority, of
      participants).

   *  Ensure that those eligible have enough current understanding of
      IETF practices and people to make informed decisions.

   *  Provide algorithmic criteria, so that the Secretariat can check
      them mechanically against available data.

4.  Criteria

   This experiment specifies several alternative paths to qualification,
   replacing the single criterion in section 4.14 of [RFC8713].  Any one
   of the paths is sufficient, unless the person is otherwise
   disqualified under section 4.15 of [RFC8713]:

   *  Path 1: The person has registered for and attended 3 out of the
      last 5 IETF meetings.  For meetings held entirely online, online
      registration and attendance counts as attendance.  For the

Internet-Draft       Additional Eligibility Criteria        January 2021


      2021-2022 Nominating Committee, the meetings concerned will be
      IETF 106, 107, 108, 109, and 110.  Attendance is as determined by
      the record keeping of the secretariat for in-person meetings, and
      based on being a registered person who logged in for at least one
      session of an online IETF meeting.

   *  Path 2: Has been a Working Group Chair or Secretary within the 3
      years prior to the day the call for NomCom volunteers is sent to
      the community.

   *  Path 3: Has been a listed author or editor (on the front page) of
      at least 2 IETF stream RFCs within the last 5 years prior to the
      day the call for NomCom volunteers is sent to the community.  An
      Internet-Draft that has been approved by the IESG and is in the
      RFC Editor queue counts the same as a published RFC, with the
      relevant date being the date the draft was added to the RFC Editor
      queue.  For avoidance of doubt, the 5 year timer extends back to
      the date 5 years before the date when the call for NomCom
      volunteers is sent to the community.

   Notes:

   *  Path 1 corresponds approximately to [RFC8713], modified as per
      [RFC8788].

   *  Path 3 includes approved drafts, since some documents spend a long
      time in the RFC Editor's queue.

   *  Path 3 extends to 5 years because it commonly takes 3 or 4 years
      for new documents to be approved in the IETF stream, so 3 years
      would be too short a sampling period.

   *  All the required data are available to the IETF Secretariat from
      meeting attendance records or the IETF data tracker.

4.1.  Clarifying Detail

   Path 1 does not qualify people who register and attend face-to-face
   meetings remotely.  That is, it does not qualify remote attendees at
   IETF 106, because that meeting took place prior to any question of
   cancelling meetings.

   If the IESG prolongs this experiment for a second year, as allowed by
   Section 2, the IESG must also clarify how Path 1 applies to IETF 111,
   112 and 113.

5.  Omitted Criteria

   During community discussions of this document, certain criteria were
   rejected as not truly indicating effective IETF participation, or as
   being unlikely to significantly expand the volunteer pool.  These
   included authorship of individual or Working-Group-adopted Internet-
   Drafts, sending email to IETF lists, reviewing drafts, acting as a
   BOF Chair, and acting in an external role for the IETF (liaisons
   etc.).

   One path, service in the IESG or IAB within the last 5 years, was
   found to have no benefit since historical data show that such people
   always appear to be qualified by another path.

   Since the criteria must be measurable by the Secretariat, no
   qualitative evaluation of an individual's contributions is
   considered.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document should not affect the security of the Internet.

Appendix A.  Available data

   An analysis of how some of the above criteria would affect the number
   of NomCom-qualified participants if applied in August 2020 has been
   performed.  The results are presented below in Venn diagrams as
   Figure 1 to Figure 4.  Note that the numbers shown differ slightly
   from manual counts due to database mismatches, and the results were
   not derived at the normal time of the year for NomCom formation.  The
   remote attendee lists for IETF 107 and 108 were used, although not
   yet available on the IETF web site.

   A specific difficulty is that the databases involved inevitably
   contain a few inconsistencies such as duplicate entries, differing
   versions of a person's name, and impersonal authors.  (For example,
   "IAB" qualifies under Path 3, and one actual volunteer artificially
   appears not to qualify.)  This underlines that automatically
   generated lists of eligible and qualified people will always require
   manual checking.

   The first two diagrams illustrate how the new paths (2 and 3) affect
   eligibility numbers compared to the meeting participation path (1).
   Figure 1 gives the raw numbers, and Figure 2 removes those
   disqualified according to RFC 8713.  The actual 2020 volunteer pool
   is shown too.
