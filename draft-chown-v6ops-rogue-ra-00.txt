Abstract

   When deploying IPv6 networks, whether IPv6-only or dual-stack,
   routers are configured to use IPv6 Router Advertisements to convey
   information to on link nodes that enable them to autoconfigure on the
   network.  This information includes the implied default router
   address taken from the observed source address of the Router
   Advertisement (RA) message.  However, in some networks 'bogus' RAs
   are observed, which may be present due to misconfigurations or

   possibly malicious attacks on the network.  In this draft we
   summarise the scenarios in which rogue RAs may be observed, and we
   present a list of possible solutions to the problem.  The goal of
   this draft is to present a framework around which solutions can be
   proposed and discussed.

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2007


1.  Introduction

   The Neighbor Discovery protocol [6] describes the operation of IPv6
   Router Advertisements (RAs), which are used during the IPv6
   autoconfiguration process, whether stateful (via DHCPv6 [1] or DHCPv6
   Light [2]) or stateless (as per RFC4862 [7]).  In either case, the
   default router address is drawn from the RA.  There is currently no
   DHCPv6 option to configure a default gateway address.

   In observing the operation of deployed IPv6 networks, it is apparent
   that there is a problem with undesired or 'bogus' IPv6 Router
   Advertisements (RAs) appearing on network links or subnets.  By
   'bogus' we mean RAs that were not the intended configured RAs, rather
   RAs that have appeared for some other reason.

   The problem with rogue RAs is that they can cause partial or complete
   failure of operation on an IPv6 link.  As such they are an
   operational issue for which solution(s) are required, and for which
   best practice needs to be conveyed.

   In the next section, we discuss the scenarios that may give rise to
   rogue RAs being present.  In the following section we present some
   candidate solutions for the problem, some of which may be more
   practical to deploy than others.


2.  Bogus RA Scenarios

   There are three broad classes of scenario in which bogus RAs may be
   introduced to an IPv6 network.

2.1.  Administrator misconfiguration

   Here an administrator incorrectly configures RAs on a router
   interface, causing incorrect RAs to appear on links and hosts to
   generate incorrect IPv6 address or other information.  In this case
   the default gateway may be correct, but a host might for example
   become multi-addressed, possibly with a correct and incorrect address
   based on a correct and incorrect prefix.  In the case of a Layer 2
   VLAN misconfiguration, RAs may 'flood' to unintended links, causing
   hosts or more than one link to potentially become incorrectly
   multiaddressed.  There is also the possibility of bad lifetime
   information being configured.

2.2.  User misconfiguration

   In this case a user's device 'accidentally' transmits RAs onto the
   local link, adding an addition default gateway and prefix

   information.  This is typically seen on wireless (though sometimes
   wired) networks where a laptop has been used as a home gateway (e.g.
   a 6to4 gateway) and has then been attached to another network with
   the gateway configuration still active.

2.3.  Malicious misconfiguration

   Here an attacker is deliberately generating RAs on the local network
   in an attempt to perform some form of denial of service or man-in-
   the-middle attack.


3.  Methods to Mitigate against Rogue RAs

   In this section we present a summary of methods suggested to date for
   reducing or removing the possibility of rogue RAs being seen on a
   network.

3.1.  Manual configuration

   The default gateway can usually be manually configured on a device.
   This is of course a resource intensive solution, and also prone to
   mistakes.

3.2.  Secure Neighbor Discovery

   The SEND [3] protocol provides a method for hosts and routers to
   perform secure Neighbor Discovery.  At present there are very few
   SEND implementations available, and SEND is perceived as a complex
   protocol to deploy.

3.3.  Introduce RA snooping

   It should be possible to implement 'RA snooping' in Layer 2 switches
   in a similar way to DHCP snooping, such that RAs observed from
   incorrect sources are blocked or dropped, and not propagated through
   a subnet.  One candidate solution in this space called RA-Guard [8]
   has recently been proposed.  This type of solution has appeal because
   it is a familiar model for enterprise network managers.

3.4.  Password option

   Some form of password option a la RIP could be introduced.  It is not
   clear how exactly this could be implemented or used, so it is not
   considered a serious option at present.

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2007


3.5.  Use the Router Preference Option

   RFC4191 [4] introduced router preference options, such that an RA
   could carry one of three router preference values: High, Medium
   (default) or Low. Thus an administrator could use High settings for
   managed RAs, and hope that 'accidental' RAs would be medium priority,
   and that hosts implemented this optional protocol.

3.6.  Rely on Layer 2 admission control

   In principle, if a technology such as IEEE 802.1x is used, devices
   would first need to authenticate to the network before being able to
   send or receive IPv6 traffic.  Ideally authentication would be
   mutual.  This may mitigate against a malicious attacker, but doesn't
   address the misconfiguration issues.

3.7.  Use host-based packet filters

   In a managed environment hosts could be configured via their
   'personal firewall' to only accept RAs from trusted sources.
   However, the problem is then pushed to keeping this configuration
   maintained and correct.  If a router fails and is replaced, possibly
   with a new Layer 2 interface address, the link local source address
   in the filter may be incorrect and no network exists to push the new
   information to the host.

   Also, hosts could potentially be configured to discard 6to4-based RAs
   in a managed enterprise environment.

3.8.  Use an 'intelligent' deprecation tool

   It could be possible to run a daemon on a link (perhaps on the router
   on the link) to watch for incorrect RAs and to send a deprecating RA
   with router lifetime of zero when such an RA is observed.  The KAME
   rafixd is an example of such a tool, which has been used at IETF
   meetings with some success.  Whether or not such a tool is the
   preferred method, monitoring a link for observed RAs seems prudent
   from a network management perspective.  Some such tools exist
   already, e.g. ndpmon.

3.9.  Add a Default Gateway Option to DHCPv6

   It may be possible to define a new Default Gateway Option for DHCPv6
   that would allow network administrators to only have hosts use DHCPv6
   for default gateway configuration in managed networks.  While such an
   option could be defined, its ramifications remain unclear.  In the
   absence of RAs, other configuration information would also be
   missing, e.g. on-link prefix information.  Of course, it may be that



Chown & Venaas            Expires May 15, 2008                  [Page 5]

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2007


   an RA is still required to inform the host to use DHCPv6, and that
   may introduce a Catch-22 unless hosts are configured directly to only
   use DHCPv6.

   An advantage of DHCPv6 is that should an error be introduced, only
   hosts that have refreshed their DHCP information since that time are
   affected, while a rogue RA will most likely affect all hosts
   immediately.  DHCPv6 also allows different answers to be given to
   different hosts.

   One objection to introducing such an option is that DHCPv6 in itself
   is not a secure protocol - use of Authenticated DHCP is currently
   minimal and thus the (lack of) security is just pushed to another
   place, albeit one that site administrators are more familiar and
   (rightly or wrongly) comfortable with.


4.  Other considerations

   There are other general observations that have been made.

   One is that it would generally be prudent for network monitoring or
   management platforms to be able to observe and report on observed
   RAs, and whether unintended RAs (possibly from unintended sources)
   are present on a network.  Further, it may be useful for individual
   hosts to be able to report their address status, e.g. this could be
   useful during an IPv6 renumbering phased process as described in
   RFC4192 [5].

   The second is how readily a host can recover from bad configuration
   information, e.g. considering the '2 hour rule' of Section 5.5.3 of
   RFC4862 (though this applies to the prefix lifetime not the router
   lifetime).  We should ensure that methods exist for a network
   administrator to correct bad configuration information on a link or
   subnet, and that OS platforms support these methods.


5.  Conclusions

   In this text we have described scenarios via which rogue Router
   Advertisements (RAs) may appear on a network, and some measures that
   could be used to mitigate against these.

   While SEND perhaps offers the most robust solution, implementations
   are not widely available, and the solution is perceived as complex
   (parallels can possibly be drawn with Authenticated DHCP in terms of
   likely deployment).  Adding a new DHCPv6 Default Gateway Option would
   allow configuration by DHCP, and be a method that IPv4 administrators

Internet-Draft      Rogue IPv6 Router Advertisements       November 2007


   are comfortable with (for better or worse), but one must recognise
   that the risk is then shifted elsewhere.

   Further feedback on the solutions is certainly welcome.  In the
   meantime, perhaps the simplest initial step would be for RA snooping
   to be defined and deployed for Layer 2 devices, in such a way that
   can address (shared) wireless as well as wired networks.  One draft
   proposal in this space, RA-Guard, has recently been published [8].

   This topic has also highlighted that some DHCPv6 on-link prefix
   option may be useful for some scenarios, caused in part by the change
   of the 'default on-link' rule.  This should be seen as independent of
   whether DHCPv6 is extended to add a Default Gateway Option, which is
   another open question at this time.

   The material presented here is relevant to the IETF dhc and v6ops
   working groups, but the text is labelled as v6ops due to its
   operational issue focus.  Should new DHCP features be defined as a
   result, we assume these would be presented within the dhc working
   group.
