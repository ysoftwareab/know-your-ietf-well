Abstract

   The MediaCtrl work group in the IETF is currently proposing an
   architecture for controlling media services.  The Session Initiation
   Protocol(SIP) will be used as the signalling protocol which provides
   many inherent capabilities for message routing.  In addition to such
   signalling properties, a need exists for intelligent, application
   level media service selection based on non-static signalling
   properties.  This is especially true when considered in conjunction
   with deployment architectures that include 1:M and M:M combinations
   of Application Servers and Media Servers.

Internet-Draft          Media Resource Brokering           February 2008


1.  Introduction

   The topic of Media Resources has been in discussion for a number of
   years with varying proprietary solutions being used today.  It is
   clear that as we move towards a consistent architecture and protocol
   for Media Server Control, a standard mechanism is required for
   accurate media resource location.

   As IP based telecom infrastructures mature, the complexity and
   demands from deployments increase.  Such complexity will result in a
   wide variety of capabilities from a range of vendors that should all
   be interoperable using the architecture and protocols produced by the
   MediaCtrl work group.  It should be possible for a controlling entity
   to be assisted in Media Server selection so that the most appropriate
   resource is selected for a particular operation.  The importance
   increases when you introduce a flexible level of deployment
   scenarios, as specified in the MediaCtrl Requirements
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-requirements] and MediaCtrl Architecture
   [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-architecture] documents.  These documents make
   statements like "it should be possible to have a many-to-many
   relationship between Application Servers and Media Servers that use
   this protocol".  This leads to the following deployment architectures
   being possible when considering media resources.

   The simplest deployment view is illustrated in Figure 1.



   +---+-----+---+                         +---+-----+---+
   | Application |                         |    Media    |
   |   Server    |<-------MS Control------>|    Server   |
   +-------------+                         +-------------+



                       Figure 1: Basic Architecture

   This simply involves a single Application Server and Media Server.
   Expanding on this view, it is also possible for an Application Server
   to be controlling multiple (greater that 1) Media Servers.  This
   deployment view is illustrated in Figure 2.  Typically, such
   architectures are associated with application logic that requires
   high demand media services.  It is more than possible that each media
   server possesses a different media capability set.  Media servers may
   offer different media services as specified in the Mediactrl
   architecture document.  A Media server may have similar media
   functionality but may have different capacity or media codec support.

                                           |    Media    |

                                    |

                                    |
                                    |      +---+-----+---+
                                    +----->|    Media    |
                                           |    Server   |
                                           +-------------+


                       Figure 2: Basic Architecture

   Figure 3 conveys the opposite view to that in Figure 2.  In this
   model there are a number of (greater than 1) application servers
   controlling a single media server.  Typically, such architectures are
   associated with application logic that requires low demand media
   services.


   +---+-----+---+
   | Application |
   |   Server    |<-----+
   +-------------+      |
                        |

   | Application |      |                  |    Media    |

   +---+-----+---+      |
   | Application |      |
   |   Server    |<-----+
   +-------------+



                       Figure 3: Basic Architecture

   The final deployment view is the most complex.  In this model (M:M)
   there exists any number of Application Servers and any number of
   Media Servers.  It is again possible in this model that media servers
   might not be homogenous and have different capability sets.

   This document will take a look at the specific problem areas related
   to such deployment architectures.  It is recognised that the
   solutions proposed in this document should be equally adaptable to
   all of the previously described deployment models.  It is also
   recognised that the solution is far more relevant to some of the
   previously discussed deployment models and can almost be viewed as
   redundant on others.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   In this document, BCP 14/RFC 2119 [RFC2119] defines the key words
   "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
   "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL".  In addition, BCP 15 indicates requirement levels for
   compliant implementations.

   This document inherits terminology proposed in the MediaCtrl
   Architecture [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-architecture] and MediaCtrl SIP
   Control Framework [I-D.ietf-mediactrl-sip-control-framework]
   documents.  In addition, the following terms are defined for use in
   this document and for use in the context of the MediaCtrl Work group
   in the IETF:

   Media Resource Broker (MRB)  A logical entity that is responsible for
      both collection of appropriate published Media Server (MS)
      information and supplying of appropriate MS information to
      consuming entities.

   Query MRB  An instantiation of an MRB (See previous definition) that
      provides an interface for an Application Server to retrieve the
      location of an appropriate Media Server.  The result returned to
      the Application Server can be influenced by information contained
      in the query request.

   In-line MRB  An instantiation of an MRB (See definition) that
      directly receives requests on the signalling path.  The decision
      making process is totally delegated to the MRB.

3.  Problem Discussion

   It is clear from Section 1 that the MediaCtrl group will be producing
   a solution that must service a wide variety of deployment
   architectures.  These range from the simplest 1:1 relationship
   between Media Servers and Application Servers to potentially linearly
   scaling 1:M, M:1 and M:M deployments.

   This still does not seem like a major issue for the proposed solution
   until you add a number of additional factors into the equation that
   increase complexity.  As Media Servers evolve it must be taken into
   consideration that where many can exist in a deployment, they may not
   have been produced by the same vendor and may not have the same
   capability set.  It should be possible for an Application Server that
   exists in a deployment to select a Media Service based on a common,
   appropriate capability set.  In conjunction with capabilities, it is
   also important to take available resources into consideration.  The
   ability to select an appropriate Media Service function is an
   extremely useful feature but becomes even more powerful when
   considered in conjunction with available resources for servicing a
   request.

   In conclusion, the intention is to create a tool set that allows
   MediaCtrl deployments to effectively utilize the available media
   resources.  It should be noted that in the simplest deployments where
   only a single media server exists, an MRB function is probably not
   required.  Only a single capability set exists and resource
   unavailability can be handled using the appropriate underlying
   signalling e.g.  SIP response.  This document does not prohibit such
   uses of an MRB, it simply provides the tools for various entities to
   interact where appropriate.  It is also worth noting that the tools
   provided in this document aim to provide a 'best effort' view of
   media resources at the time of request for initial Media Server
   routing decisions.  Any dramatic change in media capabilities after a
   request has taken place should be handled by the underlying protocol.

4.  Deployment Scenario Options

   On researching Media Resource Brokering it became clear that a couple
   of high level models exist.  The general principles of "in-line" and
   "query" MRB concepts are discussed in the rest of this section.

4.1.  Query MRB

   The "Query" model for MRB interactions provides the ability for a
   client of media services (for example an Application Server) to "ask"
   an MRB for an appropriate Media Server, as illustrated in Figure 5.

          |                          |     +-------------+   |   |

                                           +---+-----+---+


                            Figure 5: Query MRB

   In this deployment, the Media Servers use the "Media Server Resource
   Publishing Interface", as discussed in Section 5.1, to convey
   capability sets as well as resource information.  This is depicted by
   (1) in Figure 5.  It is then the MRB's responsibility to accumulate
   all appropriate information relating to media services in the logical
   deployment cluster.  The Application Server (or other media services
   client) is then able to query the MRB for an appropriate resource (as
   identified by (2) in Figure 5).  Such a query would carry specific
   information related to the Media Service required and enable the MRB
   to provide an increased accuracy in its response.  This particular
   interface is discussed in "Media Resource Consumer Interface" in
   Section 5.2.  The Application Server is then able to direct control
   commands (for example create conference) and Media Dialogs to the

   appropriate Media Server, as shown by (3) in Figure 5.

4.1.1.  Hybrid Query MRB

   As mentioned previously, it is the intention that a tool kit is
   provided for MRB functionality within a MediaCtrl architecture.  It
   is expected that in specific deployment scenarios the role of the MRB
   might be co-hosted as a hybrid logical entity with an Application
   Server, as shown in Figure 6.

                  Figure 6: Hybrid Query MRB - AS Hosted

   This diagram is identical to that in Figure 5 with the exception that
   the MRB is now hosted on the Application Server.  The "Media Server
   Publishing Interface" is still being used to accumulate resource
   information at the MRB but as it is co-hosted on the Application
   Server, the "Media Server Consumer Interface" has collapsed.  It
   might still exist within the Application Server/MRB interaction but
   this is an implementation issue.  This type of deployment suits a
   single Application Server environment but it should be noted that a
   "Media Server Consumer Interface" could then be offered from the
   hybrid if required.

   In a similar manner, the Media Server could also act as a hybrid for
   the deployment cluster, as illustrated in Figure 7.

                  Figure 7: Hybrid Query MRB - MS Hosted

   This time the MRB has collapsed and is co-hosted by the Media Server.
   The "Media Server Consumer Interface" is still available to the
   Application Servers (1) to query Media Server resources.  This time
   the "Media Server Publishing Interface" has collapsed onto the Media
   Server.  It might still exist within the Media Server/MRB interaction
   but this is an implementation issue.  This type of deployment suits a
   single Media Server environment but it should be noted that a "Media
   Server Publishing Interface" could then be offered from the hybrid if
   required.

4.2.  In-Line MRB

   The "In-line" MRB is architecturally different from the "Query" model
   that was discussed in the previous section.  The Concept of a "Media
   Server Consumer Interface" disappears.  The client of the MRB simply
   uses the signalling to offload the decision making process - this
   applies to both media server Control and Media Dialogs.  This type of
   deployment is illustrated in Figure 8.

                           Figure 8: In-line MRB

   The Media Servers still use the 'Media Server Publishing Interface'
   to convey capabilities and resources to the MRB - as illustrated by
   (1).  The media server Control and Media dialogs are blindly sent to
   the MRB (2) which then selects an appropriate Media Server (3).  The
   result of such an architecture is that the decision is left entirely
   to the MRB and the Application Server has no input into the selection
   process.  This is the opposite to the "Query" model which provided
   information that would help influence the Media Server decision
   making process on the application server.  As a by-product of this
   decision shift, a lot more emphasis is placed on the intelligence of
   the MRB to interpret the required capabilities of the request.  It
   will actually have to inspect both the SIP signalling and the media
   server control protocol PDUs for the purpose of Media Server
   selection.  This includes, for example, looking for explicit
   capabilities in the signalling and session details such as media
   types, codecs and bandwidth requirements.  Ultimately the decision
   making and policy enforcement is removed from the Application Server
   and shifted to the MRB logical entity.

5.  Interface Discussion

   As discussed in previous sections in this document, the intention is
   to provide a toolkit for a variety of deployment architectures where
   media resource brokering can take place.  As a result, two main
   interfaces are required to support the differing requirements.  The
   two interfaces are described in the remainder of this section and
   have been named the 'Media Server Resource Publishing' and Media
   Server Resource Consumer' interfaces.  These two interfaces have
   extremely differing responsibilities and usages which is reflected in
   the choice of solutions.

   It is beyond the scope of this document to define exactly how to
   construct an MRB.  This includes interpreting the data for the Media
   Service Consumer interface supplied by the Media Serer Publishing
   interface.  It is, however, important that the two interfaces are
   complimentary so that development of appropriate MRB functionality is
   supported.

5.1.  Media Server Resource Publishing Interface

   The Media Server Resource Publishing interface is responsible for
   providing an MRB with appropriate Media Server resource information.
   It is generally accepted that this interface provides both general
   and specific details related to Media Server resources.  This
   information needs to be conveyed using an industry standard mechanism
   to provide increased levels of adoption and interoperability.  The
   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) will provide the basis for
   the interface.

   An overview of the documents of the Internet-Standard Management
   Framework is provided in section 7 of RFC 3410 [RFC3410].  This
   interface will provide Management Information Base (MIB) objects that
   are accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects contained within the Media Server publishing interface are
   defined using Structure of Management Information (SMI).  The Media
   Server publishing MIB will be compliant to SMIv2, which is defined in
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and RFC 2580 [RFC2578].

   EDITORS NOTE: Need to map resources to MIB and define appropriately.
   The following information has been taken from feedback from the
   community.  Please comment on existing entires and any other that you
   feel should be added to the list.  Note that some of the publishing
   topics would naturally be included in the 'AS Request to MRB' section
   that follows.  At this stage it is only included in one place for
   further discussion:

   o  Active RTP sessions (including codec information).  For example,
      10 G711 RTP sessions, 3 H.264 sessions.

   o  Active Mixers.  For example F4: (2 G711, 3 G729), (second mixer
      and the codecs), (third mixer), ...).

   o  Non Active sessions - so sessions available on this MS (based on
      codecs supported).  For example, 80 G711 RTP session,120 G729
      sessions,30 H.264 sessions.

   o  MS Uptime.

   o  Codecs/media supported (could just be bundled with above 'Non
      Active Sessions'.

   o  In addition to the generic media processing related information,
      there are definitely cases where the AS will want to specify
      application-level criteria, which will be application-specific,
      and difficult to enumerate in advance.  So I'm thinking we need a
      way to express arbitrary application specific criteria in addition
      to the generic media processing criteria.  For example, the AS may
      need an MS which is capable of prompting and performing speech
      recognition in Swahili.  Or, an MS which has the capability to
      invoke some application-specific functionality.

   o  File formats supported for announcement.  E.g.: MP3, WAW etc...
      May be this information is enough to determine announcement format
      supported i.e. audio or video.

   o  Maximum duration for an announcement.  Media servers can have
      restrictions on memory to play the announcements for very long
      durations.

   o  Variable announcements.  Where the substitution variable can be
      time, date, cost etc.

   o  DTMF detection and generation support.

   o  Types of mixing (conference supported) audio, video.

   o  Supported tone types in the Media Server.  Different countries may
      have different characteristics for the same tone.  So the tone
      characteristics can be configured in the media server or can be
      downloaded.  Capability to play the tone in both directions may be
      required for conferencing applications.  E.g. playing a tone when
      a new participant joins in the conference.  The tone needs to be
      played towards the existing participants and also towards the new
      participant.

   o  Audio RTSP streaming.  Audio conferencing.  Audio record.  Audio
      transcoding.

   o  ASR/TTS usage.  ASR grammar complexity.  Language complexity.

   o  Speaker verification/recognition.

   o  Music recognition.

   o  Audio transformation (mask voice, raise tone, add echo, effects
      etc.)

   o  VoiceXML dialogs and their complexity.

   o  Encryption of audio/video media streams.

   o  Video transcoding.

   o  Dynamic or static video frame rate, bit rate or picture size
      adaptation per multimedia stream.

   o  Video record.

   o  Video RTSP streaming.

   o  Media insertion (audio, video, text, picture, logo, avatar or
      background/ambiance) in a multimedia stream.

   o  Video mixing.

   o  Video broadcasting.

   o  Face/shape/image detection/removal.

5.2.  Media Service Resource Consumer Interface

   The Media Server Consumer interface provides the ability for clients
   of an MRB, such as Application Servers, to request an appropriate
   Media Server to satisfy specific criteria.  The interface allows a
   client to pass detailed meta-information to the MRB to help select an
   appropriate Media Server.  The MRB is then able to make and informed
   decision and provide the client with an appropriate media server
   resource.

   The interface is therefore based on a client-server Remote Procedure
   Call mechanism, with the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
   [W3C.REC-soap12-part1-20030624] [W3C.REC-soap12-part2-20030624] used
   to carry out the interactions.  The data structures will be defined
