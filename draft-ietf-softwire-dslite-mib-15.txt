1.  Introduction

   Dual-Stack Lite [RFC6333] is a solution to offer both IPv4 and IPv6
   connectivity to customers crossing an IPv6 only infrastructure.  One
   of its key components is an IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel, which is used to
   provide IPv4 connectivity across a service provider's IPv6 network.
   Another key component is a carrier-grade IPv4-IPv4 Network Address
   Translation (NAT) to share service provider IPv4 addresses among
   customers.

   This document defines a portion of the Management Information Base
   (MIB) for using with network management protocols in the Internet
   community.  This MIB module may be used for configuration and
   monitoring Address Family Transition Routers (AFTRs) in a Dual-Stack
   Lite scenario.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119] when they appear in ALL CAPS.  When these words are not in
   ALL CAPS (such as "should" or "Should"), they have their usual
   English meanings, and are not to be interpreted as [RFC2119] key
   words.

3.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in
   [RFC2578], [RFC2579] and [RFC2580].

4.  Relationship to the IF-MIB

   The Interfaces MIB [RFC2863] defines generic managed objects for
   managing interfaces.  Each logical interface (physical or virtual)
   has an ifEntry.  Tunnels are handled by creating a logical interface
   (ifEntry) for each tunnel.  Each DS-Lite tunnel endpoint also acts as
   a virtual interface, which has a corresponding entry in the IP Tunnel
   MIB and Interface MIB.  Those corresponding entries are indexed by
   ifIndex.

   The ifOperStatus in ifTable is used to represent whether the DS-Lite
   tunnel function has been triggered.  The ifInUcastPkts defined in
   ifTable will represent the number of IPv4 packets that have been
   encapsulated into IPv6 packets sent to a B4.  The ifOutUcastPkts
   defined in ifTable contains the number of IPv6 packets that can be
   decapsulated to IPv4 in the virtual interface.  Also, the IF-MIB
   defines ifMtu for the MTU of this tunnel interface, so DS-Lite MIB
   does not need to define the MTU for the tunnel.

5.  Difference from the IP tunnel MIB and NATV2-MIB

   The key technologies for DS-Lite are IP in IP (IPv4-in-IPv6) tunnels
   and NAT (IPv4 to IPv4 translation).

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-15       January 2016


   Notes: According to section 5.2 of [RFC6333], DS-Lite only defines
   IPv4 in IPv6 tunnels at this moment, but other types of encapsulation
   could be defined in the future.  So this DS-Lite MIB only supports IP
   in IP encapsulation.  If another RFC defines other tunnel types in
   the future, this DS-Lite MIB will be updated then.

   The NATV2-MIB [RFC7659] is designed to carry translation from any
   address family to any address family, therefore it supports IPv4 to
   IPv4 translation.

   The IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087] is designed for managing tunnels of any
   type over IPv4 and IPv6 networks, therefore it has already supports
   IP in IP tunnels.  But in a DS-Lite scenario, the tunnel type is
   point-to-multipoint IP in IP tunnels.  The direct(2) defined in IP
   Tunnel MIB only supports point-to-point tunnel.  So it needs to
   define a new tunnel type for DS-Lite.

   However, the NATV2-MIB and IP Tunnel MIB together are not sufficient
   to support DS-Lite.  This document describes the specific features
   for DS-Lite MIB, as below.

   In the DS-Lite scenario, the Address Family Transition Router (AFTR)
   is not only the tunnel end concentrator, but also an IPv4-to-IPv4
   NAT.  So as defined in [RFC6333], when the IPv4 packets come back
   from the Internet to the AFTR, it knows how to reconstruct the IPv6
   encapsulation by doing a reverse lookup in the extended IPv4 NAT
   binding table (section 6.6 of [RFC6333]).  The NAT binding table in
   the AFTR is extended to include the IPv6 address of the tunnel
   initiator.  However, the NAT binding information defined in NATV2-MIB
   as natv2PortMapTable is indexed by the NAT instance, protocol, and
   external realm and address.  Because the tunnelIfTable defined in the
   TUNNEL-MIB [RFC4087] is indexed by the ifIndex, the DS-Lite-MIB needs
   to define the tunnel objects to extend the NAT binding entry by
   interface.  Therefore, a combined MIB is necessary.

   An implementation of the IP Tunnel MIB is required for DS-Lite.  As
   the tunnel is not point-to-point in DS-Lite, it needs to define a new
   tunnel type for DS-Lite.  And the tunnelIfEncapsMethod in the
   tunnelIfEntry should be set to dsLite ("xx"), and a corresponding
   entry in the DS-Lite module will exist for every tunnelIfEntry with
   this tunnelIfEncapsMethod.  The tunnelIfRemoteInetAddress must be set
   to "::".

6.  Structure of the MIB Module

   The DS-Lite MIB provides a way to monitor and manage the devices
   (AFTRs) in a DS-Lite scenario through SNMP.

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-15       January 2016


   The DS-Lite MIB is configurable on a per-interface basis.  It depends
   on several parts of the IF-MIB [RFC2863], IP Tunnel MIB [RFC4087],
   and NATV2-MIB [RFC7659].

6.1.  The Object Group

   This group defines objects that are needed for DS-Lite MIB.

6.1.1.  The dsliteTunnel Subtree

   The dsliteTunnel subtree describes managed objects used for managing
   tunnels in the DS-Lite scenario.  Because the
   tunnelInetConfigLocalAddress and tunnelInetConfigRemoteAddress
   defined in the IP Tunnel MIB are not readable, a few new objects are
   defined in DS-Lite MIB.

6.1.2.  The dsliteNAT Subtree

   The dsliteNAT subtree describes managed objects used for
   configuration as well as monitoring of an AFTR which is capable of a
   NAT function.  Because the NATV2-MIB supports the NAT management
   function in DS-Lite, we may reuse it in DS-Lite MIB.  The dsliteNAT
   subtree also provides the mapping information between the tunnel
   entry (dsliteTunnelEntry) and the NAT entry (dsliteNATBindEntry) by
   adding the IPv6 address of the B4 to the natv2PortMapEntry in the
   NATV2-MIB.

6.1.3.  The dsliteInfo Subtree

   The dsliteInfo subtree provides statistical information for DS-Lite.

6.2.  The Notification Group

   This group defines some notification objects for a DS-Lite scenario.

6.3.  The Conformance Group

   The dsliteConformance subtree provides conformance information of MIB
   objects.

7.  MIB modules required for IMPORTS

   This MIB module IMPORTs objects from [RFC2578], [RFC2580], [RFC2863],
   [RFC3411], [RFC4001] and [RFC7659].

9.  Security Considerations

   There are three objects defined in this MIB module with a MAX-ACCESS
   clause of read-write.  Such objects may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  The support for SET
   operations in a non-secure environment without proper protection
   opens devices to attack.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Notification thresholds: An attacker setting an arbitrarily low
   threshold can cause many useless notifications to be generated.
   Setting an arbitrarily high threshold can effectively disable
   notifications, which could be used to hide another attack.

      dsliteAFTRAlarmConnectNumber

      dsliteAFTRAlarmSessionNumber

      dsliteAFTRAlarmPortNumber

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Objects that reveal host identities: Various objects can reveal the
   identity of private hosts that are engaged in a session with external
   end nodes.  A curious outsider could monitor these to assess the
   number of private hosts being supported by the AFTR device.  Further,
   a disgruntled former employee of an enterprise could use the
   information to break into specific private hosts by intercepting the
   existing sessions or originating new sessions into the host.  If
   nothing else, unauthorized monitoring of these objects will violate
   individual subscribers' privacy.

      entries in dsliteNATBindTable

Internet-Draft      draft-ietf-softwire-dslite-mib-15       January 2016


   Unauthorized read access to the dsliteTunnelTable would reveal
   information about the tunnel topology.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPSec),
   there is no control as to who on the secure network is allowed to
   access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects in this
   MIB module.

   Implementations SHOULD provide the security features described by the
   SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410]), and implementations claiming
   compliance to the SNMPv3 standard MUST include full support for
   authentication and privacy via the User-based Security Model (USM)
   [RFC3414] with the AES cipher algorithm [RFC3826].  Implementations
   MAY also provide support for the Transport Security Model (TSM)
   [RFC5591] in combination with a secure transport such as SSH
   [RFC5592] or TLS/DTLS [RFC6353].

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
   OBJECT IDENTIFIER value recorded in the SMI Numbers registry, and the
   following IANA-assigned tunnelType value recorded in the
   IANAtunnelType-MIB registry:

         Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
         ----------        -----------------------
         DSLite-MIB         { mib-2 XXX }

         IANAtunnelType ::= TEXTUAL-CONVENTION

                    SYNTAX     INTEGER {

                               dsLite ("XX")        -- dslite tunnel

                               }
