               Custom Subscription to Event Notifications
             draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications-01

Abstract

   This document defines capabilities and operations for the customized
   establishment of subscriptions upon a publisher's event streams.
   Also defined are delivery mechanisms for instances of the resulting
   events.  Effectively this allows a subscriber to request and receive
   a continuous, custom influx of publisher generated information.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines capabilities and operations for the customized
   establishment of subscriptions upon system generated event streams.
   Also defined are asynchronous delivery mechanisms, where the
   resulting event instances are placed within notification messages and
   sent to targeted receivers.  Effectively this enables a "Subscribe
   then Publish" capability where the customized information needs of
   each target receiver are understood by the publisher before events
   are marshalled and pushed.  The receiver then gets a continuous,
   custom influx of publisher generated events.

   While the functionality defined in this document is transport-
   agnostic, subscription control plane operations bindings exist for
   both NETCONF [RFC6241] and RESTCONF [RFC8040].  In addition, bindings
   for the pushed event instances have been defined for protocols such
   as NETCONF and HTTP2 [RFC7540].  For specifics on these bindings see
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notif]) and
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif].

   The capabilities and operations defined in this document with
   implemented in conjunction with
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notif] are intended to obsolete
   [RFC5277].

1.1.  Motivation

   There are various [RFC5277] limitations, many of which have been
   exposed in [RFC7923] which needed to be solved.  Key capabilities
   supported by this document include:

   o  multiple subscriptions on a single transport session

   o  support for dynamic and statically configured subscriptions

   o  modification of an existing subscription

   o  operational counters and instrumentation

   o  negotiation of subscription parameters

   o  promise theory based interaction model

   o  state change notifications (e.g., publisher driven suspension,
      parameter modification)

   o  independence from transport protocol

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   Configured subscription: A subscription installed via a configuration
   interface which persists across reboots.

   Dynamic subscription: A subscription agreed between subscriber and
   publisher created via RPC subscription state signaling messages.

   Event: An occurrence of something that may be of interest. (e.g., a
   configuration change, a fault, a change in status, crossing a
   threshold, or an external input to the system.)

   Event notification: A set of information intended for a Receiver
   indicating that one or more Event(s) have occurred.  Details of the
   Event(s) may be included within the Notification.

   Filter: Evaluation criteria, which may be applied against a targeted
   set of objects/events in a subscription.  Information traverses the
   filter only if specified filter criteria are met.

   NACM: NETCONF Access Control Model.

   Publisher: An entity responsible for streaming event notifications
   per the terms of a Subscriptions

   Receiver: A target to which a publisher pushes event notifications.
   For dynamic subscriptions, the receiver and subscriber will often be
   the same entity.

   Stream (also referred to as "event stream"): A continuous ordered set
   of events grouped under an explicit criteria.

   Subscriber: An entity able to request and negotiate a contract for
   the receipt of event notifications from a publisher.

   Subscription: A contract with a publisher, stipulating which
   information receiver(s) wishes to have pushed from the publisher
   without the need for further solicitation.

1.3.  Solution Overview

   This document describes a transport protocol-agnostic mechanisms for
   subscribing to and receiving event notifications from an event
   publisher.  Two types of subscriptions are supported:

   1.  Dynamic subscriptions, where a subscriber initiates a
       subscription negotiation with a publisher via RPC.  If the
       publisher wants to serve this request, it will accept it, and
       then start pushing event notifications.  If the publisher does
       not wish to serve it as requested, then an error response is
       returned.  This response may include hints at subscription
       parameters which would have been accepted.

   2.  Configured subscriptions, which allows the managing subscriptions
       via a configuration interface so that a publisher can send event
       notifications to configured receiver(s).  Support for this
       capability is optional.

   Additional characteristics differentiating configured from dynamic
   subscriptions include:

   o  The lifetime of a dynamic subscription is limited by the lifetime
      of the subscriber session used to establish it.  Typically loss of
      the transport session tears down any dependent dynamic
      subscriptions.  The lifetime of a configured subscription is
      driven by relevent configuration being present on the running
      configuration.  This implies configured subscriptions persist
      across reboots, and persists even when transport is unavailable.

   o  Configured subscriptions can be modified by any configuration
      client with write rights on the configuration of the subscription.
      Dynamic subscriptions can only be modified via an RPC request made
      upon the original subscribing transport session.

   Note that there is no mixing-and-matching of dynamic and configured
   subscriptions.  Specifically, a configured subscription cannot be
   modified or deleted using RPC.  Similarly, a subscription established
   via RPC cannot be modified through configuration operations.

   The publisher may decide to terminate a dynamic subscription at any
   time.  Similarly, it may decide to temporarily suspend the sending of
   event notifications for either configured or dynamic subscriptions.
   Such termination or suspension may be driven by the publisher running

   out of resources to serve the subscription, or by internal errors on
   the publisher.

2.  Solution

2.1.  Event Streams

   An event stream is a named entity on a publisher which exposes a
   continuously updating set of events.  Each event stream is available
   for subscription.  It is out of the scope of this document to
   identify a) how streams are defined, b) how events are defined/
   generated, and c) how events are assigned to streams.

   There are two standardized event streams within this document:
   NETCONF and SYSLOG.  The NETCONF event stream contains all NETCONF
   XML event information supported by the publisher, except for where it
   has been explicitly indicated that this the event must be excluded
   from the NETCONF stream.  The SYSLOG event stream mirrors the
   discrete set entries which are concurrently being placed into a
   device's local Syslog.  Beyond these two, additional streams can be
   added via model augmentation.

   As events are raised by a system, they may be assigned to one or more
   streams.  The event is distributed to receivers where: (1) a
   subscription includes the identified stream, and (2) subscription
   filtering allows the event to traverse.

   If access control permissions are in use to secure publisher content,
   then for notifications to be sent to a receiver, that receiver must
   be allowed access to the stream.  If permissions change during the
   lifecycle of the of a subscription, then events must be sent or
   restricted accordingly.  This can be be done by re-establishing a
   subscription with the updated permissions, or by seamlessly updating
   the permissions of an existing subscription.

2.2.  Filters

   A publisher implementation MUST support the ability to perform
   filtering of notification records.  Two filtering syntaxes supported
   are [XPATH] and [RFC6241].  Events which evaluate to "true" as a
   result of the evaluation by the filter must traverse the filter in
   their entirety.  A subset of information is never stripped from
   within the event.

2.3.  Subscription State Model at the Publisher

   Below is the state machine of a subscription for the publisher for a
   dyanmic subscription.  It is important to note that such a
   subscription doesn't exist at the publisher until it is accepted and
   made active.  The mere request by a subscriber to establish a
   subscription is insufficient for that asserted subscription to be
   externally visible via this state machine.

                       | start |
                       '-------'
                           |
                        establish
                           |
                           |   .----------modify------------.
                           v   v                            '

          .--------. |           |-----suspend------->|           |
        modify      '|  active   |                    | suspended |
          '--------->|           |<----resume---------|           |
                     '-----------'                    '-----------'
                           |                                |
                      delete/kill                      delete/kill
                           |                                |
                           v                                |
                       .-------.                            |
                       |  end  |<---------------------------'
                       '-------'

                Figure 1: Subscription states at publisher

   Of interest in this state machine are the following:

   o  Successful establish or modify RPCs put the subscription into an
      active state.

   o  Failed modify RPCs will leave the subscription in its previous
      state, with no visible change to any streaming updates.

   o  A delete or kill RPC will end the subscription.

   o  Suspend and resume state changes are driven by internal process
      and prioritization.  There are no external controls over suspend
      and resume.

   An equivalent state machine exists for configured subscriptions.
   However the transition between states is via configuration operations
   rather than via RPC.

   The top-level decompositions of data model are as follows:

   o  "Streams" contains a list of event streams that are supported by
      the publisher and against which subscription is allowed.

   o  "Filters" contains a configurable list of filters that can be
      applied to a subscription.  This allows users to reference an
      existing filter definition as an alternative to defining a filter
      inline for each subscription.

   o  "Subscription-config" contains the configuration of configured
      subscriptions.  The parameters of each configured subscription are
      a superset of the parameters of a dynamic subscription and use the
      same groupings.  In addition, the configured subscriptions must
      also specify intended receivers and may specify the push source
      from which to send the stream of notification messages.

   o  "Subscriptions" contains a list of all subscriptions on a
      publisher, both configured and dynamic.  It can be used to
      retrieve information about the subscriptions which a publisher is
      serving.

   The data model also contains a number of notifications that allow a
   publisher to signal information about a subscription.  Finally, the
   data model contains a number of RPC definitions that are used to
   manage dynamic subscriptions.

4.  Dynamic Subscriptions

   Dynamic subscriptions are managed via RPC.

4.1.  Establishing a Subscription

   The <establish-subscription> operation allows a subscriber to request
   the creation of a subscription via RPC.

   The input parameters of the operation are:

   o  A filter which identifies what is being subscribed to, as well as
      what should be included (or not) in the pushed results.

   o  A stream which identifies the domain of events against which the
      subscription is applied.

   o  The desired encoding for the returned events.  By default, updates
      are encoded using XML.  Other encodings may be supported, such as
      JSON.

   o  An optional stop time for the subscription.

   o  An optional start time which indicates that this subscription is
      requesting a replay push of events previously generated.

   If the publisher cannot satisfy the <establish-subscription> request,
   it sends a negative <subscription-result> element.  If the subscriber
   has no authorization to establish the subscription, the
   <subscription-result> indicates an authorization error.  Optionally,
   the <subscription-result> may include one or more hints on
   alternative input parameters and value which would have resulted in
   an accepted subscription.

   Subscription requests must fail if a filter with invalid syntax is
   provided or if the name of a non-existent stream is provided.

4.1.1.  Replay Subscription

   Only viable for dynamic subscriptions made on event streams, if the
   replay feature is supported, a subscription may request that
   previously generated events be sent.  These would then be followed by
   events generated after the subscription is established.

   The presence of a start time is the indicator that there is requested
   replay for this subscription.  The start time must be earlier than
   the current time.  If the start time points earlier than the
   maintained history of Publisher's event buffer, then the subscription



Voit, et al.            Expires October 16, 2017               [Page 12]

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


   must be rejected.  In this case the error response to the <establish-
   subscription> request should include a start time supportable by the
   Publisher.

4.2.  Modifying a Subscription

   The <modify-subscription> operation permits changing the terms of an
   existing dynamic subscription previously established on that
   transport session.  Subscriptions created by configuration operations
   cannot be modified via this RPC.  Dynamic subscriptions can be
   modified one or multiple times.  If the publisher accepts the
   requested modifications, it immediately starts sending events based
   on the new terms, completely ignoring the previous ones.  If the
   publisher rejects the request, the subscription remains as prior to
   the request.  That is, the request has no impact whatsoever.  The
   contents of a such a rejected modification may include one or more
   hints on alternative input parameters and value which would have
   resulted in a successfully modified subscription.

   Dynamic subscriptions established via RPC can only be modified (or
   deleted) via RPC using the same transport session used to establish
   that subscription.

4.3.  Deleting a Subscription

   The <delete-subscription> operation permits canceling an existing
   subscription previously established on that transport session.  If
   the publisher accepts the request, it immediately stops sending
   events for the subscription.  If the publisher rejects the request,
   all subscriptions remain as prior to the request.  That is, the
   request has no impact whatsoever.

   Subscriptions established via RPC can only be deleted via RPC using
   the same transport session used for subscription establishment.
   Configured subscriptions cannot be deleted using RPCs.  Instead,
   configured subscriptions are deleted as part of regular configuration
   operations.  Publishers MUST reject any RPC attempt to delete
   configured subscriptions.

4.4.  Killing a Subscription

   The <kill-subscription> operation permits an operator to end any
   dynamic subscription.  The publisher must accept the request for any
   dynamic subscription, and immediately stop sending events.

   Configured subscriptions cannot be kill using this RPC.  Instead,
   configured subscriptions are deleted as part of regular configuration

   operations.  Publishers MUST reject any RPC attempt to kill a
   configured subscription.

5.  Configured Subscriptions

   A configured subscription is a subscription installed via a
   configuration interface.

   Configured subscriptions persist across reboots, and persist even
   when transport is unavailable.

   Configured subscriptions can be modified by any configuration client
   with write permissions for the configuration of the subscription.
   Subscriptions can be modified or terminated via the configuration
   interface at any point of their lifetime.

   Supporting configured subscriptions is optional and advertised using
   the "configured-subscriptions" feature.

   In addition to subscription parameters that apply to dynamic
   subscriptions, the following additional parameters apply to
   configured subscriptions:

   o  One or more receiver IP addresses (and corresponding
      ports)intended as the destination for push updates for each
      subscription.  In addition, the transport protocol for each
      destination may be defined.

   o  Optional parameters to identify an egress interface or IP address
      / VRF where a subscription updates should be pushed from the
      publisher.  If not included, push updates will go off a default
      interface for the device.

5.1.  Establishing a Configured Subscription

   Configured subscriptions are established using configuration
   operations against the top-level subtree subscription-config.  There
   are two key differences between RPC and <edit-config> RPC operations
   for subscription establishment.  Firstly, <edit-config> operations
   install a subscription without question, while RPCs may support
   negotiation and rejection of requests.  Secondly, while RPCs mandate
   that the subscriber establishing the subscription is the only
   receiver of the notifications, <edit-config> operations permit
   specifying receivers independent of any tracked subscriber.
   Immediately after a subscription is successfully established, the
   publisher sends to any newly active receivers a control-plane
   notification stating the subscription has been established
   (subscription-started).



Voit, et al.            Expires October 16, 2017               [Page 14]

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


   Because there is no explicit association with an existing transport
   session, <edit-config> operations require additional parameters to
   indicate the receivers of the notifications and possibly the source
   of the notifications such as a specific egress interface.

   For example at subscription establishment if NETCONF transport is
   being used, a client may send:

   <rpc message-id="101"
          xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
          xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
       <edit-config>
           <target>
               <running/>
           </target>
           <subscription-config
               xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:2.0">
               <subscription>
                   <subscription-id>
                       1922
                   </subscription-id>
                   <stream>
                       foo
                   </stream>
                   <receiver>
                       <address>
                           1.2.3.4
                       </address>
                       <port>
                           1234
                       </port>
                   </receiver>
               </subscription>
           </subscription-config>
       </edit-config>
   </rpc>

          Figure 2: Configured subscription creation via NETCONF

   if the request is accepted, the publisher would reply:

   <rpc-reply message-id="101"
             xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
          <ok/>
   </rpc-reply>

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


   if the request is not accepted because the publisher cannot serve it,
   the publisher may reply:

   <rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
       <rpc-error>
           <error-type>application</error-type>
           <error-tag>resource-denied</error-tag>
           <error-severity>error</error-severity>
           <error-message xml:lang="en">
               Temporarily the publisher cannot serve this
               subscription due to the current workload.
           </error-message>
       </rpc-error>
   </rpc-reply>

                                 creation

5.2.  Modifying a Configured Subscription

   Configured subscriptions can be modified using configuration
   operations against the top-level subtree subscription-config.

   Immediately after a subscription is successfully modified, the
   publisher sends to the existing receivers a control-plane
   notification stating the subscription has been modified (i.e.,
   subscription-modified).

   If the modification involved adding and/or removing receivers, those
   modified receivers are sent control-plane notifications, indicating
   they have been added (i.e, subscription-started to a specific
   receiver) or removed (i.e., subscription-terminated to a specific
   receiver.)

5.3.  Deleting a Configured Subscription

   Subscriptions can be deleted using configuration operations against
   the top-level subtree subscription-config.  For example, in RESTCONF:

   DELETE /subscription-config/subscription=1922 HTTP/1.1
   Host: example.com

   HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
   Date: Sun, 24 Jul 2016 11:23:40 GMT
   Server: example-server

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


   Immediately after a subscription is successfully deleted, the
   publisher sends to all receivers of that subscription a control-plane
   notification stating the subscription has been terminated
   (subscription-terminated).

6.  Event (Data Plane) Notifications

   Once a subscription has been set up, the publisher streams
   (asynchronously) notifications per the terms of the subscription.  We
   refer to these as event notifications.  For dynamic subscriptions set
   up via RPC operations, event notifications are sent over the session
   used to establish the subscription.  For configured subscriptions,
   event notifications are sent over the specified connections.

   An event notification is sent to a receiver when something of
   interest occurs which is able to traverse all specified filtering and
   access control criteria.  At a minimum this event notification must
   include:

   o  a subscription-id element of type uint32 which corresponds to the
      responsible subscription in the Publisher.

   o  a timestamp indicating when event was identified and recorded by
      the event source.  This timestamp must support the indication of
      time zone.  The default timestamp is the eventTime element of type
      dateTime and compliant to [RFC3339].  Additional timestamp
      elements and formats are outside the scope of this document.

   o  the event notification content tagged and provided by a source in
      the publisher.

   Additional header and event bundling capabilities not defined in this
   document may transparently be included within the event notification.

   The following is an example of a compliant event notification.  This
   example extending the example within [RFC7950] section 7.16.3 to
   include the mandatory information described above:

       <subscription-id>500</subscription-id>

       </link-failure>
   </notification>

                     Figure 6: Data plane notification

   While this extended [RFC7950] section 7.16 notification provides a
   valid method of encapsulating subscribed notifications, other
   transport encapsulation methods are also viable.  Improvements may be
   achieved in some implementations in the following ways:

   o  transport efficiency may be gained by allowing the encapsulation
      and bundled push of multiple events within the same event
      notification.

   o  identifiers to designate the current and previous event
      notification can be used to discover duplicated and dropped
      notifications

   o  additional header types can be used to pass relevant metadata.

   o  a signature or hash can be included to verify the efficacy of the
      Publisher

   This is being explored in NETMOD Notifications 2.0
   [I-D.voit-notifications2].

7.  Subscription State Notifications

   In addition to data plane notifications, a publisher may send
   subscription state notifications to indicate to receivers that an
   event related to the subscription management has occurred.

   Subscription state notifications are unlike other notifications in
   that they are not general-purpose notifications.  They cannot be
   filtered out, and they are delivered only to directly impacted
   receiver(s) of a subscription.  The definition of subscription state
   notifications is distinct from other notifications by making use of a
   YANG extension tagging them as subscription state notification.





Voit, et al.            Expires October 16, 2017               [Page 18]

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


   Subscription state notifications include indications that a replay of
   events has been completed, that a subscription is done because an end
   time has been reached, and that a subscription has started, been
   modified, been terminated, or been suspended.  They are described in
   the following subsections.

7.1.  subscription-started

   This notification indicates that a configured subscription has
   started and data updates are beginning to be sent.  This notification
   includes the parameters of the subscription, except for the
   receiver(s) addressing information and push-source information.  Note
   that for RPC-based subscriptions, no such notifications are sent.

7.2.  subscription-modified

   This notification indicates that a configured subscription has been
   modified successfully.  This notification includes the parameters of
   the subscription, except for the receiver(s) addressing information
   and push-source information.  Note that for RPC-based subscriptions,
   no such notifications are sent.

7.3.  subscription-terminated

   This notification indicates that a subscription has been terminated
   by the publisher.  The notification includes the reason for the
   termination.  The publisher may decide to terminate a subscription
   when it is running out of resources for serving it, an internal error
   occurs, etc.  Publisher-driven terminations are notified to all
   receivers.  The management plane can also terminate configured
   subscriptions using configuration operations.

   Subscribers can terminate via RPC subscriptions established via a
   delete-subscription RPC.  In such cases, no subscription-terminated
   notifications are sent.  However if a kill-subscription RPC is sent,
   or some other event results in the end of a susbcription, then there
   must be a notification that the subscription has been ended.

7.4.  subscription-suspended

   This notification indicates that a publisher has suspended a
   subscription.  The notification includes the reason for the
   suspension.  A possible reason is the lack of resources to serve it.
   No further data plane notifications will be sent until the
   subscription resumes.  Suspensions are notified to the subscriber (in
   the case of dynamic subscriptions) and all receivers (in the case of
   configured subscriptions).

7.5.  subscription-resumed

   This notification indicates that a previously suspended subscription
   has been resumed.  Data plane notifications generated in the future
   will be sent after the subscription terms.  Resumptions are notified
   to the subscriber (in the case of dynamic subscriptions) and all
   receivers (in the case of configured subscriptions).

7.6.  notification-complete

   This notification is sent to indicate that a subscription, which
   includes a stop time, has finished passing events.

7.7.  replay-complete

   This notification indicates that all of the events prior to the
   current time have been sent.  This includes new events generated
   since the start of the subscription.  This notification must not be
   sent for any other reason.

   If subscription contains no stop time, or has a stop time which has
   not been reached, then after the replay-complete notification has
   been sent events will be sent in sequence as they arise naturally
   within the system.

8.  Administrative Functions

8.1.  Subscription Monitoring

   Container "subscriptions" in the YANG module below contains the state
   of all subscriptions that are currently active.  This includes
   subscriptions that were established (and have not yet been deleted)
   using RPCs, as well as subscriptions that have been configured as
   part of configuration.  Using the <get> operation with NETCONF, or
   subscribing to this information via [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]
   allows the status of subscriptions to be monitored.

   Each subscription is represented as a list element.  The associated
   information includes an identifier for the subscription, a
   subscription status, as well as the various subscription parameters
   that are in effect.  The subscription status indicates whether the
   subscription is currently active and healthy, or if it is degraded in
   some form.  Leaf "configured-subscription" indicates whether the
   subscription came into being via configuration or via RPC.

   Subscriptions that were established by RPC are removed from the list
   once they expire (reaching stop-time) or when they are terminated.
   Subscriptions that were established by configuration need to be

   deleted from the configuration by a configuration editing operation
   even if the stop time has been passed.

8.2.  Capability Advertisement

   Capabilities are advertised in messages sent by each peer during
   session establishment [RFC6241].  Publishers supporting the features
   in this document must advertise the capability
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:2.0".

   The mechanism defined in this document is identified by
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:2.0".  If a
   subscriber only supports [RFC5277] and not this specification, then
   they will recognize the capability
   "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:notification:1.0" and ignore the
   capability defined in this document.

8.3.  Event Stream Discovery

   A publisher maintains a list of available event streams as
   operational data.  This list contains both standardized and vendor-
   specific event streams.  A client can retrieve this list like any
   other YANG-defined data, for example using the <get> operation when
   using NETCONF.

10.  Considerations

10.1.  Implementation Considerations

   For a deployment including both configured and dynamic subscriptions,
   split subscription identifiers into static and dynamic halves.  That
   way there should not be collisions if the configured subscriptions
   attempt to set a subscription-id which might have already been
   dynamically allocated.

   The <notification> elements are never sent before the transport
   layer, including capabilities exchange, has been established.

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


10.2.  Security Considerations

   For dynamic subscriptions the publisher must authenticate and
   authorize all RPC requests.

   Subscriptions could overload a publisher's CPU.  For this reason, the
   publisher must have the ability to decline a dynamic subscription
   request, and provide the appropriate RPC error response to a
   subscriber should the proposed subscription overly deplete the
   publisher's resources.

   A publisher needs to be able to suspend an existing dynamic or
   configured subscription based on capacity constraints.  When this
   occur, the subscription status must be updated accordingly and the
   receivers notified with subscription state notifications.

   If a malicious or buggy subscriber sends an unexpectedly large number
   of RPCs, this may use up system resources.  In such a situation,
   subscription interactions may be terminated by terminating the
   transport session.

   For both configured and dynamic subscriptions the publisher must
   authenticate and authorize a receiver via some transport level
   mechanism before sending any updates.

   A secure transport is highly recommended and the publisher must
   ensure that the user has sufficient authorization to perform the
   function they are requesting against the specific subset of content
   involved.

   A publisher MUST NOT include any content in a notification for which
   the user has not been authorized.

   With configured subscriptions, one or more publishers could be used
   to overwhelm a receiver.  No push updates should be sent to any
   receiver which doesn't even support subscriptions.  Subscribers that
   do not want pushed data need only terminate or refuse any transport
   sessions from the publisher.

   The NETCONF Authorization Control Model [RFC6536] SHOULD be used to
   control and restrict authorization of subscription configuration.
   This control models permits specifying per-user permissions to
   receive events from specific streams.

   Where NACM is available, the NACM "very-secure" tag should be placed
   on the <kill-subscription> RPC so that only administrators can
   access.

   One subscription id can be used for two or more receivers of the same
   configured subscription.  But due to the possibility of different
   access control permissions per receiver, it should not be assumed
   that each receiver is getting identical updates.

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


A.1.  ietf-netconf-netconf-event-notif

   The [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif] draft augments this subscribed-
   notifications specification by defining NETCONF transport specifics.
   Included are:

   o  bindings for RPC communications and Event Notifications over
      NETCONF.

   o  encoded examples

A.2.  ietf-netconf-restconf-notif

   The [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-notif] draft augments this subscribed-
   notifications specification by defining transport specific guidance
   where some form of HTTP is used underneath.  Included are:

   o  bindings for RPC communications over RESTCONF

   o  bindings for Event Notifications over HTTP2 and HTTP1.1

   o  encoded examples

   o  end-to-end deployment guidance for Call Home and TLS Heartbeat

A.3.  ietf-netconf-yang-push

   The draft [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] builds upon this subscribed-
   notifications specification in order to allow a Publisher to stream
   YANG datastore objects.  In this case, the application of either an
   on-change or periodic triggers upon a YANG Datastore replace the
   system generated events within this document.

   If you wish to subscribe to a YANG datastore rather than a existing
   event stream on a publisher, please refer to this specification.

A.4.  voit-notifications2

   The draft [I-D.voit-notifications2] is not required to implement this
   subscribed-notifications specification.  Instead it defines data
   plane notification elements which improve the delivered experience.
   The following capabilities are specified:

   o  Defines common encapsulation headers objects to support
      functionality such as event severity, message signing, message
      loss discovery, message de-duplication, originating process
      identification.

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


   o  Defines how to bundle multiple event records into a single
      notification message.

   These are the enhanced capabilies alluded to in the Event (Data
   Plane) Notification seciton above.  This draft is not yet adopted by
   the NETCONF WG.

Appendix B.  Issues that are currently being worked and resolved

   (To be removed by RFC editor prior to publication)

   Issue #6: Data plane notifications and layered headers

   How to allow for seamless integration with non-standard encodings and
   transports (like GPB/GRPC).  Specify requirements encoding and
   transport must meet, provide examples.

Appendix C.  Changes between revisions

   (To be removed by RFC editor prior to publication)

   v00 - v01

   o  Security considerations updated

   o  Intro rewrite, as well as scattered text changes

   o  Added Appendix A, to help match this to related drafts in progress

   o  Updated filtering definitions, and filter types in yang file, and
      moved to identities for filter types

   o  Added Syslog as a stream

   o  HTTP2 moved in from YANG-Push as a transport option

   o  Replay made an optional feature for events.  Won't apply to
      datastores

   o  Enabled notification timestamp to have different formats.

   o  Two error codes added.

   v01 5277bis - v00 subscribed notifications

   o  Kill subscription RPC added.

   o  Renamed from 5277bis to Subscribed Notifications.

Internet-Draft          Subscribed Notifications              April 2017


   o  Changed the notification capabilities version from 1.1 to 2.0.

   o  Extracted create-subscription and other elements of RFC5277.

   o  Error conditions added, and made specific in return codes.

   o  Simplified yang model structure for removal of 'basic' grouping.

   o  Added a grouping for items which cannot be statically configured.

   o  Operational counters per receiver.

   o  Subscription-id and filter-id renamed to identifier

   o  Section for replay added.  Replay now cannot be configured.

   o  Control plane notification renamed to subscription state
      notification

   o  Source address: Source-vrf changed to string, default address
      option added

   o  In yang model: 'info' changed to 'policy'

   o  Scattered text clarifications

   v00 - v01 of 5277bis

   o  YANG Model changes.  New groupings for subscription info to allow
      restriction of what is changeable via RPC.  Removed notifications
      for adding and removing receivers of configured subscriptions.

   o  Expanded/renamed definitions from event server to publisher, and
      client to subscriber as applicable.  Updated the definitions to
      include and expand on RFC 5277.

   o  Removal of redundancy with other drafts

   o  Many other clean-ups of wording and terminology
