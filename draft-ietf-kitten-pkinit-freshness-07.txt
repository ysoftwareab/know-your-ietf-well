                          Freshness Extension
                 draft-ietf-kitten-pkinit-freshness-07

Abstract

   This document describes how to further extend the Public Key
   Cryptography for Initial Authentication in Kerberos (PKINIT)
   extension [RFC4556] to exchange an opaque data blob that a KDC can
   validate to ensure that the client is currently in possession of the
   private key during a PKINIT AS exchange.

1.  Introduction

   The Kerberos PKINIT extension [RFC4556] defines two schemes for using
   asymmetric cryptography in a Kerberos preauthenticator.  One uses
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the other depends on public key
   encryption.  The public key encryption scheme is less commonly used
   for two reasons:

   o  Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Support for PKINIT [RFC5349]
      only specified Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement,
      so it cannot be used for public key encryption.

   o  Public key encryption requires certificates with an encryption
      key, that is not deployed on many existing smart cards.

   In the Diffie-Hellman exchange, the client uses its private key only
   to sign the AuthPack structure (specified in Section 3.2.1 of
   [RFC4556]), that is performed before any traffic is sent to the KDC.
   Thus a client can generate requests with future times in the
   PKAuthenticator, and then send those requests at those future times.
   Unless the time is outside the validity period of the client's
   certificate, the KDC will validate the PKAuthenticator and return a
   TGT the client can use without possessing the private key.

Internet-Draft              PKINIT Freshness                    May 2016


   As a result, a client performing PKINIT with the Diffie-Hellman key
   exchange does not prove current possession of the private key being
   used for authentication.  It proves only prior use of that key.
   Ensuring that the client has current possession of the private key
   requires that the signed PKAuthenticator data include information
   that the client could not have predicted.

1.1.  Kerberos message flow using KRB_AS_REQ without pre-authentication

   Today, password-based AS exchanges [RFC4120] often begin with the
   client sending a KRB_AS_REQ without pre-authentication.  When the
   principal requires pre-authentication, the KDC responds with a
   KRB_ERROR containing information needed to complete an AS exchange,
   such as the supported encryption types and salt values.  This message
   flow is illustrated below:

   KDC                     Client

                 <----     AS-REQ without pre-authentication
   KRB-ERROR     ---->

                 <----     AS-REQ
   AS-REP        ---->

                 <----     TGS-REQ
   TGS-REP       ---->

                                 Figure 1

   We can use a similar message flow with PKINIT, allowing the KDC to
   provide a token for the client to include in its KRB_AS_REQ to ensure
   that the PA_PK_AS_REQ [RFC4556] was not pregenerated.

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Message Exchanges

   The following summarizes the message flow with extensions to
   [RFC4120] and [RFC4556] required to support a KDC-provided freshness
   token during the initial request for a ticket:

   1.  The client generates a KRB_AS_REQ as specified in Section 2.9.3
       of [RFC4120] that contains no PA_PK_AS_REQ and includes a
       freshness token request.

Internet-Draft              PKINIT Freshness                    May 2016


   2.  The KDC generates a KRB_ERROR as specified in Section 3.1.3 of
       [RFC4120] providing a freshness token.

   3.  The client receives the error as specified in Section 3.1.4 of
       [RFC4120], extracts the freshness token, and includes it as part
       of the KRB_AS_REQ as specified in [RFC4120] and [RFC4556].

   4.  The KDC receives and validates the KRB_AS_REQ as specified in
       Section 3.2.2 of [RFC4556], then additionally validates the
       freshness token.

   5.  The KDC and client continue as specified in [RFC4120] and
       [RFC4556].

2.1.  Generation of KRB_AS_REQ Message

   The client indicates support of freshness tokens by adding a padata
   element with padata-type PA_AS_FRESHNESS and padata-value of an empty
   octet string.

2.2.  Generation of KRB_ERROR Message

   The KDC will respond with a KRB_ERROR [RFC4120] message with the
   error-code KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_REQUIRED [RFC4120] adding a padata element
   with padata-type PA_AS_FRESHNESS and padata-value of the freshness
   token to the METHOD-DATA object.

2.3.  Generation of KRB_AS_REQ Message

   After the client receives the KRB-ERROR message containing a
   freshness token, it extracts the PA_AS_FRESHNESS padata-value field
   of the PA-DATA structure as an opaque data blob.  The PA_AS_FRESHNESS
   padata-value field of the PA-DATA structure SHALL then be added as an
   opaque blob in the freshnessToken field when the client generates the
   PKAuthenticator specified in Section 4 for the PA_PK_AS_REQ message.
   This ensures that the freshness token value will be included in the
   signed data portion of the KRB_AS_REQ value.

2.4.  Receipt of KRB_AS_REQ Message

   If the realm requires freshness and the PA_PK_AS_REQ message does not
   contain the freshness token, the KDC MUST return a KRB_ERROR
   [RFC4120] message with the error-code KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_FAILED
   [RFC4120] with a padata element with padata-type PA_AS_FRESHNESS and
   padata-value of the freshness token to the METHOD-DATA object.

   When the PA_PK_AS_REQ message contains a freshness token, after
   validating the PA_PK_AS_REQ message normally, the KDC will validate

   the freshnessToken value in the PKAuthenticator in an implementation-
   specific way.  If the freshness token is not valid, the KDC MUST
   return a KRB_ERROR [RFC4120] message with the error-code
   KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_EXPIRED [RFC6113].  The e-data field of the error
   contains a METHOD-DATA object [RFC4120] which specifies a valid
   PA_AS_FRESHNESS padata-value.  Since the freshness tokens are
   validated by KDCs in the same realm, standardizing the contents of
   the freshness token is not a concern for interoperability.

2.5.  Receipt of second KRB_ERROR Message

   If a client receives a KDC_ERR_PREAUTH_EXPIRED KRB_ERROR message that
   includes a freshness token, it SHOULD retry using the new freshness
   token.

3.  PreAuthentication Data Types

          The following are the new PreAuthentication data types:

               +----------------------+-------------------+
               | Padata and Data Type | Padata-type Value |
               +----------------------+-------------------+
               |   PA_AS_FRESHNESS    |        150        |
               +----------------------+-------------------+

4.  Extended PKAuthenticator

Internet-Draft              PKINIT Freshness                    May 2016


   The PKAuthenticator structure specified in Section 3.2.1 of [RFC4556]
   is extended to include a new freshnessToken as follows:

   PKAuthenticator ::= SEQUENCE {
      cusec        [0] INTEGER (0..999999),
      ctime        [1] KerberosTime,
                -- cusec and ctime are used as in [RFC4120], for
                -- replay prevention.
      nonce        [2] INTEGER (0..4294967295),
                -- Chosen randomly;  this nonce does not need to
                -- match with the nonce in the KDC-REQ-BODY.
      paChecksum   [3] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
                -- MUST be present.
                -- Contains the SHA1 checksum, performed over
                -- KDC-REQ-BODY.
      ...,
      freshnessToken     [4] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL,
                -- PA_AS_FRESHNESS padata value as recieved from the
                -- KDC. MUST be present if sent by KDC
      ...
   }

7.  Security Considerations

   The freshness token SHOULD include signing, encrypting or sealing
   data from the KDC to determine authenticity and prevent tampering.

   Freshness tokens serve to guarantee that the client had the key when
   constructing the AS-REQ.  They are not required to be single use
   tokens or bound to specific AS exchanges.  Part of the reason the
   token is opaque is to allow KDC implementers the freedom to add
   additional functionality as long as the "freshness" guarantee
   remains.

8.  Interoperability Considerations

   Since the client treats the KDC-provided data blob as opaque,
   changing the contents will not impact existing clients.  Thus
   extensions to the freshness token do not impact client
   interoperability.

   Clients SHOULD NOT reuse freshness tokens across multiple exchanges.
   There is no guarantee that a KDC will allow a once-valid token to be
   used again.  Thus clients that do not retry with a new freshness
   token may not be compatible with KDCs, depending on how they choose
   to implement freshness validation.

   Since upgrading clients takes time, implementers may consider
   allowing both freshness-token based exchanges and "legacy" exchanges
   without use of freshness tokens.  However, until freshness tokens are
   required by the realm, the existing risks of pre-generated
   PKAuthenticators will remain.
