Abstract

   This document describes a new resource record for DNS.  This record
   may be used to store public keys for use in IPsec systems.

   This record replaces the functionality of the sub-type #1 of the KEY
   Resource Record, which has been proposed to be obsoleted by RFC3445
|  [11].

1. Introduction

1.1 Overview

   The IPSECKEY resource record (RR) is used to publish a public key
   that is to be associated with a Domain Name System (DNS) name.  This
   can be the public key of a host, network, or application (in the case
   of per-port keying).

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
|  document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 [6].

   An IPSECKEY resource record SHOULD be authenticated DNSSEC resource
   record.

   It is expected that there will often be multiple IPSECKEY resource
   records at the same terminal node.  This will be due to the presence
   of multiple gateways and the need to rollover keys.

   This resource record is class independent.

2. Storage formats

   The type number for the IPSECKEY RR is TBD.

2.1 IPSECKEY RDATA format

   The RDATA for an IPSECKEY RR consists of a precedence value, a public
   key (and algorithm type), and an optional gateway address.

       0                   1                   2                   3

      /                          public key                           /

      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-|


2.2 RDATA format - precedence

   This is an 8-bit precedence for this record.  This is interpreted in
   the same way as the PREFERENCE field described in section 3.3.9 of
   RFC1035 [2].

2.3 RDATA format - algorithm type

|  The algorithm field indicates the type of key that is present in the
|  public key field.  A positive number, larger than 0 identifies an
|  algorithm type.  The following values, which have been previously
|  defined by IANA are useful (see RFC2535 [8]).

   A value of 0 indicates that no key is present.

   The following values defined by IANA are useful:

|  3  A DSA key is present, in the format defined in RFC2536 [9]

|  5  A RSA key is present, in the format defined in RFC3110 [10]


|2.4 RDATA format - gateway type

|  The gateway type field indicates the format of the gateway that is
|  stored in the gateway field.



|Richardson             Expires October 27, 2003                [Page 4]

|Internet-Draft                  ipsecrr                      April 2003


|  The following values are defined:

|  0  No gateway is present

|  1  A 4-byte IPv4 address is present

|  2  A 16-byte IPv6 address is present

|  3  A wire-encoded domain-name is present.  The wire-encoded format is
|     self-describing, so the length is implicit.


|2.5 RDATA format - gateway

|  The gateway field indicates a gateway to which an IPsec tunnel may be
|  created in order to reach the entity holding this resource record.

|  There are three formats:

|  A 32-bit IPv4 address is present in the gateway field, as defined in
|  section 3.4.1 of RFC1035 [2].  This is a 32-bit number in network
|  byte order.

|  A 128-bit IPv6 address is present in the gateway field.  The data
|  portion is an IPv6 address as described in section 3.2 of RFC1886
|  [5].  This is a 128-bit number in network byte order.

|  The gateway field is a normal wire-encoded domain name (section 3.3
|  of RFC1035 [2]).

|2.6 RDATA format - RSA public key

   If the algorithm type has the value 5 then public key portion
   contains an RSA public key, encoded as described in secion 2 of
|  RFC3110 [10].

   RFC2065 limited the exponent and modulus to 2552 bits in length, and
   RFC3110 to 4096 bits.  No such limit is specified here for the
   purposes of encoding and decoding.

   The length in octets of the public exponent length is represented as
   one octet if it is in the range of 1 to 255 and by a zero octet
   followed by a two octet unsigned length if it is longer than 255
   bytes.  The public key modulus field is a multiprecision unsigned
   integer.  The length of the modulus can be determined from the
   RDLENGTH and the preceding RDATA fields including the exponent.

   Leading zero bytes are prohibited in the exponent and modulus.

|2.7 RDATA format - DSA public key

   If the algorithm type has the value 3, then public key portion
|  contains an DSA public key, encoded as described in RFC2536 [9].

3. Presentation formats

3.1 Representation of IPSECKEY RRs

   IPSECKEY RRs may appear as lines in a zone data master file.  The
|  precedence, gateway type and algorithm and gateway fields are
|  REQUIRED.  There base64 encoded public key block is OPTIONAL.

   If no gateway is to be indicated, then the root (".") SHOULD be used.

|  IN     IPSECKEY ( precedence gateway-type algorithm
|                    gateway base64-encoded-public-key )

4. Security Considerations

|  This entire memo pertains to the provision of public keying material
|  for use by key management protocols such as ISAKMP/IKE (RFC2407) [7].

|  Implementations of DNS servers and resolvers SHOULD take care to make
|  sure that the keying material is delivered intact to the end
|  application.  The use of DNSSEC to provide end-to-end integrity
|  protection is strongly encouraged.

|  The semantics of this record is outside of the scope of this
|  document, so no advice for users of this information is provided.
|  Any user of this resource record MUST carefully document their trust
|  model, and why the trust model of DNSSEC is appropriate.

5. IANA Considerations

   IANA is asked to assign a resource record type number from the normal
   resource record number space.

   The algorithm field does not require any IANA action, as it is
   inherited from DNS KEY algorithm values.
