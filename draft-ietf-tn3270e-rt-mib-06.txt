Abstract

This memo defines the protocol and the Management Information Base (MIB)
for performing response time data collection on TN3270 and TN3270E
sessions by a TN3270E server.  The response time data collected by a
TN3270E server is structured to support both validation of service level
agreements and performance monitoring of TN3270 and TN3270E Sessions.
This MIB has as a prerequisite the TN3270E-MIB, reference [16].

TN3270E, defined by RFC 2355 [15], refers to the enhancements made to
the Telnet 3270 (TN3270) terminal emulation practices.  Refer to RFC
1041 [14], RFC 854 [12], and RFC 860 [13] for a sample of what is meant
by TN3270 practices.

The specification of this MIB uses the Structure of Management
Information (SMI) for Version 2 of the Simple Network Management
Protocol (refer to RFC1902 [3]).

1.0  Introduction

This document is a product of the TN3270E Working Group.  It defines a
protocol and a MIB module to enable a TN3270E server to collect and keep
track of response time data for both TN3270 and TN3270E clients.  Basis
for implementing this MIB:

o   TN3270E-MIB, Base Definitions of Managed Objects for TN3270E Using
    SMIv2 [16]

o   TN3270E RFCs

o   Telnet Timing Mark Option RFC [13].

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119, reference [19].


2.0  The SNMP Network Management Framework

The SNMP Network Management Framework presently consists of six major
components.  They are:

o   the overall architecture, described in RFC 2271 [7].

o   the SMI, described in RFC 1902 [3], - the mechanisms used for
    describing and naming objects for the purpose of management.

o   the MIB-II, STD 17, RFC 1213 [2], - the core set of managed objects
    for the Internet suite of protocols.

o   the protocol, RFC 1157 [1] and/or RFC 1905 [6] and/or RFC 2272 [8]
    -- the protocol for accessing managed information.

o   the user-based security model defined in RFC 2274 [10].

o   the view-based access control model defined in RFC 2275 [11].

Textual conventions are defined in RFC 1903 [4], and conformance
statements are defined in RFC 1904 [5].  Common applications are defined
in RFC 2273 [9].

The Framework permits new objects to be defined for the purpose of
experimentation and evaluation.

This memo specifies a MIB module that is compliant to the SMIv2.  A MIB
conforming to the SMIv1 can be produced through the appropriate
translation.


3.0  Response Time Collection Methodology

This section explains the methodology and approach used by the MIB
defined by this memo for response time data collection by a TN3270E
server.

3.1  General Response Time Collection

Two primary methods exist for measuring response times in SNA networks:

o   The Systems Network Architecture Management Services (SNA/MS)
    Response Time Monitoring (RTM) function.

o   Timestamping using definite response flows.

This memo defines an approach using definite responses to timestamp the
flows between a client and its TN3270E server, rather than by use of the
RTM method. Extensions to the SNA/MS RTM flow were considered, but this

TN3270E Working Group    Expires December 1998                  [Page 3]

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

approach was deemed unsuitable since not all TN3270E server
implementations have access to their underlying SNA stacks.  The RTM
concepts of keeping response time buckets for service level agreements
and of interval-based response time collection for performance
monitoring are preserved in the MIB module defined in this memo.

As mentioned, this memo focuses on using definite responses to timestamp
the flows between a client and its TN3270E server for generating
performance data.  Use of a definite response flow requires that the
client supports TN3270E with the RESPONSES function negotiated.  The
TN3270 TIMING-MARK option can be used instead of definite response for
supporting TN3270 clients or TN3270E clients that don't support
RESPONSES.  This document focuses first on defining the protocol and
methods for generating performance data using definite responses, and
then describes how the TIMING-MARK option can be used instead of
definite response.

In an SNA network, a transaction between a client Logical Unit (LU) and
a target host in general looks as follows:

        ------------------------------------------------
        |                                              |
        | Client LU                    Target SNA Host |
        |                                              |
        |                               Timestamps     |
        |              request              A          |
        | ----------------------------------------->   |
        |              reply(DR)            B      |   |
        | <---------------------------------------<    |
        | |            +/-RSP               C          |
        | >--------------------------------------->    |
        |                                              |
        | DR:     Definite Response requested          |
        | +/-RSP: Definite Response                    |
        |                                              |
        ------------------------------------------------


This transaction is a simple one, and is being used only to illustrate
how timestamping at a target SNA host can be used to generate response
times.  An IBM redbook [12] provides a more detailed description of
response time collection for a transaction of this type.  Note that for
the purpose of calculating an approximation for network transit time, it
doesn't matter if the response is positive or negative.  Two response
time values are typically calculated:

o   Host Transit Time:    Timestamp B - Timestamp A
o   Network Transit Time: Timestamp C - Timestamp B

Network transit time is an approximation for the amount of time that a
transaction requires to flow across a network, since the response flow
is being substituted for the request flow at the start of the
transaction.  Network transit time, timestamp C - timestamp B, is the
amount of time that the definite response request and its response
required.  Host time, timestamp B - timestamp A, is the actual time that

TN3270E Working Group    Expires December 1998                  [Page 4]

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

the host required to process the transaction.  Experience has shown that
using the response flow to approximate network transit times is useful,
and does correlate well with actual network transit times.

A client SHOULD respond to a definite response request when it completes
processing the transaction.  This is important since it increases the
accuracy of a total response time.  Clients that immediately respond to
a definite response request will be attributed with lower total response
times then those that actually occurred.

The TN3270E-RT-MIB describes a method of collecting performance data
that is not appropriate for printer (LU Type 1 or LU Type 3) sessions;
thus collection of performance data for printer sessions is excluded
from this MIB.  This exclusion of printer sessions is not considered a
problem, since these sessions are not the most important ones for
response time monitoring, and since historically they were excluded from
SNA/MS RTM collection.  The tn3270eTcpConnResourceType object in a
tn3270eTcpConnEntry (in the TN3270E-MIB) can be examined to determine if
a client session is ineligible for response time data collection for
this reason.

3.2  TN3270E Server Response Time Collection

A TN3270E server connects a Telnet client performing 3270 emulation to a
target SNA host over both a client-side network (client to TN3270E
server) and an SNA Network (TN3270E server to target SNA host).  The
client-side network is typically TCP/IP, but it need not be.  For ease
of exposition this document uses the term "IP network" to refer to the
client-side network, since IP is by far the most common protocol for
these networks.

A TN3270E server can use SNA definite responses and the TN3270
Enhancement (RFC 2355 [15]) RESPONSES function to calculate response
times for a transaction, by timestamping when a client request arrives
at the server, when the reply arrives from the target host, and when the
response acknowledging this reply arrives from the client.

Section 3.4, Timestamp Calculation, provides specifics on when in the
sequence of flows between a TN3270E client and its target SNA host a
TN3270E server takes the required timestamps.  In addition, it provides
information on how a TN3270 TIMING-MARK request/response flow can be
used instead of DR for approximating IP network transit times.

The following figure adds a TN3270E server between the client, in this
case a TN3270E client and the target SNA host:

        ------------------------------------------------

A TN3270E server can save timestamp D when it receives a client request,
save timestamp E when the target SNA host replies, and save timestamp F
when the client responds to the definite response request that flowed
with the reply.  It doesn't matter whether the target SNA host requested
a definite response on its reply:  if it didn't, the TN3270E server
makes the request on its own, to enable it to produce timestamp F.  In
this case the TN3270E server does not forward the response to the target
SNA host, as the dotted line in the figure indicates.

Because it is a special case, a transaction in which a target SNA host
returns an UNBIND in response to a client's request, and the TN3270E
server forwards the UNBIND to the client, is not included in any
response time calculations.

In order to generate timestamp F, a TN3270E server MUST insure that the
transaction specifies DR, and that the TN3270E RESPONSES function has
been negotiated between itself and the client.  Negotiation of the
TN3270E RESPONSES function occurs during the client's TN3270E session
initialization.  The TN3270E servers that the authors are aware of do
request the RESPONSES function during client session initialization.
TN3270E clients either automatically support the RESPONSES function, or
can be configured during startup to support it.

Using timestamps D, E, and F the following response times can be
calculated by a TN3270E server:

o   Total Response time:     Timestamp F - Timestamp D
o   IP Network Transit Time: Timestamp F - Timestamp E

Just as in the SNA case presented above, these response times are also
approximations, since the final +/- RSP from the client is being
substituted for the request from the client that began the transaction.

The MIB provides an object, tn3270eRtCollCtlType, to control several
aspects of response time data collection.  One of the available options
in setting up a response time collection policy is to eliminate the
IP-network component altogether.  This might be done because it is

TN3270E Working Group    Expires December 1998                  [Page 6]

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

determined either that the additional IP network traffic would not be
desirable, or that the IP-network component of the overall response
times is not significant.

Excluding the IP-network component from response times also has an
implication for the way in which response time data is aggregated.  A
TN3270E server may find that some of its clients simply don't support
any of the functions necessary for the server to calculate the
IP-network component of response times.  For these clients, the most
that the server can calculate is the SNA-network component of their
overall response times; the server records this SNA-network component as
the TOTAL response time each of these clients' transactions.  If a
response time collection is aggregating data from a number of clients,
some of which have the support necessary for including the IP-network
component in their total response time calculations, and some of which
do not, then the server aggregates the data differently depending on
whether the collection has been defined to include or exclude the
IP-network component:

o   If the IP-network component is included, then transactions for the
    clients that don't support calculation of the IP-network component
    of their response times are excluded from the aggregation
    altogether.

o   If the IP-network component is excluded, then total response times
    for ALL clients include only the SNA-network component, even though
    the server could have included an IP-network component in the
    overall response times for some of these clients.  The server does
    this by setting timestamp F, which marks the end of a transaction's
    total response time, equal to timestamp E, the end of the
    transaction's SNA-network component.

The principle here is that all the transactions contributing their
response times to an aggregated value MUST make the same contribution.
If the aggregation specifies that an IP-network component MUST be
included in the aggregation's response times, then transactions for
which an IP-network component cannot be calculated aren't included at
all.  If the aggregation specifies that an IP-network component is not
to be included, then only the SNA-network component is used, even for
those transactions for which an IP-network component could have been
calculated.

There is one more complication here:  the MIB allows a management
application to enable or disable dynamic definite responses for a
response time collection.  Once again the purpose of this option is to
give the network operator control over the amount of traffic introduced
into the IP network for response time data collection.  A DYNAMIC
definite response is one that the TN3270E server itself adds to a reply,
in a transaction for which the SNA application at the target SNA host
did not specify DR in its reply.  When the +/-RSP comes back from the
client, the server uses this response to calculate timestamp F, but then
it does not forward the response on to the SNA application (since the
application is not expecting a response to its reply).

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

The dynamic definite responses option is related to the option of
including or excluding the IP-network component of response times
(discussed above) as follows:

o   If the IP-network component is excluded, then there is no reason for
    enabling dynamic definite responses:  the server always sets
    timestamp F equal to timestamp E, so the additional IP-network
    traffic elicited by a dynamic definite response would serve no
    purpose.

o   If the IP-network component is included, then enabling dynamic
    definite responses causes MORE transactions to be included in the
    aggregated response time values:

    -   For clients that do not support sending of responses, timestamp
        F can never be calculated, and so their transactions are never
        included in the aggregate.

    -   For clients that support sending of responses, timestamp F will
        always be calculated for transactions in which the host SNA
        application specifies DR in its reply, and so these transactions
        will always be included in the aggregate.

    -   For clients that support sending of responses, having dynamic
        definite responses enabled for a collection results in the
        inclusion of additional transactions in the aggregate:
        specifically, those for which the host SNA application did not
        specify DR in its reply.

A TN3270E server also has the option of substituting TIMING-MARK
processing for definite responses in calculating the IP-network
component of a transaction's response time.  Once again, there is no
reason for the server to do this if the collection has been set up to
exclude the IP-network component altogether in computing response times.

The MIB is structured to keep counts and averages for total response
times (F - D) and their IP-network components (F - E).  A management
application can obviously calculate from these two values an average
SNA-network component (E - D) for the response times.  This SNA-network
component includes the SNA node processing time at both the TN3270E
server and at the target application.

A host TN3270E server refers to an implementation where the TN3270E
server is collocated with the Systems Network Architecture (SNA) System
Services Control Point (SSCP) for the dependent Secondary Logical Units
(SLUs) that the server makes available to its clients for connecting
into an SNA network.  A gateway TN3270E server resides on an SNA node
other than an SSCP, either an SNA type 2.0 node, a
boundary-function-attached type 2.1 node, or an APPN node acting in the
role of a Dependent LU Requester (DLUR).  Host and gateway TN3270E
server implementations typically differ greatly as to their internal
implementation and System Definition (SYSDEF) requirements.

If a host TN3270E server is in the same SNA host as the target
application, then the SNA-network component of a transaction's response

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

time will approximately equal the host transit time (B - A) described
previously.  A host TN3270E server implementation can, however,
typically support the establishment of sessions to target applications
in SNA hosts remote from itself.  In this case the SNA-network component
of the response time equals the actual SNA-network transit time plus two
host transit times.

3.3  Correlating TN3270E Server and Host Response Times

It is possible that response time data is collected from TN3270E servers
at the same time as a management application is monitoring the SNA
sessions at a host.  For example, a management application can be
monitoring a secondary logical unit (SLU) while retrieving data from a
TN3270E server.  Consider the following figure:

The following response times are available:

o   Target SNA host transit time:         Timestamp B - Timestamp A
o   Target SNA host network transit time: Timestamp C - Timestamp B
o   TN3270E server total response time:   Timestamp F - Timestamp D
o   TN3270E server IP-network component:  Timestamp F - Timestamp E

The value added by the TN3270E server in this situation is its
approximation of the IP-network component of the overall response time.
The IP-network component can be subtracted from the total network
transit time (which can be captured at an SSCP monitoring SNA traffic
from/to the SLU) to see the actual SNA versus IP network transit times.

The MIB defined by this memo does not specifically address correlation
of the data it contains with response time data collected by direct
monitoring of SNA resources:  its focus is exclusively response time
data collection from a TN3270E server perspective.  It has, however, in
conjunction with the TN3270E-MIB [10], been structured to provide the
information necessary for correlation between TN3270E server-provided
response time information and that gathered from directly monitoring SNA
resources.

A management application attempting to correlate SNA resource usage to
Telnet clients can monitor either the tn3270eResMapTable or the
tn3270eTcpConnTable to determine resource-to-client address mappings.
Both of these tables are defined by the TN3270E-MIB [10].  Another
helpful table is the tn3270eSnaMapTable, which provides a mapping
between SLU names as they are known at the SSCP (VTAM) and their local
names at the TN3270E server.  Neither the tn3270eClientGroupTable, the
tn3270eResPoolTable, nor the tn3270eClientResMapTable from the
TN3270E-MIB can be used for correlation, since the mappings defined by
these tables can overlap, and may not provide one-to-one mappings.

3.4  Timestamp Calculation

This section goes into more detail concerning when the various
timestamps can be taken as the flows between a TN3270E client and its
target SNA host pass through a TN3270E server.  In addition, information
is provided on how the TN3270 TIMING-MARK request/response flow can be
used in place of DR for approximating IP network transit times.

3.4.1  DR Usage

Consider the following flow:

     | |    +/-RSP          F                                 |
     |  >---------------------------------------->            |
     |                                                        |
     | BB : Begin Bracket    ER : Response by exception       |
     | EB : End Bracket      DR : Definite Response Requested |
     | CD : Change Direction FIC : First in chain             |

     ----------------------------------------------------------

Timestamp D is taken at the TN3270E server when the server has received
data from a client for forwarding to its target SNA host, and the
direction of the SNA session allows the server to forward the data
immediately (either the direction is inbound towards the SNA host, or

the session is between brackets).  This is most likely when the server
finds the end of record indicator in the TCP data received from the
client.

The target SNA application returns its reply in one or more SNA Request
Units (RUs); in this example there are four RUs in the reply.  The first
RU is marked as first in chain (FIC), the next two are marked as middle
in chain (MIC), and the last is marked as last in chain (LIC).  If the
SNA host sends a multiple-RU chain, the server does not know until the
last RU is received whether DR is being requested.  The server's only
chance to request DR from the client, however, comes when it forwards
the FIC RU, since this is the only time that the TN3270E header is
included.  Since a server may forward the FIC RU to the client before it
receives the LIC RU from the SNA host, some servers routinely specify DR
on all FIC RUs.

If the server has specified DR on the TN3270E request for the FIC RU in
a chain, it takes timestamp E when it forwards the LIC RU to the client.
Since timestamp E is used for calculating the IP-network time for the
transaction, the server SHOULD take timestamp E as close as possible to
its "Telnet edge".  The server takes timestamp F when it receives the
RESPONSES response from the client.

A target SNA application doesn't necessarily return data to a client in
a transaction; it may, for example, require more data from the client
before it can formulate a reply.  In this case the application may
simply return to the TN3270E server a change of direction indicator.  At
this point the server must send something to the client (typically a
Write operation with a WCC) to unlock the keyboard.  If the server
specifies DR on the request to the client triggered by its receipt of
the change of direction indicator from the SNA application, then
timestamps E and F can be taken, and the usual response times can be
calculated.  When the client sends in the additional data and gets a
textual response from the SNA application, the server treats this as a
separate transaction from the one involving the change of direction.

3.4.2  TIMING-MARK Usage

It is possible for a TN3270E server to use the TIMING-MARK flow for
approximating IP network transit times.  Using TIMING-MARKs would make
it possible for a server to collect performance data for TN3270 clients,
as well as for TN3270E clients that do not support the RESPONSES
function.  In order for TIMING-MARKs to be used in this way, a client
can't have the NOP option enabled, since responses are needed to the
server's TIMING-MARK requests.  An IP network transit time approximation
using a TIMING-MARK is basically the amount of time it takes for a
TN3270 server to receive from a client a response to a TIMING-MARK
request.

To get an estimate for IP network transit time, a TN3270E server sends a
TIMING-MARK request to a client after a LIC RU has been received, as a
means of approximating IP network transit time:

     ---------------------------------------------------

The response times can then be calculated as follows:

o   TN3270E server total response time:
            (Timestamp E - Timestamp D) + (Timestamp F' - Timestamp E')

o   TN3270E server IP network time:  Timestamp F' - Timestamp E'

If a TN3270E server is performing the TIMING-MARK function (independent
of the response time monitoring use of the function discussed here),
then it most likely has a TIMING-MARK interval for determining when to
examine client sessions for sending the TIMING-MARK request.  This
interval, which is ordinarily a global value for an entire TN3270E
server, is represented in the TN3270E-MIB by the
tn3270eSrvrConfTmNopInterval object.  A TIMING-MARK request is sent only
if, when it is examined, a client session is found to have had no
activity for a different fixed length of time, represented in the
TN3270E-MIB by the tn3270eSrvrConfTmNopInactTime object.

Servers that support a large number of client sessions should spread out
the TIMING-MARK requests they send to these clients over the activity
interval, rather than sending them all in a single burst, since
otherwise the network may be flooded with TIMING-MARK requests.  When a
server uses TIMING-MARKs for approximating response times, this tends to
introduce a natural spreading into its TIMING-MARK requests, since the
requests are triggered by the arrival of traffic from an SNA host.

A TN3270E server MUST integrate its normal TIMING-MARK processing with
its use of TIMING-MARKs for computing response times.  In particular, it
MUST NOT send a second TIMING-MARK request to a client while waiting for
the first to return, since this is ruled out by the TIMING-MARK protocol

itself.  If a TIMING-MARK flow has just been performed for a client
shortly before the LIC RU arrives, the server MAY use the interval from
this flow as its approximation for IP network transit time, (in other
words, as its (F' - E') value) when calculating its approximation for
the transaction's total response time, rather than sending a second
TIMING-MARK request so soon after the preceding one.

Regardless of when the server sends its TIMING-MARK request, the
accuracy of its total response time calculation depends on exactly when
the client responds to the TIMING-MARK request.

3.5  Performance Data Modelling

The following two subsections detail how the TN3270E-RT-MIB models and
controls capture of two types of response time data:  average response
times and response time buckets.

3.5.1  Averaging Response Times

Average response times play two different roles in the MIB:

o   They are made available for management applications to retrieve.
o   They serve as triggers for emitting notifications.

Sliding-window averages are used rather than straight interval-based
averages, because they are often more meaningful, and because they cause
less notification thrashing.  Sliding-window average calculation can, if
necessary, be disabled, by setting the sample period multiplier,
tn3270eRtCollCtlSPMult, to 1, and setting the sample period,
tn3270eRtCollCtlSPeriod, to the required collection interval.

In order to calculate sliding-window averages, a TN3270E server MUST:

o   Select a fixed, relatively short, sample period SPeriod; the default
    value for SPeriod in the MIB is 20 seconds.

o   Select an averaging period multiplier SPMult.  The actual collection
    interval will then be SPMult times SPeriod.  The default value for
    SPMult in the MIB is 30, yielding a default collection interval of
    10 minutes.  Note that the collection interval (SPMult*SPeriod) is
    always a multiple of the sample period.

    Clearlly, SPMult*SPeriod should not be thought of as literally the
    averaging period.  The average calculated will include contributions
    older than that time, and does not weight equally all contributions
    since that time.  In fact, it gives a smoother result than a
    traditional sliding average, as used in finance.  More subtly, it is
    best to think of the effective averaging period as being
    2*SPMult*SPeriod.  To see this, consider how long the contribution
    to the result made by a particular transaction lasts.  With a
    traditional sliding average, it lasts exactly the averaging period.
    With the aging mechanism described here, it has a half-life of
    SPMult*SPeriod.

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

o   Maintain the following counters to keep track of activity within the
    current sample period; these are internal counters, not made visible
    to a management application via the MIB.

    -   T (number of transactions in the period)

    -   TotalRts (sum of the total response times for all transactions
        in the period)

    -   TotalIpRts (sum of the IP network transit times for all
        transactions in the period; note that if IP network transit
        times are being excluded from the response time collection, this
        value will always be 0).

o   Also maintain sliding counters, initialized to zero, for each of the
    quantities being counted:

    -   AvgCountTrans (sliding count of transactions)
    -   TotalRtsSliding (sliding count of total response times)
    -   TotalIpRtsSliding (sliding count of IP network transit times)

o   At the end of each sample period, update the sliding interval
    counters, using the following floating-point calculations:

             AvgCountTrans = AvgCountTrans + T
                  - (AvgCountTrans / SPMult)

             TotalRtsSliding = TotalRtsSliding + TotalRts
                  - (TotalRtsSliding / SPMult)

             TotalIpRtsSliding = TotalIpRtsSliding + TotalIpRts
                  - (TotalIpRtsSliding / SPMult)

    Then reset T, TotalRts, and TotalIpRts to zero for use during the
    next sample period.

o   At the end of a collection interval, update the following MIB
    objects as indicated; the floating-point numbers are rounded rather
    than truncated.

        tn3270eRtDataAvgCountTrans = AvgCountTrans
        tn3270eRtDataAvgRt = TotalRtsSliding / AvgCountTrans
        tn3270eRtDataAvgIpRt = TotalIpRtsSliding / AvgCountTrans

    As expected, if IP network transit times are being excluded from
    response time collection, then tn3270eRtDataAvgIpRt will always
    return 0.

The sliding transaction counter AvgCountTrans is not used for updating
the MIB object tn3270eRtDataCountTrans:  this object is an ordinary SMI
Counter32, which maintains a total count of transactions since its last
discontinuity event.  The sliding counters are used only for calculating
averages.

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

Two mechanisms are present in the MIB to inhibit the generation of an
excessive number of notifications related to average response times.
First, there are high and low thresholds for average response times. A
tn3270eRtExceeded notification is generated the first time a
statistically significant average response time is found to have
exceeded the high threshold.  (The test for statistical significance is
described below.)  After this, no other tn3270eRtExceeded notifications
are generated until an average response time is found to have fallen
below the low threshold.

The other mechanism to limit notifications is the significance test for
a high average response time.  Intuitively, the significance of an
average is directly related to the number of samples that go into it; so
we might be inclined to use a rule such as "for the purpose of
generating tn3270eRtExceeded notifications, ignore average response
times based on fewer than 20 transactions in the sample period."

In the case of response times, however, the number of transactions
sampled in a fixed sampling period is tied to these transactions'
response times.  A few transactions with long response times can
guarantee that there will not be many transactions in a sample, because
these transactions "use up" the sampling time.  Yet this case of a few
transactions with very poor response times should obviously be
classified as a problem, not as a statistical anomaly based on too small
a sample.

The solution is to make the significance level for a sample a function
of the average response time.  A value IdleCount is specified, which is
used to qualify an sample as statistically significant.  In order to
determine at a collection interval whether to generate a
tn3270eRtExceeded notification, a TN3270E server uses the following
algorithm:

   if AvgCountTrans * ((AvgRt/ThreshHigh - 1) ** 2) >=  IdleCount
   then generate the notification,

where AvgRt is the value that would be returned by the object
tn3270eRtDataAvgRt at the end of the interval, and the "**" notation
indicates exponientiation.

Two examples illustrate how this algorithm works.  Suppose that
IdleCount has been set to 20 transactions, and the high threshold to 200
msecs per transaction.  If the average observed response time is 300
msecs, then a notification will be generated only if AvgCountTrans >=
80.  If, however, the observed response time is 500 msecs, then a
notification is generated if AvgCountTrans >= 9.

There is no corresponding significance test for the tn3270eRtOkay
notification:  this notification is generated based on an average
response time that falls below the low threshold, regardless of the
sample size behind that average.

3.5.2  Response Time Buckets

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

The MIB also supports collection of response time data into a set of
five buckets. This data is suitable either for verification of service
level agreements, or for monitoring by a management application to
identify performance problems.  The buckets provide counts of
transactions whose total response times fall into a set of specified
ranges.

Like everything for a collection, the "total" response times collected
in the buckets are governed by the specification of whether IP network
transit times are to be included in the totals.  Depending on how this
option is specified, the response times being counted in the buckets
will either be total response times (F - D), or only SNA network transit
times (effectively E - D, because when it is excluding the IP-network
component of transactions, a server makes timestamp F identical to
timestamp E).

Four bucket boundaries are specified for a response time collection,
resulting in five buckets.  The first response time bucket counts those
transactions whose total response times were less than or equal to
Boundary 1, the second bucket counts those whose response times were
greater than Boundary 1 but less than or equal to Boundary 2, and so on.
The fifth bucket is unbounded on the top, counting all transactions
whose response times were greater than Boundary 4.

The four bucket boundaries have default values of:  1 second, 2 seconds,
5 seconds, and 10 seconds, respectively.  These values are the defaults
in the 3174 controller's implementation of the SNA/MS RTM function, and
are thought to be appropriate for this MIB as well.

In SNA/MS the counter buckets were (by today's standards) relatively
small, with a maximum value of 65,535.  The bucket objects in the MIB
are all Counter32's.

The following figure represents the buckets pictorially:

The tn3270eRtCollCtlType object controls the type(s) of response time
collection that occur, the granularity of the collection, whether
dynamic definite responses SHOULD be initiated, and whether
notifications SHOULD be generated.  This object is of BITS SYNTAX, and
thus allows selection of multiple options.

The BITS in the tn3270eRtCollCtlType object have the following meanings:

o   aggregate(0) - If this bit is set to 1, then data SHOULD be
    aggregated for the whole client group.  In this case there will be
    only one row created for the collection in the tn3270eRtDataTable.
    The first two indexes for this row, tn3270eSrvrConfIndex and
    tn3270eClientGroupName, will have the same values as the indexes for
    the corresponding tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry.  The third and fourth
    indexes of an aggregated tn3270eRtDataEntry have the values
    unknown(0) (tn3270eRtDataClientAddrType) and a zero-length octet
    string (tn3270eRtDataClientAddress).  The fifth index,
    tn3270eRtDataClientPort, has the value 0.

    If this bit is set to 0, then a separate entry is created in the
    tn3270eRtDataTable for each member of the client group.  In this
    case tn3270eRtDataClientAddress contains the client's actual IP
    Address, tn3270eRtDataClientAddrType indicates the address type, and
    tn3270eRtDataClientPort contains the number of the port the client
    is using for its TN3270/TN3270E session.

o   excludeIpComponent(1) - If this bit is set to 1, then the server
    SHOULD exclude the IP-network component from all the response times
    for this collection.  If the target SNA application specifies DR in
    any of its replies, this DR will still be passed down to the client,
    and the client's response will still be forwarded to the
    application.  But this response will play no role in the server's
    response time calculations.

    If this bit is set to 0, then the server includes in the collection
    only those transactions for which it can include an (approximate)
    IP-network component in the total response time for the transaction.
    This component MAY be derived from a "natural" DR (if the client
    supports the RESPONSES function), from a dynamic DR introduced by
    the server (if the client supports the RESPONSES function and the
    ddr(2) bit has been set to 1), or from TIMING-MARK processing (if
    the client supports TIMING-MARKs).

    If this bit is set to 1, then the ddr(2) bit is ignored, since there
    is no reason for the server to request additional responses from the
    client(s) in the group.

o   ddr(2) - If this bit is set to 1, then the server SHOULD, for those
    clients in the group that support the RESPONSES function, add a DR
    request to the FIC reply in each transaction, and use the client's
    subsequent response for calculating an (approximate) IP-network
    component to include in the transaction's total response times.

    If this bit is set to 0, then the server does not add a DR request
    that it was not otherwise going to add to any replies from the
    target SNA application.

    If the excludeIpComponent(1) bit is set to 1, then this bit is
    ignored by the server.

o   average(3) - If this bit is set to 1, then the server SHOULD
    calculate a sliding-window average for the collection, based on the
    parameters specified for the group.

    If this bit is set to 0, then an average is not calculated.  In this
    case the tn3270eRtExceeded and tn3270eRtOkay notifications are not
    generated, even if the traps(5) bit is set to 1.

o   buckets(4) - If this bit is set to 1, then the server SHOULD create
    and increment response time buckets for the collection, based on the
    parameters specified for the group.

    If this bit is set to 0, then response time buckets are not created.

o   traps(5) - If this bit is set to 1, then a TN3270E Server is enabled
    to generate notifications pertaining to an tn3270eCollCtlEntry.
    tn3270CollStart and tn3270CollEnd generation is enabled simply by
    traps(5) being set to 1.  tn3270eRtExceeded and tn3270eRtOkay
    generation enablement requires that average(3) be set to 1 in
    addition to the traps(5) requirement.

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

    If traps(5) is set to 0, then none of the notifications defined in
    this MIB are generated for a particular tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry.

Either the average(3) or the buckets(4) bit MUST be set to 1 in order
for response time data collection to occur; both bits MAY be set to 1.
If the average(3) bit is set to 1, then the following objects have
meaning, and are used to control the calculation of the averages, as
well as the generation of the two notifications related to them:

o   tn3270eRtCollCtlSPeriod
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlSPMult
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlIdleCount

The previous objects' values are meaningless if the associated
average(3) bit is not set to 1.

If the buckets(4) bit is set to 1, then the following objects have
meaning, and specify the bucket boundaries:

o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry1
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry2
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry3
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry4

The previous objects' values are meaningless if the associated
buckets(4) bit is not set to 1.

If an entry in the tn3270RtCollCtlTable has the value active(1) for its
RowStatus, then an implementation SHALL NOT allow Set operations for any
objects in the entry except:

o   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlRowStatus

4.2  tn3270eRtDataTable

Either a single entry or multiple entries are created in the
tn3270eRtDataTable for each tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry, depending on whether
tn3270eRtCollCtlType in the control entry has aggregate(0) selected.
The contents of an entry in the tn3270eRtDataTable depend on the
contents of the corresponding entry in the tn3270eRtCollCtlTable:  as
described above, some objects in the data entry return meaningful values
only when the average(3) option is selected in the control entry, while
others return meaningful values only when the buckets(4) option is
selected.  If both options are selected, then all the objects return
meaningful values.  When an object is not specified to return a
meaningful value, an implementation may return any syntactically valid
value in response to a Get operation.

The following objects return meaningful values if and only if the
average(3) option was selected in the corresponding
tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry:

o   tn3270eRtDataAvgRt
o   tn3270eRtDataAvgIpRt
o   tn3270eRtDataAvgCountTrans

o   tn3270eRtDataTotalRts
o   tn3270eRtDataTotalIpRts
o   tn3270eRtDataCountTrans
o   tn3270eRtDataCountDrs
o   tn3270eRtDataElapsRndTrpSq
o   tn3270eRtDataElapsIpRtSq

The first three objects in this list return values derived from the
sliding-window average calculations described earlier.  The time of the
most recent sample for these calculations is returned in the
tn3270eRtDataIntTimeStamp object.  The next four objects are normal
Counter32 objects, maintaining counts of total response time and total
transactions.  The last two objects return sum of the squares values, to
enable variance calculations by a management application.

The following objects return meaningful values if and only if the
buckets(4) option was selected in the corresponding
tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry:

o   tn3270eRtDataBucket1Rts
o   tn3270eRtDataBucket2Rts
o   tn3270eRtDataBucket3Rts
o   tn3270eRtDataBucket4Rts
o   tn3270eRtDataBucket5Rts

A discontinuity object, tn3270eRtDataDiscontinuityTime, can be used by a
management application to detect when the values of the counter objects
in this table may have been reset, or otherwise experienced a
discontinuity.  A possible cause for such a discontinuity is the TN3270E
server's being stopped or restarted.  This object returns a meaningful
value regardless of which collection control options were selected.

An object, tn3270eRtDataRtMethod, identifies whether the IP Network Time
was calculated using either the definite response or TIMING-MARK
approach.

When an entry is created in the tn3270eRtCollCtlTable with its
tn3270eRtCollCtlType aggregate(0) bit set to 1, an entry is
automatically created in the tn3270eRtDataTable; this entry's
tn3270eRtDataClientAddress has the value of a zero-length octet string,
its tn3270eRtDataClientAddrType has the value of unknown(0), and its
tn3270eRtDataClientPort has the value 0.

When an entry is created in the tn3270eRtCollCtlTable with its
tn3270eRtCollCtlType aggregate(0) bit set to 0, a separate entry is
created in the tn3270eRtDataTable for each member of the client group
that currently has a session with the TN3270E server.  Entries are
subsequently created for clients that the TN3270E server determines to
be members of the client group when these clients establish sessions
with the server.  Entries are also created when clients with existing
sessions are added to the group.

All entries associated with a tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry are deleted from the
tn3270eRtDataTable when that entry is deleted from the
tn3270eRtCollCtlTable.  An entry for an individual client in a client
group is deleted when its TCP connection terminates.  Once it has been
created, a client's entry in the tn3270eRtDataTable remains active as
long as the collection's tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry exists, even if the
client is removed from the client group for the tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry.

4.3  Notifications

This MIB defines four notifications related to a tn3270eRtDataEntry.  If
the associated tn3270eRtCollCtlType object's traps(5) bit is set to 1,
then the tn3270RtCollStart and tn3270RtCollEnd notifications are
generated when, respsectively, the tn3270eRtDataEntry is created and
deleted.  If, in addition, this tn3270eRtCollCtlType object's average(3)
bit is set to 1, then the the tn3270eRtExceeded and tn3270eRtOkay
notifications are generated when the conditions they report occur.

The following notifications are defined by this MIB:

o   tn3270eRtExceeded - The purpose of this notification is to signal
    that a performance problem has been detected.  If average(3)
    response time data is being collected, then this notification is
    generated whenever (1) an average response time is first found, on a
    collection interval boundary, to have exceeded the high threshold
    tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh specified for the client group, AND (2)
    the sample on which the average is based is determined to have been
    a significant one, via the significance algorithm described earlier.
    This notification is not generated again for a tn3270eRtDataEntry
    until an average response time falling below the low threshold
    tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow specified for the client group has
    occurred for the entry.

o   tn3270eRtOkay - The purpose of this notification is to signal that a
    previously reported performance problem has been resolved. If
    average(3) response time data is being collected, then this
    notification is generated whenever (1) a tn3270eRtExceeded
    notification has already been generated, AND (2) an average response
    time is first found, on a collection interval boundary, to have
    fallen below the low threshold tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow specified
    for the client group.  This notification is not generated again for
    a tn3270eRtDataEntry until an average response time exceeding the
    high threshold tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh specified for the client
    group has occurred for the entry.

Taken together, the two preceding notifications serve to minimize the
generation of an excessive number of traps in the case of an average
response time that oscillates about its high threshold.

o   tn3270eRtCollStart - This notification is generated whenever data
    collection begins for a client group, or when a new
    tn3270eRtDataEntry becomes active.  The primary purpose of this
    notification is signal to a management application that a new client
    TCP session has been established, and to provide the IP-to-resource
    mapping for the session.  This notification is not critical when

Internet Draft               TN3270E-RT MIB                    June 1998

    average(3) data collection is not being performed for the client
    group.

o   tn3270eRtCollEnd - This notification is generated whenever a data
    collection ends.  For an aggregate collection, this occurs when the
    corresponding tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry is deleted.  For an individual
    collection, this occurs either when the tn3270eRtCollCtlEntry is
    deleted, or when the client's TCP connection terminates.  The
    purpose of this notification is to enable a management application
    to complete a monitoring function that it was performing, by
    returning final values for the collection's data objects.

4.4  Advisory Spin Lock Usage

Within the TN3270E-RT-MIB, tn3270eRtSpinLock is defined as an advisory
lock that allows cooperating TN3270E-RT-MIB applications to coordinate
their use of the tn3270eRtCollCtlTable.  When creating a new entry or
altering an existing entry in the tn3270eRtCollCtlTable, an application
SHOULD make use of tn3270eRtSpinLock to serialize application changes or
additions.  Since this is an advisory lock, its use by management
applications SHALL NOT be enforced by agents.  Agents MUST, however,
implement the tn3270eRtSpinLock object.

6.0  Security Considerations

Certain management information defined in this MIB may be considered
sensitive in some network environments.  Therefore, authentication of
received SNMP requests and controlled access to management information
SHOULD be employed in such environments.  An authentication protocol is
defined in [10].  A protocol for access control is defined in [11].

Several objects in this MIB allow write access or provide for row
creation.  Allowing this support in a non-secure environment can have a
negative effect on network operations.  It is RECOMMENDED that
implementers seriously consider whether set operations or row creation
SHOULD be allowed without providing, at a minimum, authentication of
request origin.  It is RECOMMENDED that without such support that the
following objects be implemented as read-only:

o   tn3270eRtCollCtlType
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlSPeriod
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlSPMult
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshHigh
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlThreshLow
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlIdleCount
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry1
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry2
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry3
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlBucketBndry4
o   tn3270eRtCollCtlRowStatus
