1.  Introduction

   Mechanisms to support event subscription and push are defined in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  Enhancements to
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] which enable YANG
   datastore subscription and push are defined in
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].  This document provides a transport
   specification for dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF [RFC8040].
   Driving these requirements is [RFC7923].

Internet-Draft               RESTCONF-Notif                 October 2018


   The streaming of notifications encapsulating the resulting
   information push is done via the mechanism described in section 6.3
   of [RFC8040].

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   The following terms use the definitions from
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]: dynamic
   subscription, event stream, notification message, publisher,
   receiver, subscriber, and subscription.

   Other terms reused include datastore, which is defined in [RFC8342],
   and HTTP2 stream which maps to the definition of "stream" within
   [RFC7540], Section 2.

   [ note to the RFC Editor - please replace XXXX within this document
   with the number of this document ]

3.  Dynamic Subscriptions

   This section provides specifics on how to establish and maintain
   dynamic subscriptions over RESTCONF [RFC8040].  Subscribing to event
   streams is accomplished in this way via a RESTCONF POST into RPCs
   defined within [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]
   Section 2.4.  YANG datastore subscription is accomplished via
   augmentations to [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] as
   described within [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] Section 4.4.

   As described in [RFC8040] Section 6.3, a GET needs to be made against
   a specific URI on the publisher.  Subscribers cannot pre-determine
   the URI against which a subscription might exist on a publisher, as
   the URI will only exist after the "establish-subscription" RPC has
   been accepted.  The subscription URI will be determined and sent as
   part of the response to the "establish-subscription" RPC, and a
   subsequent GET to this URI will be done in order to start the flow of
   notification messages back to the subscriber.  A subscription does
   not move to the active state as per Section 2.4.1. of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] until the GET is
   received.  The POST for the "establish-subscription" RPC replaces the
   GET request for the "location" leaf which is used in [RFC8040] to
   obtain the URI.

3.1.  Transport Connectivity

   For a dynamic subscription, where an HTTP client session doesn't
   already exist, a new client session is initiated from the subscriber.

   As stated in Section 2.1 of [RFC8040], a subscriber MUST establish
   the HTTP session over TLS [RFC5246] in order to secure the content in
   transit.

   Without the involvement of additional protocols, HTTP sessions by
   themselves do not allow for a quick recognition of when the
   communication path has been lost with the publisher.  Where quick
   recognition of the loss of a publisher is required, a subscriber
   SHOULD use a TLS heartbeat [RFC6520], just from receiver to
   publisher, to track HTTP session continuity.  Loss of the heartbeat
   MUST result in any subscription related TCP sessions between those
   endpoints being torn down.  A subscriber can then attempt to re-
   establish.

3.2.  Discovery

   Subscribers can learn what event streams a RESTCONF server supports
   by querying the "streams" container of ietf-subscribed-
   notification.yang in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications].  Support for the
   "streams" container of ietf-restconf-monitoring.yang in [RFC6520] is
   not required.

   Subscribers can learn what datastores a RESTCONF server supports by
   following [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-nmda-restconf].

3.3.  RESTCONF RPCs and HTTP Status Codes

   Specific HTTP responses codes as defined in [RFC7231] section 6 will
   indicate the result of RESTCONF RPC requests with publisher.  An HTTP
   status code of 200 is the proper response to any successful RPC
   defined within [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push].

   If a publisher fails to serve the RPC request for one of the reasons
   indicated in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]
   Section 2.4.6 or [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] Appendix A, this will
   be indicated by "406" status code transported in the HTTP response.

   When a "406" status code is returned, the RPC reply MUST include an
   "rpc-error" element per [RFC8040] Section 7.1 with the following
   parameter values:

   o  an "error-type" node of "application".

   o  an "error-tag" node of "operation-failed".

   o  an "error-app-tag" node with the value being a string that
      corresponds to an identity associated with the error, as defined
      in [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] section 2.4.6
      for general subscriptions, and [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push]
      Appendix A.1, for datastore subscriptions.  The tag to use depends
      on the RPC for which the error occurred.  Viable errors for
      different RPCs are as follows:

            RPC                     select an identity with a base
            ----------------------  ------------------------------
            establish-subscription  establish-subscription-error
            modify-subscription     modify-subscription-error
            delete-subscription     delete-subscription-error
            kill-subscription       kill-subscription-error
            resynch-subscription    resynch-subscription-error

   Each error identity will be inserted as the "error-app-tag" using
   JSON encoding following the form <modulename>:<identityname>.  An
   example of such as valid encoding would be "ietf-subscribed-
   notifications:no-such-subscription".

   o  In case of error responses to an "establish-subscription" or
      "modify-subscription" request there is the option of including an
      "error-info" node.  This node may contain hints for parameter
      settings that might lead to successful RPC requests in the future.
      Following are the yang-data structures which may be returned:

Internet-Draft               RESTCONF-Notif                 October 2018


      establish-subscription returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   establish-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      establish-subscription-datastore-error-info

      modify-subscription    returns hints in yang-data structure
      ---------------------- ------------------------------------
      target: event stream   modify-subscription-stream-error-info
      target: datastore      modify-subscription-datastore-error-info

      The yang-data included within "error-info" SHOULD NOT include the
      optional leaf "error-reason", as such a leaf would be redundant
      with information that is already placed within the
      "error-app-tag".

      In case of an rpc error as a result of a "delete-subscription", a
      "kill-subscription", or a "resynch-subscription" request, no
      "error-info" needs to be included, as the "subscription-id" is
      the only RPC input parameter and no hints regarding this RPC input
      parameters need to be provided.

   Note that "error-path" does not need to be included with the "rpc-
   error" element, as subscription errors are generally not associated
   with nodes in the datastore but with the choice of RPC input
   parameters.

3.4.  Call Flow for Server-Sent Events (SSE)

   The call flow is defined in Figure 1.  The logical connections
   denoted by (a) and (b) can be a TCP connection or an HTTP2 stream.
   Requests to [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] or
   [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] augmented RPCs are sent on a connection
   indicated by (a).  A successful "establish-subscription" will result
   in an RPC response returned with both a subscription identifier which
   uniquely identifies a subscription, as well as a URI which uniquely
   identifies the location of subscription on the publisher (b).  This
   URI is defined via the "uri" leaf the Data Model in Section 8.

   An HTTP GET is then sent on a separate logical connection (b) to the
   URI on the publisher.  This initiates the publisher to initiate the
   flow of notification messages which are sent in SSE [W3C-20150203] as
   a response to the GET.

                 Figure 1: Dynamic with server-sent events

   Additional requirements for dynamic subscriptions over SSE include:

   o  All subscription state notifications from a publisher MUST be
      returned in a separate SSE message used by the subscription to
      which the state change refers.

   o  Subscription RPCs MUST NOT use the connection currently providing
      notification messages for that subscription.

   o  In addition to an RPC response for a "modify-subscription" RPC
      traveling over (a), a "subscription-modified" state change
      notification must be sent within (b).  This allows the receiver to
      know exactly when the new terms of the subscription have been
      applied to the notification messages.  See arrow (c).

Internet-Draft               RESTCONF-Notif                 October 2018


   A publisher MUST terminate a subscription in the following cases:

   o  Receipt of a "delete-subscription" or a "kill-subscription" RPC
      for that subscription.

   o  Loss of TLS heartbeat

   A publisher MAY terminate a subscription at any time as stated in
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] Section 1.3

4.  QoS Treatment

   To meet subscription quality of service promises, the publisher MUST
   take any existing subscription "dscp" and apply it to the DSCP
   marking in the IP header.

   In addition, where HTTP2 transport is available to a notification
   message queued for transport to a receiver, the publisher MUST:

   o  take any existing subscription "priority" and copy it into the
      HTTP2 stream priority, and

   o  take any existing subscription "dependency" and map the HTTP2
      stream for the parent subscription into the HTTP2 stream
      dependency.

5.  Mandatory JSON and datastore support

   A publisher supporting [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push] MUST support the
   "operational" datastore as defined by [RFC8342].

   The "encode-json" feature of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications] is mandatory to
   support.  This indicates that JSON is a valid encoding for RPCs,
   state change notifications, and subscribed content.

6.  Notification Messages

   Notification messages transported over HTTP will be encoded using
   one-way operation schema defined within [RFC5277], section 4.

7.  YANG Tree

   The YANG model defined in Section 8 has one leaf augmented into four
   places of [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications], plus two
   identities.  As the resulting full tree is large, it will only be
   inserted at later stages of this document.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following namespace URI in the "IETF XML
   Registry" [RFC3688]:

   URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-subscribed-
   notifications
   Registrant Contact: The IESG.
   XML: N/A; the requested URI is an XML namespace.

   This document registers the following YANG module in the "YANG Module
   Names" registry [RFC6020]:

   Name: ietf-restconf-subscribed-notifications
   Namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-restconf-subscribed-
   notifications
   Prefix: rsn
   Reference: RFC XXXX: RESTCONF Transport for Event Notifications

10.  Security Considerations

   The YANG module specified in this document defines a schema for data
   that is designed to be accessed via network management transports
   such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF
   layer is the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement
   secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest
   RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is TLS [RFC5246].

   The one new data node introduced in this YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to this data nodes.  These are the subtrees and data
   nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   Container: "/subscriptions"

   o  "uri": leaf will show where subscribed resources might be located
      on a publisher.  Access control must be set so that only someone
      with proper access permissions, and perhaps even HTTP session has
      the ability to access this resource.

            Figure 2: Multiple subscriptions over RESTCONF/HTTP

   To provide examples of the information being transported, example
   messages for interactions in Figure 2 are detailed below:

   POST /restconf/operations/subscriptions:establish-subscription

   {
      "ietf-subscribed-notifications:input": {
         "stream": "NETCONF",
         "stream-xpath-filter": "/ds:foo/",
         "dscp": "10"
      }
   }

               Figure 3: establish-subscription request (a)

   As publisher was able to fully satisfy the request, the publisher
   sends the subscription identifier of the accepted subscription, and
   the URI:

      "id": "22",
      "uri": "/subscriptions/22"
   }


               Figure 4: establish-subscription success (b)

   Upon receipt of the successful response, the subscriber does a GET
   the provided URI to start the flow of notification messages.  When
   the publisher receives this, the subscription is moved to the active
   state (c).

   GET /restconf/operations/subscriptions/22


             Figure 5: establish-subscription subsequent POST

   While not shown in Figure 2, if the publisher had not been able to
   fully satisfy the request, or subscriber has no authorization to
   establish the subscription, the publisher would have sent an RPC
   error response.  For instance, if the "dscp" value of 10 asserted by
   the subscriber in Figure 3 proved unacceptable, the publisher may
   have returned:

         HTTP status code - 406

         { "ietf-restconf:errors" : {
             "error" : [
               {

                 "error-tag": "operation-failed",
                 "error-severity": "error",
                 "error-app-tag":
                     "ietf-subscribed-notifications:dscp-unavailable"
               }
             ]
           }
         }

   The subscriber can use this information in future attempts to
   establish a subscription.

A.1.2.  Modifying Dynamic Subscriptions

   An existing subscription may be modified.  The following exchange
   shows a negotiation of such a modification via several exchanges
   between a subscriber and a publisher.  This negotiation consists of a
   failed RPC modification request/response, followed by a successful
   one.

   Figure 7: Interaction model for successful subscription modification

   If the subscription being modified in Figure 7 is a datastore
   subscription as per [I-D.ietf-netconf-yang-push], the modification
   request made in (d) may look like that shown in Figure 8.  As can be
   seen, the modifications being attempted are the application of a new
   xpath filter as well as the setting of a new periodic time interval.

              Figure 8: Subscription modification request (c)

   If the publisher can satisfy both changes, the publisher sends a
   positive result for the RPC.  If the publisher cannot satisfy either
   of the proposed changes, the publisher sends an RPC error response
   (e).  The following is an example RPC error response for (e) which
   includes a hint.  This hint is an alternative time period value which
   might have resulted in a successful modification:

         HTTP status code - 406

         { "ietf-restconf:errors" : {
             "error" : [

A.1.3.  Deleting Dynamic Subscriptions

   The following demonstrates deleting a subscription.  This
   subscription may have been to either a stream or a datastore.

                      Figure 10: Delete subscription

   If the publisher can satisfy the request, the publisher replies with
   success to the RPC request.

   If the publisher cannot satisfy the request, the publisher sends an
   error-rpc element indicating the modification didn't work.  Figure 11
   shows a valid response for existing valid subscription identifier,
   but that subscription identifier was created on a different transport
   session:

A.2.  Subscription State Notifications

   A publisher will send subscription state notifications according to
   the definitions within
   [I-D.draft-ietf-netconf-subscribed-notifications]).

A.2.1.  subscription-modified

   A "subscription-modified" encoded in JSON would look like:

     }
   }

A.2.2.  subscription-completed, subscription-resumed, and replay-
        complete

   A "subscription-completed" would look like:


   {
     "ietf-restconf:notification" : {
       "eventTime": "2007-09-01T10:00:00Z",

         "id": "39",
       }
     }
   }

   The "subscription-resumed" and "replay-complete" are virtually
   identical, with "subscription-completed" simply being replaced by
   "subscription-resumed" and "replay-complete".

A.2.3.  subscription-terminated and subscription-suspended

   A "subscription-terminated" would look like:

         "error-id": "suspension-timeout"
       }
     }
   }

   The "subscription-suspended" is virtually identical, with
   "subscription-terminated" simply being replaced by "subscription-
   suspended".

A.3.  Filter Example

   This section provides an example which illustrate the method of
   filtering event record contents.  The example is based on the YANG
   notification "vrrp-protocol-error-event" as defined per the ietf-
   vrrp.yang module within [RFC8347].  Event records based on this
   specification which are generated by the publisher might appear as:

         data: {
         data:   "ietf-restconf:notification" : {
         data:     "eventTime" : "2018-09-14T08:22:33.44Z",
         data:     "ietf-vrrp:vrrp-protocol-error-event" : {
         data:       "protocol-error-reason" : "checksum-error"
         data:     }
         data:   }
         data: }

             Figure 15: RFC 8347 (VRRP) - Example Notification

   Suppose a subscriber wanted to establish a subscription which only
   passes instances of event records where there is a "checksum-error"
   as part of a VRRP protocol event.  Also assume the publisher places
   such event records into the NETCONF stream.  To get a continuous
   series of matching event records, the subscriber might request the
   application of an XPath filter against the NETCONF stream.  An
   "establish-subscription" RPC to meet this objective might be:

POST /restconf/operations/subscriptions:establish-subscription
{
   "ietf-subscribed-notifications:input": {
      "stream": "NETCONF",
      "stream-xpath-filter": "/ietf-vrrp:vrrp-protocol-error-event[protocol-error-reason='checksum-error']/",
   }
}

       Figure 16: Establishing a subscription error reason via XPATH

   For more examples of xpath filters, see [XPATH].

   Suppose the "establish-subscription" in Figure 16 was accepted.  And
   suppose later a subscriber decided they wanted to broaden this
   subscription cover to all VRRP protocol events (i.e., not just those
   with a "checksum error").  The subscriber might attempt to modify the
   subscription in a way which replaces the XPath filter with a subtree
   filter which sends all VRRP protocol events to a subscriber.  Such a
   "modify-subscription" RPC might look like:

 POST /restconf/operations/subscriptions:modify-subscription
 {
    "ietf-subscribed-notifications:input": {
       "stream": "NETCONF",
       "stream-subtree-filter": "/ietf-vrrp:vrrp-protocol-error-event/",
    }
 }

                                 Figure 17

   For more examples of subtree filters, see [RFC6241], section 6.4.
