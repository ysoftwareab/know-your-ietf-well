Abstract  
    
   MPLS to GMPLS migration is the process of evolving MPLS-TE-based 
   control plane to GMPLS-based control plane. An appropriate migration 
   strategy is selected based on various factors including the service 
   provider's network deployment plan, customer demand, available 
   network equipment implementation, etc.  
    
   In the course of migration several interworking cases may exist where 
   MPLS and GMPLS devices or networks must coexist. Such cases may arise 
   as parts of the network are converted from MPLS protocols to GMPLS 
   protocols, or may occur if a lower layer network is made GMPLS-
   capable (from having no MPLS or GMPLS control plane) in advance of 
   the migration of the higher layer packet switched layer.

1. Introduction 
    
   MPLS to GMPLS migration is the process of evolving MPLS-TE-based 
   control plane to GMPLS-based control plane. 
    
   There are several motivations for such migration and they focus 
   mainly on the desire to take advantage of new features and functions 
   that have been added to the GMPLS protocols but which are not present 
   in MPLS. 
    
   An appropriate migration strategy is selected based on various 
   factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, 
   customer demand, available network equipment implementation, etc.  
    
   In the course of migration several interworking cases may arise where 
   MPLS and GMPLS devices or networks must coexist. Such cases may occur 
   as parts of the network are converted from MPLS protocols to GMPLS 
   protocols, or may arise if a lower layer network is made GMPLS-
   capable (from having no MPLS or GMPLS control plane) in advance of 
   the migration of the higher layer network.  
    
   This document examines the interworking scenarios that arise during 
   migration, and examines the implications for network deployments and 
   for protocol usage. Since GMPLS signaling and routing protocols are 
   different from the MPLS protocols, interworking between MPLS and 
   GMPLS networks or network elements needs mechanisms to compensate for 
   the differences. This document provides a framework for MPLS and 
   GMPLS interworking in support of migration from IP/MPLS to GMPLS by 
   discussing issues, models, migration scenarios, and requirements. 
   Solutions for interworking MPLS and GMPLS will be developed in 
   companion documents. 
    
   We should note that both MPLS and GMPLS protocols can co-exist as 
   "ships in the night" without any interworking issue. This document is 
   mainly addressing interworking to allow transition from MPLS to GMPLS. 
   We should also note that MPLS control plane means MPLS-TE control 
   plane (RSVP-TE, IGP-TE) and not LDP-based control plane. This 
   document does not address the migration from LDP controlled MPLS 
   networks to GMPLS RSVP-TE

3. Motivations for Migration 
    
   Motivations for migration will vary for different service providers. 
   This section is only present to provide background so that the 
   migration discussions may be seen in context. Sections 5 and 6 
   illustrate the migration models and processes by means of some 
   example scenarios. 
    
   Migration of an MPLS capable LSR to include GMPLS capabilities may be 
   performed for one or more reasons. 
    
   - To add all GMPLS functions to an MPLS PSC network. 
   - To pick up specific GMPLS features and operate them within an MPLS  
     PSC network.  
   - To allow interoperation of equipment with new LSRs that only  
     support GMPLS. 
   - To integrate networks that have been under separate administration  
     and where one network utilizes MPLS and another uses GMPLS. 
   - To build integrated PSC and non-PSC networks where the non-PSC  
     networks can only be controlled by GMPLS since MPLS does not  
     operate in non-PSC networks. 
    
4. MPLS to GMPLS migration 
    
4.1. Migration models 
    
   MPLS to GMPLS migration is a process of evolving MPLS-TE-based 
   control plane to GMPLS-based control plane  to GMPLS. Three migration 
   models are considered as described below. Practically speaking, both 
   migration models may be deployed at the same time. 
    
4.1.1. Island model 
    
   In the island model, "islands" of network nodes operating one 
   protocol exist within a "sea" of nodes using the other protocol. 
    

 
                          Expires April 2006               [Page 4] 
 
 
draft-shiomoto-ccamp-mpls-gmpls-interwork-fmwk-00.txt       October 2005 
 
 
   The most obvious example is to consider an island of nodes with GMPLS 
   capability that is introduced into the legacy network. Such an island 
   might be composed of newly added network nodes, or might arise from 
   the upgrade of existing nodes that previously operated MPLS protocols. 
    
   Clearly there is no requirement that an island be GMPLS-capable 
   within an MPLS sea; the opposite is quite possible. That is, there is 
   a possibility that an island happens to be MPLS-capable within an 
   GMPLS sea in some cases. Such situation might arise in the later 
   stages of migration when all but a few islands of MPLS-capable nodes 
   have been upgraded to GMPLS. 
    
   It is also possible that a lower-layer manually-provisioned network 
   (for example, a TDM network) supports an MPLS PSC network. During the 
   process of migrating both networks to GMPLS the situation might arise 
   where the lower-layer network has been migrated and operates GMPLS, 
   but the packet network still operates MPLS. This would appear as a 
   GMPLS island within an MPLS sea. 
    
   Lastly it is possible to consider individual nodes as islands. That 
   is, it would be possible to upgrade or insert an individual GMPLS-
   capable node within an MPLS network, and to treat that GMPLS node as 
   an island. 
    
   Over time, collections of MPLS devices are replaced or upgraded to 
   create new GMPLS islands or to extend existing ones, and distinct 
   GMPLS islands may be joined together until the whole network is 
   GMPLS-capable. 
    
   From a migration interworking point of view, we need to examine how 
   these islands are positioned and how LSPs run between the islands. 
   Four categories of interworking scenarios are considered: (1) MPLS-
   GMPLS-MPLS, (2) GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS, (3) MPLS-GMPLS and (4) GMPLS-MPLS. 
   In each case, the interworking behavior is examined based on whether 
   the GMPLS islands are PSC or non-PSC. These scenarios are considered 
   further in section 5. 
    
   Figure 1 shows an example of the island model for the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS 
   interworking. The model consists of a transit GMPLS island in an MPLS 
   sea. The nodes at the boundary of the GMPLS island (G1, G2, G5, and 
   G6) are referred to as "island border nodes". If the GMPLS island was 
   non-PSC, all nodes except the island border nodes in the GMPLS-based 
   transit island (G3 and G4) would be non-PSC devices, i.e., optical 
   equipment (TDM, LSC, and FSC).

   interworking. 
    
    
4.1.2. Integrated model 
    
   The second model involves a more integrated migration strategy. New 
   devices that are capable of operating both MPLS and GMPLS protocols 
   are introduced into the MPLS network. Further, existing MPLS devices 
   are upgraded to support both MPLS and GMPLS. The network continues to 
   operate providing MPLS services, but where the service can be 
   provided using only GMPLS functionality it may be routed accordingly  
   over only such GMPLS-capable devices and achieve a higher level of 
   functionality by utilizing GMPLS features. Once all devices in the 
   network are GMPLS-capable, the MPLS protocols may be turned off, and 
   no new devices need to support MPLS. 
    
   In this second model the questions to be addressed concern the co-
   existence of the two protocol sets within the network. Actual 
   interworking is not a concern. 
    
   The integrated migration model results in a single network in which 
   both MPLS-capable and GMPLS-capable LSRs co-exist. Some LSRs will be 
   capable of only one protocol, and some of both. The migration 
   strategy here involves introducing GMPLS-capable LSRs into an 
   existing MPLS-capable network until such time as all LSRs are GMPLS-
   capable at which time all MPLS functionality is disabled. Since we 
   are starting with an MPLS network all devices are PSC and there are 
   no interworking issues in the data plane. In the control plane the 
   migration issues concern the separation of MPLS and GMPLS protocols, 
   and the choice of routes that may be signaled with only one protocol. 
    
4.1.3. Phased model 
    
   The phased model introduces GMPLS features and protocol elements into 
   an MPLS network one by one. For example, some object or sub-object 
 
                          Expires April 2006               [Page 6]

   (such as the ERO label sub-object, [RFC3473]) might be introduced 
   into the signaling used by LSRs that are otherwise MPLS-capable. This 
   would produce a kind of hybrid LSR.  
    
   This approach may appear simpler to implement as one is able to 
   quickly and easily pick up key new functions without needing to 
   upgrade their whole protocol implementation.  
    
   The interoperability concerns (LABEL REQUEST and LABEL object, for 
   instance, when speaking about RSVP-TE signaling) are exacerbated by 
   this migration model unless all LSRs in the network are updated 
   simultaneously. Interworking between a hybrid LSR and an unchanged 
   MPLS LSR would put the hybrid in the role of a GMPLS LSR as described 
   in the previous sections, while interworking between a hybrid LSR and 
   a GMPLS LSR puts the hybrid in the role of an MPLS LSR. The potential 
   for different hybrids within the network only serves to complicate 
   matters considerably. Thus the piecemeal migration from MPLS to GMPLS 
   is NOT RECOMMENDED. 
    
4.2. Migration strategies 
    
   An appropriate migration strategy is selected based on various 
   factors including the service provider's network deployment plan, 
   customer demand, available network equipment, etc.  
    
   For PSC networks, the migration strategy involves the selection 
   between the models described in the previous section. The choice will 
   depend upon the final objective (full GMPLS capability or partial 
   upgrade to include specific GMPLS features), and upon the immediate 
   objectives (phased upgrade or staged upgrades). 
    
   For PSC networks supported by non-PSC networks, two basic migration 
   strategies can be considered. In the first strategy, the non-PSC 
   network is made GMPLS-capable first and then the PSC network is 
   migrated to GMPLS. This might arise where, in order to expand the 
   network capacity, GMPLS-based non-PSC sub-networks are introduced 
   into or underneath the legacy MPLS-based networks. Subsequently, the 
   legacy MPLS-based PSC network is migrated to be GMPLS-capable as 
   described in the previous paragraph. Finally the entire network 
   including both PSC and non-PSC nodes is controlled by GMPLS. 
    
   The second strategy for PSC and non-PSC networks is to migrate the 
   PSC network to GMPLS first and then enable GMPLS within the non-PSC 
   network. The PSC network is migrated as described before, and when 
   the entire PSC network is completely converted to GMPLS, GMPLS-based 
   non-PSC devices and networks may be introduced without any issues of 
   interworking between MPLS and GMPLS.

   These migration strategies and the migration models described in the 
   previous section are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Mixtures of 
   all strategies and models could be applied.  The migration models and 
   strategies selected will give rise to one or more of the interworking 
   cases described in the following section. 
    
    
5. Island model interworking cases 
    
    
5.1. MPLS-GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS Islands 
    
   The migration of an MPLS-based packet network to become a GMPLS 
   (PSC)-based network may be performed to provide GMPLS-based advanced 
   features in the network or to facilitate interworking with GMPLS-
   based optical core network. 
    
   The migration may give rise to islands of GMPLS support within a sea 
   of MPLS nodes such that an end-to-end LSP begins and ends on MPLS-
   capable LSRs. The GMPLS PSC island may be used to "hide" islands of 
   GMPLS non-PSC functionality that are completely contained within the 
   GMPLS PSC islands. This would protect the MPLS LSRs from having to be 
   aware of non-PSC technologies. 
    
    
5.2. MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS Islands 
    
   The introduction of a GMPLS-based controlled optical core network to 
   increase the capacity of a MPLS packet network is an example that may 
   give rise to this scenario. Until the MPLS network is upgraded to be 
   GMPLS-capable, the MPLS and GMPLS networks must interwork. The 
   interworking challenges may be reduced by wrapping the non-PSC GMPLS 
   island entirely within a GMPLS PSC island as described in the 
   previous section. 
    
5.3. GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS-GMPLS(PSC) Islands 
    
   This case might arise as the result of installing new GMPLS-capable 
   islands around a legacy MPLS network, or as the result of controlled 
   migration of some islands to become GMPLS-capable. 
    
5.4. GMPLS(non-PSC)-MPLS-GMPLS(non-PSC) Islands 
    
   This case is out of scope for this document. Since the MPLS island is 
   necessarily packet capable (i.e. PSC), this scenario requires that 
   non-PSC LSPs are carried across a PSC network. Such a situation does 
   not arise through simple control plane migration although the

   interworking scenario might occur for other reasons and be supported, 
   for example, by pseudowires. 
    
5.5. GMPLS(PSC)-MPLS and MPLS-GMPLS(PSC) Islands 
    
   This case is likely to arise where the migration strategy is not 
   based on a core infrastructure, but has edge nodes (ingress or 
   egress) located in islands of different capabilities. 
    
   In this case an LSP starts or ends in a GMPLS (PSC) island and 
   correspondingly ends or starts in an MPLS island. Some signaling and 
   routing conversion is required on island border LSRs. Figure 2 shows 
   the reference model for this migration scenario.  Head-end and Tail-
   end LSR are in distinct control plane clouds. 
    
   Since both islands are PSC there is no data plane conversion at the 
   island boundaries. However, from a control plane point of view this 
   model may prove challenging because the protocols must share or 
   convert information between the islands rather than tunnel it across 
   an island.

   It is also important to underline that this scenario is also impacted 
   by the directionality of the LSP establishment. Indeed, a 
   unidirectional packet LSP from R1 to G5 is more easily accommodated 
   at G1 than a bi-directional PSC LSP from G5 to R1.

   Issues of MPLS and GMPLS interworking stem from the difference 
   between MPLS and GMPLS protocols and architecture. These issues are 
   categorized into four groups: 
    (1) control and data plane separation, 
    (2) new features introduced by GMPLS, 
    (3) new methods introduced by GMPLS, and 
    (4) interworking between PSC and non-PSC.  
    
   Note that a GMPLS PSC island may be treated in the same way as an 
   island of non-PSC LSRs, and much can be gained by applying the 
   techniques described in section 6.4 to the other scenarios described 
   here. 
    
6.1. Control and data plane separation 
    
   In MPLS, the control plane traffic (signaling and routing) is carried 
   in-band with data. This means that there is fate sharing between a 
   data link and the control traffic on the link. The control plane 
   keep-alive techniques can be used to detect some data plane failures. 
    
   TDM, LSC, FSC networks do not recognize packet delineation, so in-
   band control channels cannot be terminated, and GMPLS must support 
   dedicated control channels (separated from the data channels). In 
   GMPLS, the control channel can be logically or physically separated 
   (i.e., in-fiber out-of-band or out-of-fiber out-of-bound) from the 
   data channel depending on the capabilities of the network devices and 
   the operational requirements.  
    
   The GMPLS control plane, which is designed to carry the control 
   packets, offers the possibility to use dedicated control channels 
   that must not be used to carry data. This is particularly important 
   when the control channels are of low capacity and are not designed to 
   carry user traffic.  
    
   Since GMPLS introduces a separation between control and data channels, 
   control traffic may use different channels than the data traffic, and 
   this requires new routing and signaling protocol elements (e.g. 
   identification of data channels within the control plane). 
    
    
6.2. New features 
    
   New features introduced by GMPLS and not available in MPLS include 
   bidirectional LSPs, label suggestion, label restriction, graceful 
   restart, and graceful teardown, as well as GMPLS's support of 
   networks with multiple switching capabilities (see [RFC3945]).

6.2.1. Signaling  
    
   GMPLS RSVP-TE signaling ([RFC3471]) introduces new RSVP-TE objects, 
   and their associated procedures, that are not processed/generated by 
   MPLS LSRs. Clearly an MPLS LSR cannot be expected to originate LSPs 
   that use these objects and will, therefore, not have access to the 
   additional GMPLS functions. However, the new RSVP-TE objects listed 
   below will need to be handled in interworking scenarios where the LSP 
   ingress and/or egress is GMPLS-capable, and MPLS LSRs are required to 
   process the signaling messages:  
   o The (Generalized) Label Request object (new C-Type), used to 
     identify the LSP encoding type, the switching type and the 
     generalized protocol ID (G-PID) associated with the LSP.  
   o The (Generalized) Label object (new C-Type) 
   o The IF_ID RSVP_HOP objects, IF_ID ERROR_SPEC objects, and IF_ID 
     ERO/RRO subobjects that handle the Control plane/Data plane 
     separation in GMPLS network.  
   o The Suggested Label Object, used to reduce LSP setup delays.  
   o The Label Set Object, used to restrict label allocation to a set 
     of labels, (particularly useful for wavelength conversion 
     incapable nodes)  
   o The Upstream Label Object, used for bi-directional LSP setup  
   o The Restart Cap object, used for graceful restart.  
   o The Admin Status object, used for LSP administration, and 
     particularly for graceful LSP teardown.  
   o The Recovery Label object used for Graceful Restart  
   o The Notify Request object used to solicit notification of errors 
     and events. 
    
   Future GMPLS extensions are likely to add further new objects. 
    
   Some of these objects can be passed transparently by MPLS LSRs to 
   carry them across MPLS islands because their C-Nums are of the form 
   11bbbbbb, but others will cause an MPLS LSR to reject the message 
   that carries them because their C-Nums are of the form 0bbbbbbb. 
    
   Even when objects are inherited from MPLS by GMPLS they can be 
   expected to cause problems. For example, the Label object in GMPLS 
   uses a new C-Type to indicate ëGeneralized LabelÅE This C-Type is 
   unknown to MPLS LSRs which will reject any message carrying it. 
    
   GMPLS also introduces new message flags and fields (including new 
   sub-objects and TLVs) that will have no meaning to MPLS LSRs. This 
   data will normally be forwarded untouched by transit MPLS LSRs, but 
   they cannot be expected to act on it. 
    
   Also GMPLS introduces two new messages, the Notify message, and the 
   RecoveryPath message that are not supported by MPLS nodes.

   6.2.1.1 Bi-directional LSP 
    
   GMPLS provides bidirectional LSP setup - a single signaling session 
   manages the bidirectional LSP, and forward and reverse data paths 
   follow the same route in the GMPLS network. There is no equivalent in 
   MPLS networks, forward and backward LSPs must be created in different 
   signaling sessions - the route taken by those LSPs may be different 
   from each other, and their sessions are treated differently from each 
   other. Common routes and fate sharing require additional, higher-
   level coordination in MPLS.  
    
   If MPLS and GMPLS networks are inter-connected, bidirectional LSPs 
   from the GMPLS network need to be carried in the MPLS network. 
    
   Note that this issue arises only in the cases where an LSP is 
   originated by GMPLS-capable LSRs. In other words, it applies only to 
   the GMPLS-MPLS-GMPLS island model and to the island migration model. 
    
   In the MPLS-GMPLS-MPLS and MPLS-GMPLS models, the ingress LSR is 
   unaware of the concept of a bidirectional LSP and cannot attempt the 
   service even if it could find some way to request it through the 
   network. In the case of GMPLS-MPLS, a similar issue exists because 
   the egress MPLS-capable LSR is unaware of the concept of 
   bidirectional LSPs and cannot initiate a return LSP. 
    
   Note that the island border LSRs will bear the responsibility for 
   achieving the bidirectional service across the central MPLS island.  
    
6.2.2. Routing  
    
   TE-link information is advertised by the IGP using TE extensions. 
   This allows LSRs to collect topology information for the whole TE 
   network and to store it in the traffic-engineering database (TED). 
   Traffic-engineered explicit routes are calculated using the network 
   graphs derived from the TED. 
    
   GMPLS extends the TE information advertised by the IGPs to include 
   non-PSC information and extended PSC information. Because the GMPLS 
   information is provided as extensions to the MPLS information, MPLS 
   LSRs are able to "see" GMPLS LSRs as though they were PSC LSRs. They 
   will also see other GMPLS information, but will ignore it, passing it 
   transparently across the MPLS network for use by other GMPLS LSRs. 
    
   This means that MPLS LSRs may use the combination of MPLS information 
   advertised by MPLS LSRs and a restricted subset of the information 
   advertised by GMPLS LSRs to compute a traffic-engineered explicit 
   route across a mixed network. However, it is likely that a path

   computation component in an MPLS network will only be aware of MPLS 
   TE information and will not understand concepts such as switching 
   capability type. This may mean that an incorrect path will be 
   computed for an e2e LSP from one MPLS island to another across a 
   GMPLS island if different switching capabilities exist. 
    
6.2.3. New mechanisms  
    
   GMPLS also provides several features in a distinct manner from MPLS. 
   For instance local protection is provided using different mechanisms 
   in MPLS (see [RFC4090]) and GMPLS (see [SEGMENT-RECOVERY]). Local 
   protection of island border nodes may be a particular problem.  
 
6.3. Interworking between PSC and non-PSC 
    
   Three issues of interworking between MPLS-based packet networks and 
   GMPLS-based optical transport network result from the fact that 
   control and data planes are separated in GMPLS-based optical 
   transport networks. These three issues are: 
    (a) Lack of routing and signaling adjacencies, 
    (b) Control plane resource exhaustion, and 
    (c) TE path computation over the border between MPLS and GMPLS  
         domains.  
    
   There are several architectural alternatives for interworking between 
   packet network and optical transport network: overlay, peer and 
   augmented models [RFC3945]. Impacts of each issue on each model are 
   different. 
    
   These issues are explained using an example network shown in Figure 3.

   The ingress MPLS and the egress MPLS domains are interconnected via a 
   GMPLS-based optical network as shown in Fig 3. LSAs in the egress 
   MPLS domain are not advertised in the ingress MPLS domain unless 
   routing adjacencies are established between the IP/MPLS domain and 
   GMPLS domain or unless routing adjacencies are established directly 
   between IP/MPLS domains (overlay model). Therefore the ingress LSR in 
   the ingress MPLS domain is not able to find the egress LSR in the 
   egress MPLS domain. The signaling messages are not passed across the 
   GMPLS domain between the ingress and the egress MPLS domains unless 
   the signaling adjacencies are established between the MPLS domain and 
   the GMPLS domain or directly between MPLS domains (overlay model). 
    
   This issue appears in the augmented and the overlay model when there 
   are no links provided between MPLS domains across the GMPLS domain. 
     
6.3.2. Control plane resource exhaustion 
    
   It is a danger that only arises at a PSC LSR that uses an out of band 
   control channel at the border between MPLS and GMPLS domains. This 
   issue is already mentioned at the head of section 6.1. 
    
   This issue can appear in the peer, the augmented, and the overlay 
   models depending on how the border node handles the data forwarding 
   and manages the address space. 
    
6.3.3. TE path computation over the border between MPLS and GMPLS 
    domains 
    
   If the ingress LSR in the ingress MPLS domain does not understand the 
   GMPLS TE protocols and information elements, it assumes that there is 
   no available TE-path across the GMPLS domain unless MPLS-compatible 
   TE LSAs representing the available TE-paths in the GMPLS domain are 
   advertised into the ingress and egress MPLS domains. 
    
   This issue appears in the peer and the augmented models. 
    
   A different issue, which has very similar results, appears in the 
   overlay model. In the overlay model, mechanism to discover 
   connectivity is out of scope and we need to find connectivity between 
   IP/MPLS domains across the core GMPLS domain. This issue is referred 
   to as the "unknown adjacency" problem.

8. Security Considerations 
    
   Security and confidentiality is often applied (and attacked) at 
   administrative boundaries. Some of the models described in this 
   document introduce such boundaries, for example between MPLS and 
   GMPLS islands. These boundaries offer the possibility of applying or 
   modifying the security as one might when crossing an IGP area or AS 
   boundary, even though these island boundaries might lie within an IGP 
   area or AS. 
    
   No changes are proposed to the security procedures built into MPLS 
   and GMPLS signaling and routing. GMPLS signaling and routing inherit 
   their security mechanisms from MPLS signaling and routing without any 
   changes. Hence, there will be no issues with security in interworking 
   scenarios. Further, since the MPLS and GMPLS signaling and routing 
   security is provided on a hop-by-hop basis, and since all signaling 
   and routing exchanges described in this document for use between any 
   pair of LSRs are either fully MPLS or fully GMPLS, there are no 
   changes necessary to the security procedures.
