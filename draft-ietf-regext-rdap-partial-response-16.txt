       Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Partial Response
               draft-ietf-regext-rdap-partial-response-16

Abstract

   The Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP) does not include
   capabilities to request partial responses.  Servers will only return
   full responses that include all of the information that a client is
   authorized to receive.  A partial response capability that limits the
   amount of information returned, especially in the case of search
   queries, could bring benefits to both clients and servers.  This
   document describes an RDAP query extension that allows clients to
   specify their preference for obtaining a partial response.

1.  Introduction

   The use of partial responses in RESTful API [REST] design is very
   common.  The rationale is quite simple: instead of returning objects
   in API responses with all data fields, only a subset of the fields in
   each result object is returned.  The benefit is obvious: less data
   transferred over the network means less bandwidth usage, faster
   server responses, less CPU time spent both on the server and the
   client, and less memory usage on the client.

   Currently, RDAP does not provide a client with any way to request a
   partial response.  Servers can only provide the client with a full
   response [RFC7483].  Servers cannot limit the amount of information
   returned in a response based on a client's preferences, and this
   creates inefficiencies.

   The protocol described in this specification extends RDAP search
   capabilities to enable partial responses through the provisioning of
   pre-defined sets of fields that clients can submit to an RDAP service

   by adding a new query parameter.  The service is implemented using
   the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) [RFC7230] and the conventions
   described in [RFC7480].

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  RDAP Path Segment Specification

   The path segment defined in this section is an OPTIONAL extension of
   search path segments defined in [RFC7482].  This document defines an
   RDAP query parameter, "fieldSet", whose value is a non-empty string
   identifying a server-defined set of fields returned in place of the
   full response.  The field sets supported by a server are usually
   described in out-of-band documents (e.g., RDAP profile) together with
   other features.  Moreover, this document defines in Section 2.1 an
   in-band mechanism by means of which servers can provide clients with
   a basic information about the supported field sets.

   The following is an example of an RDAP query including the "fieldSet"
   parameter:

   https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=example*.com&fieldSet=afieldset

   This solution can be implemented by RDAP providers with less effort
   than field selection and is easily requested by clients.  The
   considerations that have led to this solution are described in more
   detail in Appendix A.

2.1.  Subsetting Metadata

   According to most advanced principles in REST design, collectively
   known as HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
   [HATEOAS], a client entering a REST application through an initial
   URI should use server-provided links to dynamically discover
   available actions and access the resources it needs.  In this way,
   the client is not required to have prior knowledge of the service
   and, consequently, to hard code the URIs of different resources.
   This allows the server to make URI changes as the API evolves without
   breaking clients.  Definitively, a REST service should be as self-
   descriptive as possible.

   Therefore, servers implementing the query parameter described in this
   specification SHOULD provide additional information in their
   responses about the available field sets.  Such information is
   collected in a new JSON data structure named "subsetting_metadata"
   containing the following properties:

   o  "currentFieldSet": "String" (REQUIRED) either the value of the
      "fieldSet" parameter as specified in the query string, or the
      field set applied by default;

   o  "availableFieldSets": "AvailableFieldSet[]" (OPTIONAL) an array of
      objects, with each element describing an available field set.  The
      AvailableFieldSet object includes the following members:

      *  "name": "String" (REQUIRED) the field set name;
      *  "default": "Boolean" (REQUIRED) whether the field set is
         applied by default.  An RDAP server MUST define only one
         default field set;
      *  "description": "String" (OPTIONAL) a human-readable description
         of the field set;
      *  "links": "Link[]" (OPTIONAL) an array of links as described in
         [RFC8288] containing the query string that applies the field
         set (see Section 2.1.2).

2.1.1.  RDAP Conformance

   Servers returning the "subsetting_metadata" section in their
   responses MUST include "subsetting" in the rdapConformance array.

2.1.2.  Representing Subsetting Links

   An RDAP server MAY use the "links" array of the "subsetting_metadata"
   element to provide ready-made references [RFC8288] to the available
   field sets (Figure 1).  The target URI in each link is the reference
   to an alternative to the current view of results identified by the
   context URI.

   The "value", "rel" and "href" JSON values MUST be specified.  All
   other JSON values are OPTIONAL.

3.  Dealing with Relationships

   Representation of second level objects within a field set produces
   additional considerations.  Since the representation of the topmost
   returned objects will vary according to the field set in use, the
   response may contain no relationships (e.g., for an abbreviated field
   set) or may contain associated objects as in a normal RDAP query
   response.  Each field set can indicate the format of the additional
   objects to be returned, in the same manner that the format of the
   topmost objects is controlled by the field set.

4.  Basic Field Sets

   This section defines three basic field sets which servers MAY
   implement to facilitate their interaction with clients:

   o  "id": the server provides only the key field: "handle" for
      entities, "ldhName" for domains and nameservers.  If a returned
      domain or nameserver is an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN)
      [RFC5890], then the "unicodeName" field MUST additionally be
      included in the response.  This field set could be used when the
      client wants to obtain a collection of object identifiers
      (Figure 2);

   o  "brief": the field set contains the fields that can be included in
      a "short" response.  This field set could be used when the client
      is asking for a subset of the full response which provides only
      basic knowledge of each object;

   o  "full": the field set contains all of the information the server
      can provide for a particular object.

   The "objectClassName" field is implicitly included in each of the
   above field sets.  RDAP providers SHOULD include a "links" field
   indicating the "self" link relationship.  RDAP providers MAY also add
   any property providing service information.

   Fields included in the "brief" and "full" field set responses MUST
   take into account the user's access and authorization levels.

5.  Negative Answers

   Each request including an empty or unsupported "fieldSet" value MUST
   produce an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) response code.  Optionally, the
   response MAY include additional information regarding the supported
   field sets in the HTTP entity body (Figure 3).

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to register the following value in the RDAP
   Extensions Registry:

      Extension identifier: subsetting
      Registry operator: Any
      Published specification: This document.
      Contact: IETF <iesg@ietf.org>
      Intended usage: This extension describes best practice for partial
      response provisioning.

7.  Implementation Status

   NOTE: Please remove this section and the reference to RFC 7942 prior
   to publication as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to RFC 7942, "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

8.  Security Considerations

   A search query typically requires more server resources (such as
   memory, CPU cycles, and network bandwidth) when compared to a lookup
   query.  This increases the risk of server resource exhaustion and
   subsequent denial of service.  This risk can be mitigated by
   supporting the return of partial responses combined with other
   strategies (e.g. restricting search functionality, limiting the rate
   of search requests, and truncating and paging results).

   Support for partial responses gives RDAP operators the ability to
   implement data access control policies based on the HTTP
   authentication mechanisms described in [RFC7481].  RDAP operators can
   vary the information returned in RDAP responses based on a client's
   access and authorization levels.  For example:

   o  the list of fields for each set can differ based on the client's
      access and authorization levels;

   o  the set of available field sets could be restricted based on the
      client's access and authorization levels.

   Servers can also define different result limits according to the
   available field sets, so a more flexible truncation strategy can be
   implemented.  The new query parameter presented in this document

Appendix A.  Approaches to Partial Response Implementation

   Looking at the implementation experiences of partial response offered
   by data providers on the web, two approaches are observed:

   o  the client explicitly describes the data fields to be returned;

   o  the client describes a name identifying a server-defined set of
      data fields.

   The former is more flexible than the latter because clients can
   specify all the data fields they need.  However, it has some
   drawbacks:

   o  fields have to be declared according to a given syntax.  This is a
      simple task when the data structure of the object is flat, but it
      is much more difficult when the object has a tree structure like
      that of a JSON object.  The presence of arrays and deep nested
      objects complicate both the syntax definition of the query and,
      consequently, the processing required on the server side;

   o  clients need to recognize the returned data structure to avoid
      cases when the requested fields are invalid;

   o  the request of some fields might not match the client's access and
      authorization levels.  Clients might request unauthorized fields
      and servers have to define a strategy for responding, such as
      always returning an error response or returning a response that
      ignores the unauthorized fields.

A.1.  Specific Issues Raised by RDAP

   In addition to those listed above, RDAP responses raise some specific
   issues:

   o  relevant entity object information is included in a jCard, but
      such information cannot be easily selected because it is split
      into the items of a jagged array;

   o  RDAP responses contain some properties providing service
      information (e.g. rdapConformance, links, notices, remarks, etc.)
      which are not normally selected but they are just as important.
      They could be returned anyway but, in this case, the server would
      provide unrequested data.

   It is possible to address these issues.  For example, the Catnap
   Query Language [CQL] is a comprehensive expression language that can
   be used to customize the JSON response of a RESTful web service.
   Application of CQL to RDAP responses would explicitly identify the
   output fields that would be acceptable when a few fields are
   requested but it would become very complicated when processing a
   larger number of fields.  In the following, two CQL expressions for a
   domain search query are shown (Figure 4).  In the first, only
   objectClassName and ldhName are requested.  In the second, the fields
   of a possible WHOIS-like response are listed.


   https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=example*.com
           &fields=domainSearchResults(objectClassName,ldhName)

   https://example.com/rdap/domains?name=example*.com
           &fields=domainSearchResults(objectClassName,ldhName,
                   unicodeName,
                   status,
                   events(eventAction,eventDate),
                   entities(objectClassName,handle,roles),
                   nameservers(objectClassName,ldhName))

      Figure 4: Examples of CQL expressions for a domain search query

   The field set approach seems to facilitate RDAP interoperability.
   Servers can define basic field sets which, if known to clients, can

   increase the probability of obtaining a valid response.  The usage of
   field sets makes the query string be less complex.  Moreover, the
   definition of pre-defined sets of fields makes it easier to establish
   result limits.

   Finally, considering that there is no real need for RDAP users to
   have the maximum flexibility in defining all the possible sets of
   logically connected fields (e.g. users interested in domains usually
   need to know the status, the creation date, and the expiry date of
   each domain), the field set approach is preferred.
