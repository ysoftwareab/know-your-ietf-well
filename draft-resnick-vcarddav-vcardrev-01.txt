Internet-Draft                    vCard                    February 2008


1.  Introduction

   Note: This draft contains much of the same text as 2425 and 2426
   which may not be correct.  Those two RFCs have been merged and the
   structure of this draft is what's new.  Some vCard-specific
   suggestions have been added, but for the most part this is still very
   open.  But we'd like to get feedback on the structure mostly so that
   it may be fixed.

   Electronic address books have become ubiquitous.  Their increased
   presense on portable, connected devices as well as the diversity of
   platforms exchanging contact data call for a standard.  This memo
   defines the vCard format, which allows the capture and exchange of
   information normally stored within an address book or directory
   application.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  MIME Type Registration

   To:  ietf-types@iana.org

   Subject:  Registration of media type text/vcard

   Type name:  text

   Subtype name:  vcard

   Required parameters:  none

   Optional parameters:  charset

   Encoding considerations:  The "charset" MIME parameter is interpreted
      as defined in [RFC2046], section 4.1.2.  If it is omitted, the
      default encoding is UTF-8 as defined in [RFC3629].

   Security considerations:  See Section 8.

   Interoperability considerations:  The text/vcard media type is
      intended to identify vCard data of any version.  There are older
      specifications of vCard [RFC2426][oldreference_VCARD] still in
      common use.  While these formats are similar, they are not
      strictly compatible.  In general, it is necessary to inspect the
      value of the VERSION property (see Section 5.7.9) for identifying

      the standard to which a given vCard object conforms.

      In addition, the following media types are known to have been used
      to refer to vCard data.  They should be considered deprecated in
      favor of text/vcard.

      *  text/directory

      *  text/directory; type=vcard

      *  text/x-vcard

   Published specification:  draft-resnick-vcarddav-vcardrev-01

   Applications that use this media type:  They are numerous, diverse,
      and include mail user agents, instant messaging clients, address
      book applications, directory servers, customer relationship
      management software, etc.

   Additional information:

      Magic number(s):

      File extension(s):  .vcf

4.  vCard Format Specification

   The text/vcard MIME content type (hereafter known as "vCard")
   contains contact information, typically pertaining to a single
   contact or group of contacts.  The content consists of one or more
   lines in the format given below.

Internet-Draft                    vCard                    February 2008


4.1.  Line Delimiting and Folding

   Individual lines within vCard are delimited by the [RFC2822] line
   break, which is a CRLF sequence (ASCII decimal 13, followed by ASCII
   decimal 10).  Long logical lines of text can be split into a
   multiple-physical-line representation using the following folding
   technique.  After generating a content line, lines longer than 75
   characters SHOULD be folded.

   A logical line MAY be continued on the next physical line anywhere
   between two characters by inserting a CRLF immediately followed by a
   single white space character (space, ASCII decimal 32, or horizontal
   tab, ASCII decimal 9).  At least one character must be present on the
   folded line.  Any sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single
   white space character is ignored (removed) when processing the
   content type.  For example the line:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.

   can be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long description
      that exists on a long line.

   It could also be represented as:

     DESCRIPTION:This is a long descrip
      tion that exists o
      n a long line.

   The process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation
   of a property definition to its single line representation is called
   unfolding.  Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately
   followed by a white space character (namely HTAB ASCII decimal 9 or
   SPACE ASCII decimal 32) as equivalent to no characters at all (i.e.,
   the CRLF and single white space character are removed).

   Folding is done after any content encoding of a type value.
   Unfolding is done before any decoding of a type value in a content
   line.

4.2.  ABNF Format Definition

   The following ABNF uses the notation of [RFC5234], which also defines
   CRLF, WSP, DQUOTE, VCHAR, ALPHA, and DIGIT.  After the unfolding of
   any folded lines as described above, the syntax for a line of this
   content type is as follows:

   contentline  = name *(";" param) ":" value CRLF
      ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first
      ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
      ; described above.
      ; When generating a content line, lines longer than 75
      ; characters SHOULD be folded according to the folding
      ; procedure described above.

   name         = x-name / iana-token

   iana-token   = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
      ; identifier registered with IANA

   x-name       = "x-" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
      ; Names that begin with "x-" or "X-" are
      ; reserved for experimental use, not intended for released

   param        = param-name "=" param-value *("," param-value)

   param-name   = x-name / iana-token

   param-value  = ptext / quoted-string

   ptext  = *SAFE-CHAR

   contentline  = name *(";" param) ":" value CRLF
      ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first
      ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure
      ; described above.
      ; When generating a content line, lines longer than 75
      ; characters SHOULD be folded according to the folding
      ; procedure described above.

   name         = x-name / iana-token

   iana-token   = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
      ; identifier registered with IANA

   x-name       = "x-" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / "-")
      ; Names that begin with "x-" or "X-" are
      ; reserved for experimental use, not intended for released
      ; products, or for use in bilateral agreements.

   param        = param-name "=" param-value *("," param-value)

   param-value  = ptext / quoted-string

   ptext  = *SAFE-CHAR

   value = *VALUE-CHAR
         / valuespec      ; valuespec defined in section 5.8.4

   A line that begins with a white space character is a continuation of
   the previous line, as described above.  The white space character and
   immediately preceeding CRLF should be discarded when reconstructing
   the original line.  Note that this line-folding convention differs
   from that found in [RFC2822], in that the sequence <CRLF><WSP> found
   anywhere in the content indicates a continued line and should be
   removed.

   Property names and parameter names are case insensitive (e.g., the
   property name "fn" is the same as "FN" and "Fn").  Parameter values
   MAY be case sensitive or case insensitive, depending on their
   definition.

   Each property defined in a vCard instance MAY have multiple values.
   The general rule for encoding multi-valued properties is to simply
   create a new content line for each value (including the property
   name).  However, it should be noted that some value types support
   encoding multiple values in a single content line by separating the
   values with a comma ",".  This approach has been taken for several of
   the content types defined below (date, time, integer, float), for
   space-saving reasons.

4.3.  Value Types

   Lists of values are delimited by a list delimiter, specified by the
   COMMA character (ASCII decimal 44).  A COMMA character in a value
   MUST be escaped with a BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Compound type values are delimited by a field delimiter, specified by
   the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).  A SEMI-COLON in a
   component of a compound property value MUST be escaped with a
   BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).

   Standard value types are defined below.

     valuespec =  text-list
                / URI               ; from Appendix A of [RFC3986]
                / date-list

     time-zone = "Z" / time-numzone

     time-numzome = sign time-hour [":"] time-minute

     utc-offset = ("+" / "-") time-hour ":" time-minute

     iana-valuespec = <a publicly-defined valuetype format, registered
                       with IANA, as defined in section 15 of this
                       document>

   Some specific notes on the value types and formats:

   "text": The "text" value type should be used to identify values that
   contain human-readable text.  The character set in which the text is
   represented is controlled by the "charset" MIME type parameter.  Note
   that there is no way to override this parameter on a per-property
   basis.  As for the language, it is controlled by the "language"
   property parameter defined in Section 4.4.

   Examples for "text":

       this is a text value
       this is one value,this is another
       this is a single value\, with a comma encoded

   A formatted text line break in a text value type MUST be represented
   as the character sequence backslash (ASCII decimal 92) followed by a
   Latin small letter n (ASCII decimal 110) or a Latin capital letter N
   (ASCII decimal 78), that is "\n" or "\N".

   For example a multiple line DESCRIPTION value of:

       Mythical Manager
       Hyjinx Software Division
       BabsCo, Inc.

   could be represented as:

       DESCRIPTION:Mythical Manager\nHyjinx Software Division\n
        BabsCo\, Inc.\n

   demonstrating the \n literal formatted line break technique, the
   CRLF-followed-by-space line folding technique, and the backslash
   escape technique.

   "uri": The "uri" value type should be used to identify values that
   are referenced by a URI (including a Content-ID URI), instead of
   encoded in-line.  These value references might be used if the value
   is too large, or otherwise undesirable to include directly.  The
   format for the URI is as defined in [RFC3986].  Note that the value
   of a property of type "uri" is what the URI points to, not the URI
   itself.

   Examples for "uri":

       http://www.foobar.com/my/picture.jpg
       ldap://ldap.foobar.com/cn=babs%20jensen

   "date", "time", and "date-time": Each of these value types is based
   on a subset of the definitions in [ISO.8601.1988] standard.  Multiple
   "date" and "time" values can be specified using the comma-separated
   notation.

   Examples for "date":

       1985-04-12
       1996-08-05,1996-11-11
       19850412

   Examples for "time":

       10:22:00
       102200
       10:22:00.33
       10:22:00.33Z
       10:22:33,11:22:00
       10:22:00-08:00

   Examples for "date-time":

       1996-10-22T14:00:00Z
       1996-08-11T12:34:56Z
       19960811T123456Z
       1996-10-22T14:00:00Z,1996-08-11T12:34:56Z

   "boolean": The "boolean" value type is used to express boolen values.
   These values are case insensitive.

   Examples:

       TRUE
       false
       True

   "integer": The "integer" value type is used to express signed
   integers in decimal format.  If sign is not specified, the value is
   assumed positive "+".  Multiple "integer" values can be specified
   using the comma-separated notation.

   Examples:

       1234567890
       -1234556790
       +1234556790,432109876

   "float": The "float" value type is used to express real numbers.  If
   sign is not specified, the value is assumed positive "+".  Multiple
   "float" values can be specified using the comma-separated notation.

   Examples:

       20.30
       1000000.0000001
       1.333,3.14

   "binary": The "binary" value type specifies that the type value is
   inline, encoded binary data.  This value type can be specified in the
   PHOTO, LOGO, SOUND, and KEY types.

   If inline encoded binary data is specified, the ENCODING type
   parameter MUST be used to specify the encoding format.  The binary
   data MUST be encoded using the "B" encoding format.  Long lines of
   encoded binary data SHOULD BE folded to 75 characters using the
   folding method defined in Section 4.1.

   "vcard": The "vcard" value type specifies that the type value is

   another vCard.  This value type can be specified in the AGENT
   property.  The value type is defined by this specification.  Since
   each of the type declarations within the vcard value type are being
   specified within a text value themselves, they MUST be terminated
   with the backslash escape sequence "\n" or "\N", instead of the
   normal newline character sequence CRLF.  In addition, any COMMA
   character (ASCII decimal 44), SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59)
   and COLON character (ASCII decimal 58) MUST be escaped with the
   BACKSLASH character (ASCII decimal 92).  For example, with the AGENT
   property a value would be specified as:

       AGENT:BEGIN:VCARD\nFN:Joe Friday\nTEL:+1-919-555-7878\n
        TITLE:Area Administrator\, Assistant\n EMAIL\;TYPE=INTERN\n
        ET:jfriday@host.com\nEND:VCARD\n

   "phone-number": The "phone-number" value type specifies that the type
   value is a telephone number.  This value type can be specified in the
   TEL type.  The value type is a text value that has the special
   semantics of a telephone number as defined in [CCITT.E163.1988] and
   [CCITT.X121.1988].

   "utc-offset": The "utc-offset" value type specifies that the type
   value is a signed offset from UTC.  This value type can be specified
   in the TZ type.

   The value type is an offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
   It is specified as a positive or negative difference in units of
   hours and minutes (e.g., +hh:mm).  The time is specified as a 24-hour
   clock.  Hour values are from 00 to 23, and minute values are from 00
   to 59.  Hour and minutes are 2-digits with high order zeroes required
   to maintain digit count.  The extended format for ISO 8601 UTC
   offsets MUST be used.  The extended format makes use of a colon
   character as a separator of the hour and minute text fields.

4.4.  Pre-defined Parameters

   The following parameters are defined for general use.

   The "language" property parameter is used to identify data in
   multiple languages.  There is no concept of "default" language,
   except as specified by any "Content-Language" MIME header parameter
   that is present.  The value of the "language" property parameter is a
   language tag as defined in Section 2 of [RFC4646].

   The "encoding" property parameter is used to specify an alternate
   encoding for a value.  If the value contains a CRLF, it must be
   encoded, since CRLF is used to separate lines in the content-type
   itself.  Currently, only the "b" encoding is supported.

   The "b" encoding can also be useful for binary values that are mixed
   with other text information in the body part (e.g., a certificate).
   Using a per-value "b" encoding in this case leaves the other
   information in a more readable form.  The encoded base 64 value can
   be split across multiple physical lines by using the line folding
   technique described above.

Internet-Draft                    vCard                    February 2008


   The Content-Transfer-Encoding header field is used to specify the
   encoding used for the body part as a whole.  The "encoding" property
   parameter is used to specify an encoding for a particular value
   (e.g., a certificate).  In this case, the Content-Transfer-Encoding
   header might specify "8bit", while the one certificate value might
   specify an encoding of "b" via an "encoding=b" property parameter.

   The Content-Transfer-Encoding and the encodings of individual
   properties given by the "encoding" property parameter are independent
   of one another.  When encoding a text/vcard body part for
   transmission, individual property encodings are performed first, then
   the entire body part is encoded according to the Content-Transfer-
   Encoding.  When decoding a text/vcard body part, the Content-
   Transfer-Encoding is decoded first, and then any individual
   properties with an "encoding" property parameter are decoded.

   The "value" parameter is optional, and is used to identify the value
   type (data type) and format of the value.  The use of these
   predefined formats is encouraged even if the value parameter is not
   explicity used.  By defining a standard set of value types and their
   formats, existing parsing and processing code can be leveraged.  The
   predefined data type values MUST NOT be repeated in COMMA separated
   value lists except within the N, NICKNAME, ADR and CATEGORIES
   properties.

   Including the value type explicitly as part of each property provides
   an extra hint to keep parsing simple and support more generalized
   applications.  For example a search engine would not have to know the
   particular value types for all of the items for which it is
   searching.  Because the value type is explicit in the definition, the
   search engine could look for dates in any item type and provide
   results that can still be interpreted.

5.  vCard Properties

   What follows is an enumeration of the standard vCard properties.

5.1.  General Properties

5.1.1.  BEGIN

   Purpose:  To denote the beginning of a syntactic entity within a
      text/vcard content-type.

   Value type:  text

Internet-Draft                    vCard                    February 2008


   Special notes:  The content entity MUST begin with the BEGIN property
      with a value of "VCARD".

      The BEGIN type is used in conjunction with the END type to delimit
      an entity containing a related set of properties within an text/
      vcard content-type.  This construct can be used instead of or in
      addition to wrapping separate sets of information inside
      additional MIME headers.  It is provided for applications that
      wish to define content that can contain multiple entities within
      the same text/vcard content-type or to define content that can be
      identifiable outside of a MIME environment.

   Example:

         BEGIN:VCARD

5.1.2.  END

   Purpose:  To denote the end of a syntactic entity within a text/vcard
      content-type.

   Value type:  text

   Special notes:  The content entity MUST end with the END type with a
      value of "VCARD".

      The END type is used in conjunction with the BEGIN type to delimit
      an entity containing a related set of properties within an text/
      vcard content-type.  This construct can be used instead of or in
      addition to wrapping separate sets of information inside
      additional MIME headers.  It is provided for applications that
      wish to define content that can contain multiple entities within
      the same text/vcard content-type or to define content that can be
      identifiable outside of a MIME environment.

   Example:

         END:VCARD

5.1.3.  SOURCE

   Purpose:  To identify the source of directory information contained
      in the content type.

   Value type:  uri

Internet-Draft                    vCard                    February 2008


   Special notes:  The SOURCE property is used to provide the means by
      which applications knowledgable in the given directory service
      protocol can obtain additional or more up-to-date information from
      the directory service.  It contains a URI as defined in [RFC3986]
      and/or other information referencing the vCard to which the
      information pertains.  When directory information is available
      from more than one source, the sending entity can pick what it
      considers to be the best source, or multiple SOURCE properties can
      be included.

   Examples:

         SOURCE:ldap://ldap.host/cn=Babs%20Jensen,%20o=Babsco,%20c=US

         SOURCE:http://directory.example.com/addressbooks/jdoe/
          Jean%20Dupont.vcf

5.1.4.  NAME

   Purpose:  To identify the displayable name of the directory entity to
      which information in the vCard pertains.

   Value type:  text

   Special notes:  The NAME property is used to convey the display name
      of the entity to which the directory information pertains.  Its
      value is the displayable, presentation text associated with the
      source for the vCard, as specified in the SOURCE property.

   Example:

         NAME:Babs Jensen's Contact Information

5.1.5.  KIND

   Purpose:  To specify the kind of object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  The value may be one of: "individual" for a single
      person, "group" for a group of people, "org" for an organization,
      an x-name or an iana-token.  If this property is absent,
      "individual" MUST be assumed as default.

   Example:

         KIND:org
         FN:ABC Marketing
         ORG:ABC\, Inc.;North American Division;Marketing
         END:VCARD

5.2.  Identification Properties

   These types are used to capture information associated with the
   identification and naming of the person or resource associated with
   the vCard.

5.2.1.  FN

   Purpose:  To specify the formatted text corresponding to the name of
      the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  This property is based on the semantics of the X.520
      Common Name attribute.  The property MUST be present in the vCard
      object.

   Example:

         FN:Mr. John Q. Public\, Esq.

5.2.2.  N

   Purpose:  To specify the components of the name of the object the
      vCard represents.

Internet-Draft                    vCard                    February 2008


   Value type:  A single structured text value.  Each component can have
      multiple values.

   Special note:  The structured type value corresponds, in sequence, to
      the Family Name, Given Name, Additional Names, Honorific Prefixes,
      and Honorific Suffixes.  The text components are separated by the
      SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).  Individual text
      components can include multiple text values (e.g., multiple
      Additional Names) separated by the COMMA character (ASCII decimal
      44).  This type is based on the semantics of the X.520 individual
      name attributes.  The property SHOULD be present in the vCard
      object when the name of the object the vCard represents follows
      the X.520 model.

   Examples:

             N:Public;John;Quinlan;Mr.;Esq.

             N:Stevenson;John;Philip,Paul;Dr.;Jr.,M.D.,A.C.P.

5.2.3.  NICKNAME

   Purpose:  To specify the text corresponding to the nickname of the
      object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  One or more text values separated by a COMMA character
      (ASCII decimal 44).

   Special note:  The nickname is the descriptive name given instead of
      or in addition to the one belonging to a person, place, or thing.
      It can also be used to specify a familiar form of a proper name
      specified by the FN or N types.

   Examples:

             NICKNAME:Robbie

             NICKNAME:Jim,Jimmie

5.2.4.  PHOTO

   Purpose:  To specify an image or photograph information that
      annotates some aspect of the object the vCard represents.

   Encoding:  The encoding MUST be reset to "b" using the ENCODING
      parameter in order to specify inline, encoded binary data.  If the
      value is referenced by a URI value, then the default encoding is
      used and no explicit ENCODING parameter is needed.

   Value type:  A single value.  The default is binary value.  It can
      also be reset to uri value.  The uri value can be used to specify
      a value outside of this MIME entity.

   Special notes:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
      specify the graphic image format type.  The TYPE parameter value
      MUST be an image media type as specified in [RFC4288].  The full
      media type name, including the "image/" prefix, should be used.
      However, implementations SHOULD be able to handle bare subtypes.

   Example:

       PHOTO;VALUE=uri:http://www.abc.com/pub/photos
        /jqpublic.gif


       PHOTO;ENCODING=b;TYPE=image/jpeg:MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKo

        <...remainder of "B" encoded binary data...>

5.2.5.  BDAY

   Purpose:  To specify the birth date of the object the vCard
      represents.

   Value type:  The default is a single date value.  It can also be
      reset to a single date-time or text value.

   Examples:

             BDAY:1996-04-15

             BDAY:1953-10-15T23:10:00Z

             BDAY;VALUE=text:circa 1800

5.2.6.  DDAY

   Purpose:  To specify the date of death of the object the vCard
      represents.

   Value type:  The default is a single date value.  It can also be
      reset to a single date-time or text value.

5.2.7.  BIRTH

   Purpose:  To specify the place of birth of the object the vCard
      represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Example:

             BIRTH:Babies'R'Us Hospital

5.2.8.  DEATH

   Purpose:  To specify the place of death of the object the vCard
      represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Example:

             DEATH:Aboard the Titanic\, near Newfoundland

5.2.9.  GENDER

   Purpose:  To specify the gender of the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  The value "M" stands for male while "F" stands for
      female.

   Example:

             GENDER:F

5.3.  Delivery Addressing Properties

   These types are concerned with information related to the delivery
   addressing or label for the vCard object.

5.3.1.  ADR

   Purpose:  To specify the components of the delivery address for the
      vCard object.

   Value type:  A single structured text value, separated by the SEMI-
      COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

   Special notes:  The structured type value consists of a sequence of
      address components.  The component values MUST be specified in
      their corresponding position.  The structured type value
      corresponds, in sequence, to the post office box; the extended
      address (e.g. apartment or suite number); the street address; the
      locality (e.g., city); the region (e.g., state or province); the
      postal code; the country name.  When a component value is missing,
      the associated component separator MUST still be specified.

      The text components are separated by the SEMI-COLON character
      (ASCII decimal 59).  Where it makes semantic sense, individual
      text components can include multiple text values (e.g., a "street"
      component with multiple lines) separated by the COMMA character
      (ASCII decimal 44).

      The type can include the type parameter "TYPE" to specify the
      delivery address type.  The TYPE parameter values can include
      "home" to indicate a delivery address for a residence; "work" to
      indicate delivery address for a place of work; and "pref" to
      indicate the preferred delivery address when more than one address
      is specified.  These type parameter values can be specified as a
      parameter list (i.e., "TYPE=home;TYPE=pref") or as a value list
      (i.e., "TYPE=home,pref").  This type is based on semantics of the
      X.520 geographical and postal addressing attributes.  The default
      is "TYPE=work".

   Example: In this example the post office box and the extended address
   are absent.

           ADR;TYPE=home:;;123 Main Street;Any Town;CA;91921-1234

5.3.2.  LABEL

   Purpose:  To specify the formatted text corresponding to delivery
      address of the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  The property value is formatted text that can be used
      to present a delivery address label for the vCard object.  The
      type can include the type parameter "TYPE" to specify delivery
      label type.  The TYPE parameter values can include "home" to
      indicate a delivery label for a residence; "work" to indicate
      delivery label for a place of work; and "pref" to indicate the
      preferred delivery label when more than one label is specified.

5.4.  Communications Properties

   These properties are concerned with information associated with the
   way communications with the object the vCard represents are carried
   out.

5.4.1.  TEL

   Purpose:  To specify the telephone number for telephony communication
      with the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single phone-number value.

   Special notes:  The value of this property is specified in a
      canonical form in order to specify an unambiguous representation
      of the globally unique telephone endpoint.  This property is based
      on the X.500 Telephone Number attribute.

      The property can include the parameter "TYPE" to specify intended
      use for the telephone number.  The TYPE parameter values can
      include: "home" to indicate a telephone number associated with a
      residence, "msg" to indicate the telephone number has voice
      messaging support, "work" to indicate a telephone number
      associated with a place of work, "pref" to indicate a preferred-
      use telephone number, "voice" to indicate a voice telephone
      number, "fax" to indicate a facsimile telephone number, "cell" to
      indicate a cellular telephone number, "video" to indicate a video
      conferencing telephone number, "pager" to indicate a paging device
      telephone number, "bbs" to indicate a bulletin board system
      telephone number, "modem" to indicate a MODEM connected telephone
      number, "car" to indicate a car-phone telephone number, "isdn" to
      indicate an ISDN service telephone number, "pcs" to indicate a
      personal communication services telephone number.  The default
      type is "voice".  These type parameter values can be specified as
      a parameter list (i.e., "TYPE=work;TYPE=voice") or as a value list
      (i.e., "TYPE=work,voice").  The default can be overridden to
      another set of values by specifying one or more alternate values.
      For example, the default TYPE of "voice" can be reset to a WORK
      and HOME, VOICE and FAX telephone number by the value list

      "TYPE=work,home,voice,fax".

   Example:

           TEL;TYPE=work,voice,pref,msg:+1-213-555-1234

5.4.2.  EMAIL

   Purpose:  To specify the electronic mail address for communication
      with the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  The type can include the type parameter "TYPE" to
      specify the format or preference of the electronic mail address.
      The TYPE parameter values can include: "internet" to indicate an
      Internet addressing type, "x400" to indicate a X.400 addressing
      type, "uri" to indicate a URI useable for electronic

      residence, "work" to indicate an address associated with a place
      of work, or "pref" to indicate a preferred-use email address when
      more than one is specified.  Another IANA registered address type
      can also be specified.  The default email type is "internet".  A
      non-standard value can also be specified.

   Type example:

           EMAIL;TYPE=internet:jqpublic@xyz.dom1.com

           EMAIL;TYPE=internet,pref:jane_doe@abc.com

           EMAIL;TYPE=uri,work:http://example.com/contact.php

5.4.3.  IMPP

   Purpose:  To specify the URI for instant messaging and presence
      protocol communications with the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single URI.  The type of the URI indicates the
      protocol that can be used for this contact.

   Special notes:  The property may include the type parameter "TYPE" to
      specify an intended use for the URI.  The TYPE parameter values
      include one or more of the following:

      *  An indication of the type of communication for which this URI
         is appropriate.  This can be a value of "personal" or
         "business".

      *  An indication of the location of a device associated with this
         URI.  Values can be "home", "work", or "mobile".

      *  The value "pref" indicates this is a preferred address and has
         the same semantics as the "pref" value in a TEL property.

   Example:

       IMPP;TYPE=personal,pref:xmpp:alice@example.com

5.4.4.  LANG

   Purpose:  To specify the language(s) that may be used for contacting
      the individual associated with the vCard.

   Value type:  A list of text values.

   Special notes:  The list is to be interpreted as defined in
      [RFC2616], Section 14.4, i.e. as the value of an Accept-Language
      HTTP header.  This lets one specify preference among languages.
      Note that any SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59) must be
      escaped.

   Example:

       LANG:fr,en\;q=0.9

5.5.  Geographical Properties

   These properties are concerned with information associated with
   geographical positions or regions associated with the object the
   vCard represents.

5.5.1.  TZ

   Purpose:  To specify information related to the time zone of the
      object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  The default is a single utc-offset value.  It can also
      be reset to a single text value.

   Special notes:  The type value consists of a single value.

   Type examples:

           TZ:-05:00

           TZ;VALUE=text:-05:00; EST; Raleigh/North America

           ;This example has a single value, not a structure text value.

5.5.2.  GEO

   Purpose:  To specify information related to the global positioning of
      the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single structured value consisting of two float values
      separated by the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

   Special notes:  This property specifies information related to the
      global position of the object associated with the vCard.  The
      value specifies latitude and longitude, in that order (i.e., "LAT
      LON" ordering).  The longitude represents the location east and
      west of the prime meridian as a positive or negative real number,
      respectively.  The latitude represents the location north and
      south of the equator as a positive or negative real number,
      respectively.  The longitude and latitude values MUST be specified
      as decimal degrees and should be specified to six decimal places.
      This will allow for granularity within a meter of the geographical
      position.  The text components are separated by the SEMI-COLON
      character (ASCII decimal 59).  The simple formula for converting
      degrees-minutes-seconds into decimal degrees is:


           decimal = degrees + minutes/60 + seconds/3600.

   Example:

           GEO:37.386013;-122.082932

5.6.  Organizational Properties

   These properties are concerned with information associated with
   characteristics of the organization or organizational units of the
   object the vCard represents.

5.6.1.  TITLE

   Purpose:  To specify the job title, functional position or function
      of the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  This property is based on the X.520 Title attribute.

   Example:

           TITLE:Director\, Research and Development

5.6.2.  ROLE

   Purpose:  To specify information concerning the role, occupation, or
      business category of the object the vCard represents.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  This property is based on the X.520 Business Category
      explanatory attribute.  This property is included as an
      organizational type to avoid confusion with the semantics of the
      TITLE property and incorrect usage of that property when the
      semantics of this property is intended.

   Example:

           ROLE:Programmer

5.6.3.  LOGO

   Purpose:  To specify a graphic image of a logo associated with the
      object the vCard represents.

   Encoding:  The encoding MUST be reset to "b" using the ENCODING
      parameter in order to specify inline, encoded binary data.  If the
      value is referenced by a URI value, then the default encoding of
      8bit is used and no explicit ENCODING parameter is needed.

   Value type:  A single value.  The default is binary value.  It can
      also be reset to uri value.  The uri value can be used to specify
      a value outside of this MIME entity.

   Special notes:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
      specify the graphic image format type.  The TYPE parameter value
      MUST be an image media type as specified in [RFC4288].  The full
      media type name, including the "image/" prefix, should be used.
      However, implementations SHOULD be able to handle bare subtypes.

   Example:

         LOGO;VALUE=uri:http://www.abc.com/pub/logos/abccorp.jpg

         LOGO;ENCODING=b;TYPE=image/jpeg:MIICajCCAdOgAwIBAgICBEUwDQYJKoZ

5.6.4.  AGENT

   Purpose:  To specify information about another person who will act on
      behalf of the individual or resource associated with the vCard.

   Value type:  The default is a single vcard value.  It can also be
      reset to either a single text or uri value.  The text value can be
      used to specify textual information.  The uri value can be used to
      specify information outside of this MIME entity.

   Special notes:  This property typically is used to specify an area
      administrator, assistant, or secretary for the individual
      associated with the vCard.  A key characteristic of the AGENT
      property is that it represents somebody or something that is
      separately addressable.

   Example:

           AGENT;VALUE=uri:
            CID:JQPUBLIC.part3.960129T083020.xyzMail@host3.com

            1234\nEMAIL\;INTERNET:sthomas@host.com\nEND:VCARD\n

5.6.5.  ORG

   Purpose:  To specify the organizational name and units associated
      with the vCard.

   Value type:  A single structured text value consisting of components
      separated the SEMI-COLON character (ASCII decimal 59).

   Special notes:  The property is based on the X.520 Organization Name
      and Organization Unit attributes.  The property value is a
      structured type consisting of the organization name, followed by
      one or more levels of organizational unit names.

   Example: A property value consisting of an organizational name,
   organizational unit #1 name and organizational unit #2 name.

           ORG:ABC\, Inc.;North American Division;Marketing

5.7.  Explanatory Properties

   These properties are concerned with additional explanations, such as
   that related to informational notes or revisions specific to the
   vCard.

5.7.1.  CATEGORIES

   Purpose:  To specify application category information about the
      vCard.

   Value type:  One or more text values separated by a COMMA character
      (ASCII decimal 44).

   Example:

           CATEGORIES:TRAVEL AGENT

           CATEGORIES:INTERNET,IETF,INDUSTRY,INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

5.7.2.  NOTE

   Purpose:  To specify supplemental information or a comment that is
      associated with the vCard.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  The property is based on the X.520 Description
      attribute.

   Example:

           NOTE:This fax number is operational 0800 to 1715
             EST\, Mon-Fri.

5.7.3.  PRODID

   Purpose:  To specify the identifier for the product that created the
      vCard object.

   Type value:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  Implementations SHOULD use a method such as that
      specified for Formal Public Identifiers in [ISO9070] or for
      Universal Resource Names in [RFC3406] to assure that the text
      value is unique.

5.7.4.  REV

   Purpose:  To specify revision information about the current vCard.

   Value type:  The default is a single date-time value.  Can also be
      reset to a single date value.

   Special notes:  The value distinguishes the current revision of the
      information in this vCard for other renditions of the information.

   Example:

           REV:1995-10-31T22:27:10Z

           REV:1997-11-15

5.7.5.  SORT-STRING

   Purpose:  To specify the family name or given name text to be used
      for national-language-specific sorting of the FN and N types.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  The sort string is used to provide family name or
      given name text that is to be used in locale- or national-
      language- specific sorting of the formatted name and structured
      name types.  Without this information, sorting algorithms could
      incorrectly sort this vCard within a sequence of sorted vCards.
      When this property is present in a vCard, then this family name or
      given name value is used for sorting the vCard.

   Examples: For the case of family name sorting, the following examples
   define common sort string usage with the FN and N properties.

5.7.6.  SOUND

   Purpose:  To specify a digital sound content information that
      annotates some aspect of the vCard.  By default this property is
      used to specify the proper pronunciation of the name property
      value of the vCard.

   Encoding:  The encoding MUST be reset to "b" using the ENCODING
      parameter in order to specify inline, encoded binary data.  If the
      value is referenced by a URI value, then the default encoding of
      8bit is used and no explicit ENCODING parameter is needed.

   Value type:  A single value.  The default is binary value.  It can
      also be reset to uri value.  The uri value can be used to specify
      a value outside of this MIME entity.

   Special notes:  This property SHOULD include the parameter "TYPE" to
      specify the audio format type.  The TYPE parameter value MUST be
      an audio media type as specified in [RFC4288].  The full media

5.8.  Security Properties

   These properties are concerned with the security of communication
   pathways or access to the vCard.

5.8.1.  CLASS

   Purpose:  To specify the access classification for a vCard object.

   Value type:  A single text value.

   Special notes:  An access classification is only one component of the
      general security model for a directory service.  The
      classification attribute provides a method of capturing the intent
      of the owner for general access to information described by the
      vCard object.

   Examples:

           CLASS:PUBLIC

           CLASS:PRIVATE

           CLASS:CONFIDENTIAL

5.8.2.  KEY

5.9.  Extended Properties and Parameters

   The properties and parameters defined by this document can be
   extended.  Non-standard, private properties and parameters with a
   name starting with "X-" may be defined bilaterally between two
   cooperating agents without outside registration or standardization.

6.  Formal Grammar

   The following formal grammar is provided to assist developers in
   building parsers for the vCard.

   This syntax is written according to the form described in [RFC5234],
   but it references just this small subset of [RFC5234] literals:

8.  Security Considerations

   o  Internet mail is subject to many well known security attacks,
      including monitoring, replay, and forgery.  Care should be taken
      by any directory service in allowing information to leave the
      scope of the service itself, where any access controls can no
      longer be guaranteed.  Applications should also take care to
      display directory data in a "safe" environment (e.g., PostScript-
      valued types).

   o  vCards can carry cryptographic keys or certificates, as described
      in Section 5.8.2.

   o  Section 5.8.1 specifies a desired security classification policy
      for a particular vCard.  That policy is not enforced in any way.

   o  The vCard objects have no inherent authentication or privacy, but
      can easily be carried by any security mechanism that transfers
      MIME objects with authentication or privacy.  In cases where
      threats of "spoofed" vCard information is a concern, the vCard
      SHOULD BE transported using one of these secure mechanisms.

   o  The information in a vCard may become out of date.  In cases where
      the vitality of data is important to an originator of a vCard, the
      "URL" type described in Section 5.7.8 SHOULD BE specified.  In
      addition, the "REV" type described in section Section 5.7.4 can be
      specified to indicate the last time that the vCard data was
      updated.

Appendix A.  Differences from RFCs 2425 and 2426

   This appendix contains a list of changes that have been made in the
   vCard specification from RFCs 2425 and 2426.

A.1.  New Structure

   o  [RFC2425] and [RFC2426] have been merged.  Initially [RFC2425] was
      intended to be extensible but only 2426 ever extended it.

   o  vCard is now not only a MIME type but a stand-alone format.

   o  A proper MIME type registration form has been included.

   o  UTF-8 is now the default character set.

A.2.  Removed Features

   o  The group construct (i.e.  GROUP.PROPERTY:...) no longer exists.

   o  The CONTEXT and CHARSET parameters are no more.

   o  The MAILER property is no more.

   o  The "intl", "dom", "postal", and "parcel" TYPE parameter values
      for the ADR and LABEL properties have been removed.

A.3.  New Properties and Parameters

   o  The KIND, GENDER, LANG, DDAY, BIRTH, and DEATH properties have
      been added.

   o  [RFC4770], which defines the IMPP property, has been merged in.

   o  The "work", "home", and "uri" TYPE parameter values for the EMAIL
      property have been added.

A.4.  Other Changes

   o  The N property is no longer mandatory.

Appendix B.  Change Log (to be removed by RFC Editor prior to
             publication)

B.1.  Changes in -01

   o  Removed reference to RFC 2234.

   o  Fixed errata from
      http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=2426.

   o  Removed passage referring to RFC 2425 profiles.

   o  Renamed Section 5.4 from "Telecommunications Adressing Properties"
      to "Communications Properties.

   o  Added Appendix A and Appendix B.

   o  Added reference to [RFC4770].

   o  Removed the group construct.

   o  Made the N property no longer mandatory.

   o  Added the KIND property.

   o  Clarified meaning of TYPE parameter value for PHOTO, LOGO, KEY,
      and SOUND.

   o  Removed the CONTEXT parameter.

   o  Removed the MAILER property.

   o  Made reference to [ISO9070] informative.

   o  Removed "intl", "dom", "postal", and "parcel" TYPE parameter
      values for the ADR and LABEL properties.

   o  Clarified meaning of "extended address" ADR field.

   o  Mentioned [RFC3406] as another method of generating PRODID values.

Internet-Draft                    vCard                    February 2008


   o  Allowed BDAY and DDAY value types to be text values for fuzzy
      dates.

   o  Removed the CHARSET property.  Now the encoding is always UTF-8,
      except when overridden by the Content-Type (which is considered a
      compatibility feature).
