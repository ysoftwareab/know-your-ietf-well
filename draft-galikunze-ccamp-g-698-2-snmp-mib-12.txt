An SNMP MIB extension to RFC3591 to manage optical interface parameters
            of "G.698.2 single channel" in DWDM applications
               draft-galikunze-ccamp-g-698-2-snmp-mib-12

Abstract

   This memo defines a module of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) in TCP/IP- based
   internet.  In particular, it defines objects for managing single
   channel optical interface parameters of DWDM applications, using the
   approach specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] .  This interface,
   described in ITU-T G.872, G.709 and G.798, is one type of OTN multi-
   vendor Intra-Domain Interface (IaDI).  This RFC is an extension of
   RFC3591 to support the optical parameters specified in ITU-T G.698.2
   and application identifiers specified in ITU-T G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1].
   Note that G.874.1 encompasses vendor-specific codes, which if used
   would make the interface a single vendor IaDI and could still be
   managed.

   The MIB module defined in this memo can be used for Optical
   Parameters monitoring and/or configuration of the endpoints of the
   multi-vendor IaDI based on the Black Link approach.

1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   used by Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)in TCP/IP-based
   internets.  In particular, it defines objects for managing single
   channel optical interface parameters of DWDM applications, using the
   approach specified in G.698.2.  This RFC is an extension of RFC3591
   to support the optical parameters specified in ITU-T G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2] and application identifiers specified in ITU-T G.874.1
   [ITU.G874.1] .  Note that G.874.1 encompasses vendor-specific codes,
   which if used would make the interface a single vendor IaDI and could
   still be managed.

   The Black Link approach allows supporting an optical transmitter/
   receiver pair of one vendor to inject an optical tributary signal and
   run it over an optical network composed of amplifiers, filters, add-
   drop multiplexers from a different vendor.  In the OTN architecture,
   the 'black-link' represents a pre-certified network media channel
   conforming to G.698.2 specifications at the S and R reference points.

   [Editor's note: In G.698.2 this corresponds to the optical path from
   point S to R; network media channel is also used and explained in
   draft-ietf-ccamp-flexi-grid-fwk-02]

   Management will be performed at the edges of the network media
   channel (i.e., at the transmitters and receivers attached to the S
   and R reference points respectively) for the relevant parameters
   specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2], G.798 [ITU.G798], G.874
   [ITU.G874], and the performance parameters specified in G.7710/Y.1701
   [ITU-T G.7710] and G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1].

   G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] is primarily intended for metro applications
   that include optical amplifiers.  Applications are defined in G.698.2
   [ITU.G698.2] using optical interface parameters at the single-channel
   connection points between optical transmitters and the optical
   multiplexer, as well as between optical receivers and the optical
   demultiplexer in the DWDM system.  This Recommendation uses a
   methodology which does not explicitly specify the details of the
   optical network between reference point Ss and Rs, e.g., the passive

   and active elements or details of the design.  The Recommendation
   currently includes unidirectional DWDM applications at 2.5 and 10
   Gbit/s (with 100 GHz and 50 GHz channel frequency spacing).  Work is
   still under way for 40 and 100 Gbit/s interfaces.  There is
   possibility for extensions to a lower channel frequency spacing.
   This document specifically refers to the "application code" defined
   in the G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] and included in the Application
   Identifier defined in G.874.1 [ITU.G874.1] and G.872 [ITU.G872], plus
   a few optical parameters not included in the G.698.2 application code
   specification.

   This draft refers and supports also the draft-kunze-g-698-2-
   management-control-framework

   The building of an SNMP MIB describing the optical parameters defined
   in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2], and reflected in G.874.1 [ITU.G874], allows
   the different vendors and operator to retrieve, provision and
   exchange information across the G.698.2 multi-vendor IaDI in a
   standardized way.

   The MIB, reporting the Optical parameters and their values,
   characterizes the features and the performances of the optical
   components and allow a reliable black link design in case of multi
   vendor optical networks.

   Although RFC 3591 [RFC3591] describes and defines the SNMP MIB of a
   number of key optical parameters, alarms and Performance Monitoring,
   as this RFC is over a decade old, it is primarily pre-OTN, and a more
   complete and up-to-date description of optical parameters and
   processes can be found in the relevant ITU-T Recommendations.  The
   same considerations can be applied to the RFC 4054 [RFC4054]

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

4.  Overview

   Figure 1 shows a set of reference points, for the linear "black link"
   approach, for single-channel connection (Ss and Rs) between
   transmitters (Tx) and receivers (Rx).  Here the DWDM network elements
   include an OM and an OD (which are used as a pair with the opposing
   element), one or more optical amplifiers and may also include one or
   more OADMs.

   G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] defines also Ring "Black Link" approach
   configurations [Fig. 5.2/G.698.2] and Linear "black link" approach
   for Bidirectional applications[Fig. 5.3/G.698.2]

4.1.  Use Cases

   The use cases described below are assuming that power monitoring
   functions are available in the ingress and egress network element of
   the DWDM network, respectively.  By performing link property
   correlation it would be beneficial to include the current transmit
   power value at reference point Ss and the current received power
   value at reference point Rs.  For example if the Client transmitter
   power (OXC1) has a value of 0dBm and the ROADM interface measured
   power (at OLS1) is -6dBm the fiber patch cord connecting the two
   nodes may be pinched or the connectors are dirty.  More, the
   interface characteristics can be used by the OLS network Control
   Plane in order to check the Optical Channels feasibility.  Finally
   the OXC1 transceivers parameters (Application Code) can be shared
   with OXC2 using the LMP protocol to verify the Transceivers
   compatibility.  The actual route selection of a specific wavelength
   within the allowed set is outside the scope of LMP.  In GMPLS, the
   parameter selection (e.g. central frequency) is performed by RSVP-TE.

   G.698.2 defines a single channel optical interface for DWDM systems
   that allows interconnecting network-external optical transponders
   across a DWDM network.  The optical transponders are considered to be
   external to the DWDM network.  This so-called 'black link' approach
   illustrated in Figure 5-1 of G.698.2 and a copy of this figure is
   provided below.  The single channel fiber link between the Ss/Rs
   reference points and the ingress/egress port of the network element
   on the domain boundary of the DWDM network (DWDM border NE) is called
   access link in this contribution.  Based on the definition in G.698.2
   it is considered to be part of the DWDM network.  The access link
   typically is realized as a passive fiber link that has a specific
   optical attenuation (insertion loss).  As the access link is an
   integral part of the DWDM network, it is desirable to monitor its
   attenuation.  Therefore, it is useful to detect an increase of the
   access link attenuation, for example, when the access link fiber has
   been disconnected and reconnected (maintenance) and a bad patch panel
   connection (connector) resulted in a significantly higher access link
   attenuation (loss of signal in the extreme case of an open connector
   or a fiber cut).  In the following section, two use cases are
   presented and discussed:

        1) pure access link monitoring
        2) access link monitoring with a power control loop

   These use cases require a power monitor as described in G.697 (see
   section 6.1.2), that is capable to measure the optical power of the
   incoming or outgoing single channel signal.  The use case where a
   power control loop is in place could even be used to compensate an
   increased attenuation as long as the optical transmitter can still be
   operated within its output power range defined by its application
   code.

   Pure Access Link  (AL) Monitoring Use Case

   Figure 4 illustrates the access link monitoring use case and the
   different physical properties involved that are defined below:

    - Ss, Rs: G.698.2 reference points
    - P(Tx):  current optical output power of transmitter Tx
    - a(Tx):  access link attenuation in Tx direction (external
              transponder point of view)
    - P(in):  measured current optical input power at the input port
              of border DWDM NE
    - t:      user defined threshold (tolerance)
    - P(out): measured current optical output power at the output
              port of border DWDM NE
    - a(Rx):  access link attenuation in Rx direction (external
              transponder point of view)
    - P(Rx):  current optical input power of receiver Rx

   Assumptions:
    - The access link attenuation in both directions (a(Tx), a(Rx))
      is known or can be determined as part of the commissioning
      process.  Typically, both values are the same.
    - A threshold value t has been configured by the operator. This
      should also be done during commissioning.
    - A control plane protocol is in place that allows
      to periodically send the optical power values P(Tx) and P(Rx)
      to the control plane protocol instance on the DWDM border NE.
      This is llustrated in Figure 3.
    - The DWDM border NE is capable to periodically measure the optical
      power Pin and Pout as defined in G.697 by power monitoring points
      depicted as yellow triangles in the figures below.

   AL monitoring process:
    - Tx direction: the measured optical input power Pin is compared
      with the expected optical input power P(Tx) - a(Tx). If the
      measured optical input power P(in) drops below the value
      (P(Tx) - a(Tx) - t) a low power alarm shall be raised indicating
      that the access link attenuation has exceeded a(Tx) + t.
    - Rx direction: the measured optical input power P(Rx) is
      compared with the expected optical input power P(out) - a(Rx).
      If the measured optical input power P(Rx) drops below the value
      (P(out) - a(Rx) - t) a
      low power alarm shall be raised indicating that the access link
      attenuation has exceeded a(Rx) + t.

   Power Control Loop Use Case

     This use case is based on the access link monitoring use case as
     described above. In addition, the border NE is running a power
     control application that is capable to control the optical output
     power of the single channel tributary signal at the output port
     of the border DWDM NE (towards the external receiver Rx) and the
     optical output power of the single channel tributary signal at
     the external transmitter Tx within their known operating range.
     The time scale of this control loop is typically relatively slow
     (e.g. some 10s or minutes) because the access link attenuation
     is not expected to vary much over time (the attenuation only
     changes when re-cabling occurs).
     From a data plane perspective, this use case does not require
     additional data plane extensions. It does only require a protocol
     extension in the control plane (e.g. this LMP draft) that allows
     the power control application residing in the DWDM border NE to
     modify the optical output power of the DWDM domain-external
     transmitter Tx within the range of the currently used application
     code. Figure 5 below illustrates this use case utilizing the LMP
     protocol with extensions defined in this draft.

4.2.  Optical Parameters Description

   The G.698.2 pre-certified network media channels are managed at the
   edges, i.e. at the transmitters (Tx) and receivers (Rx) attached to
   the S and R reference points respectively.  The set of parameters
   that could be managed are specified in G.698.2 [ITU.G698.2] section
   5.3 referring the "application code" notation

   The definitions of the optical parameters are provided below to
   increase the readability of the document, where the definition is
   ended by (G) the parameter can be retrieve with a GET, when (S) it
   can be provisioned by a SET, (G,S) can be either GET and SET.

   To support the management of these parameters, the SNMP MIB in RFC
   3591 [RFC3591] is extended with a new MIB module defined in section 6
   of this document.  This new MIB module includes the definition of new
   configuration table of the OCh Layer for the parameters at Tx (S) and
   Rx (R).

4.2.1.  Rs-Ss Configuration

   The Rs-Ss configuration table allows configuration of Central
   Frequency, Power and Application identifiers as described in
   [ITU.G698.2] and G.694.1 [ITU.G694.1]
   This parameter report the current Transceiver Output power, it can be
   either a setting and measured value (G, S).

   Central frequency (see G.694.1 Table 1):
      This parameter indicates the central frequency value that Ss and
      Rs will be set, to work (in THz), in particular Section 6/G.694.1
      (G, S).

   Single-channel application identifiers (see G.698.2):
      This parameter indicates the transceiver application identifier at
      Ss and Rs as defined in [ITU.G698.2] Chapter 5.4 - this parameter
      can be called Optical Interface Identifier OII as per [draft-
      martinelli-wson-interface-class] (G).

   Number of Single-channel application identifiers Supported
      This parameter indicates the number of Single-channel application
      codes supported by this interface (G).

   Current Laser Output power:
      This parameter report the current Transceiver Output power, see
      RFC3591.

   Current Laser Input power:

4.3.  Use of ifTable

   This section specifies how the MIB II interfaces group, as defined in
   RFC 2863 [RFC2863], is used for the link ends of a black link.  Only
   the ifGeneralInformationGroup will be supported for the ifTable and
   the ifStackTable to maintain the relationship between the OCh and OPS
   layers.  The OCh and OPS layers are managed in the ifTable using
   IfEntries that correlate to the layers depicted in Figure 1.

   For example, a device with TX and/or RX will have an Optical Physical
   Section (OPS) layer, and an OCh layer.  There is a one to n
   relationship between the OPS and OCh layers.

   EDITOR NOTE: Reason for changing from OChr to OCh: Edition 3 of G.872
   removed OChr from the architecture and G.709 was subsequently updated
   to account for this architectural change.

   Figure 5 In the following figures, opticalPhysicalSection are
   abbreviated as OPS.

   The design of the Optical Interface MIB provides the option to model
   an interface either as a single bidirectional object containing both
   sink and source functions or as a pair of unidirectional objects, one
   containing sink functions and the other containing source functions.

   If the sink and source for a given protocol layer are to be modelled
   as separate objects, then there need to be two ifTable entries, one
   that corresponds to the sink and one that corresponds to the source,
   where the directionality information is provided in the configuration
   tables for that layer via the associated Directionality objects.  The
   agent is expected to maintain consistent directionality values
   between ifStackTable layers (e.g., a sink must not be stacked in a
   1:1 manner on top of a source, or vice-versa), and all protocol
   layers that are represented by a given ifTable entry are expected to
   have the same directionality.

   When separate ifTable entries are used for the source and sink
   functions of a given physical interface, association between the two
   uni-directional ifTable entries (one for the source function and the
   other for the sink functions) should be provided.  It is recommended
   that identical ifName values are used for the two ifTable entries to
   indicate such association.  An implementation shall explicitly state
   what mechanism is used to indicate the association, if ifName is not
   used.

     ifSpeed           Actual bandwidth of the interface in bits per
                       second.  If the bandwidth of the interface is
                       greater than the maximum value of 4,294,967,295
                       then the maximum value is reported and
                       ifHighSpeed must be used to report the
                       interface's speed.

     ifPhysAddress     An octet string with zero length.  (There is
                       no specific address associated with the
                       interface.)

     ifAdminStatus     The desired administrative state of the
                       interface.  Supports read-only access.

     ifOperStatus      The operational state of the interface.  The
                       value lowerLayerDown(7) is not used, since
                       there is no lower layer interface.  This object
                       is set to notPresent(6) if a component is
                       missing, otherwise it is set to down(2) if
                       either of the objects optIfOPSnCurrentStatus
                       indicates that any defect is present.

     ifLastChange      The value of sysUpTime at the last change in
                       ifOperStatus.

     ifName            Enterprise-specific convention (e.g., TL-1 AID)
                       to identify the physical or data entity
                       associated with this interface or an
                       OCTET STRING of zero length.  The
                       enterprise-specific convention is intended to
                       provide the means to reference one or more
                       enterprise-specific tables.

     ifLinkUpDownTrapEnable  Default value is enabled(1).  Supports
                             read-only access.

     ifHighSpeed       Actual bandwidth of the interface in Mega-bits
                       per second.  A value of n represents a range of
                       'n-0.5' to 'n+0.499999'.

     ifConnectorPresent Set to true(1).

     ifAlias           The (non-volatile) alias name for this interface
                       as assigned by the network manager.

   Use of ifTable for OCh Layer See RFC 3591 [RFC3591] section 2.4

4.3.3.  Use of ifStackTable

   Use of the ifStackTable and ifInvStackTable to associate the
   opticalPhysicalSection and opticalChannel interface entries is best

   ops interface with ifIndex i that carries two multiplexed OCh
   interfaces with ifIndex values of j and k, respectively.  The example
   shows that j and k are stacked above (i.e., multiplexed into) i.
   Furthermore, it shows that there is no layer lower than i and no
   layer higher than j and/or k.

9.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o

   Some of the readable objects in this MIB module (i.e., objects with a
   MAX-ACCESS other than not-accessible) may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  It is thus important to
   control even GET and/or NOTIFY access to these objects and possibly
   to even encrypt the values of these objects when sending them over
   the network via SNMP.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

Internet-Draft  draft-galikunze-ccamp-g-698-2-snmp-mib-12      July 2015


   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

10.  IANA Considerations

   Option #1:

        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------

        sampleMIB  { mib-2 XXX }

   Option #2:

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.

   Note well: prior to official assignment by the IANA, an internet
   draft MUST use place holders (such as "XXX" above) rather than actual
   numbers.  See RFC4181 Section 4.5 for an example of how this is done
   in an internet draft MIB module.

   Option #3:

   This memo includes no request to IANA.
