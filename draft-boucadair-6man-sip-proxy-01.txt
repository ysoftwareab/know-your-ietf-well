                  IPv6 RA Option for SIP Proxy Server
                   draft-boucadair-6man-sip-proxy-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a new optional extension to IPv6 Router
   Advertisement messages to advertise SIP Proxy Server (e.g., P-CSCF)
   addresses to IPv6 hosts.

   The provisioning of the SIP Proxy Server address is crucial for the
   delivery of SIP-based services.  Means to ensure reliable delivery of
   this information to connecting SIP User Agents is a must.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",

   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

Internet-Draft           RA for SIP Proxy Server            October 2012


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Needs

   Access to SIP-based service offerings (e.g., telephony) relies on the
   provisioning of the IP address or FQDN of the outbound SIP Proxy
   Server [RFC3261].  Two means have been defined in the past to
   provision such information:

   1.  DHCPv6 SIP options [RFC3319].

   2.  Dedicated 3GPP PCO to convey the address of the P-CSCF [CORE].

   Nevertheless, these means are not sufficient because of the following
   reasons:

   1.  PCO-IE is not mandatory in 3G networks (e.g., PCO information may
       not be supported by terminals);

   2.  DHCPv6 is not required in all 3GPP releases.  Moreover, the
       support of DHCPv6 client is not mandatory in the IETF IPv6 node
       requirements.

   3.  PCO-IE is not available in non-3GPP networks.  This is very
       critical when the UE (User Equipment) performs a network
       attachment in a non-3GPP network because the user won't have
       access to SIP-based services if no alternative means are
       supported.

   As a conclusion, auto-configuration [RFC4861] is required so that a
   SIP UA (User Agent) can learn one or multiple SIP Proxy Servers.

1.2.  Scope

   This document defines a new ND option called SIP Proxy Server option
   that contains the domain name of SIP Proxy Server(s).  This option
   follows the procedures defined in [RFC4861].  The IPv6 host embedding
   a SIP UA can learn a list of SIP Proxy Servers using this option.

   This option can be sent along with other options, such as DNS
   information [RFC6106], in the same RA message.

   The router sending the SIP Proxy Server in RA must be configured with
   the Proxy Server information.

2.  SIP Proxy Server Option

   The SIP Proxy Server Option contains a domain name representing the
   SIP outbound Proxy Server (e.g., SBE, P-CSCF).  Figure 1 shows the
   format of the SIP Proxy Server Option.

        0                   1                   2                   3
        0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |     Type      |     Length    |           Reserved            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                           Lifetime                            |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
       |                                                               |
       :                    SIP Server Domain Name                     :
       |                                                               |
       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

                                 Figure 1

   Where

   o  Type: To be assigned (RA SIP Proxy Server Option).

   o  Length is a 8-bit unsigned integer.  The length of the option is
      in unit of 8 octets.

   o  Reserved is for future use.

   o  Lifetime is a 16-bit unsigned integer.  Same as in [RFC6106].

   o  SIP Server Domain Name: The domain names of the SIP outbound proxy
      servers for the client to use.  The domain names are encoded as
      specified Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].  The domain names MUST NOT be
      encoded in a compressed form, as described in Section 4.1.4 of
      [RFC1035].

   Upon receipt of an RA SIP Proxy Server option, the IPv6 host MUST
   verify that the option length does not exceed 255 octets [RFC1035].
   The IPv6 host MUST verify the FQDN is properly encoded as detailed in
   Section 3.1 of [RFC1035].

   Once the FQDN conveyed in a SIP Proxy Server RA option is validated,
   the included name is passed to the name resolution library (e.g.,
   Section 6.1.1 of [RFC1123] or [RFC6055]) to retrieve the
   corresponding IP address.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a new option code for:

      SIP Proxy Server


4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations discussed in [RFC4861] and [RFC3261] must
   be taken into account.

   This option can be used to inject a fake proxy server which will
   discover the security credentials used by legitimate user to connect
   to their SIP services.  This threat is similar to what is discussed
   in [RFC6106].
