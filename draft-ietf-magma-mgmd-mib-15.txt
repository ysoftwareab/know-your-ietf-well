1.  Introduction

   This memo defines a portion of the Management Information Base (MIB)
   for use with network management protocols in the Internet community.
   In particular, it describes objects used for managing the Internet
   Group Management Protocol (IGMP), version 1 [RFC1112], version 2
   [RFC2236] or version 3 [RFC3376] and the Multicast Listener Discovery
   (MLD) protocol version 1 [RFC2710] or version 2 [RFC3810].  Both
   protocols provide multicast membership discovery capability.  IGMP
   pertains to IP version 4 clients, and MLD for IP version 6 clients.
   This version of the MIB obsoletes both RFC 2933 [RFC2933] and RFC
   3019 [RFC3019], incorporating a generic interface for both IGMP and
   MLD implementations, and changes to enable "source filtering" in
   multicast clients.  The MIB encompasses both router and host nodes
   with relevant management objects defined for each.

2.  The Internet-Standard Management Framework

   For a detailed overview of the documents that describe the current
   Internet-Standard Management Framework, please refer to section 7 of
   RFC 3410 [RFC3410].

   Managed objects are accessed via a virtual information store, termed
   the Management Information Base or MIB.  MIB objects are generally
   accessed through the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
   Objects in the MIB are defined using the mechanisms defined in the
   Structure of Management Information (SMI).  This memo specifies a MIB
   module that is compliant to the SMIv2, which is described in STD 58,
   RFC 2578 [RFC2578], STD 58, RFC 2579 [RFC2579] and STD 58, RFC 2580
   [RFC2580].

3.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

4.  Overview

   This Multicast Group Membership Discovery (MGMD) MIB module contains
   eight tables:

   1.  the MGMD Host Interface Table which contains one row for each
       interface on which IGMP or MLD is enabled on a host,

   2.  the MGMD Router Interface Table which contains one row for each
       interface on which MGMD is enabled on a router,

Internet-Draft                  MGMD MIB                   February 2009


   3.  the MGMD Host Cache Table which contains one row for each IP
       multicast group for which there are members on a particular
       interface on a host,

   4.  the MGMD Router Cache Table which contains one row for each IP
       multicast group for which there are members on a particular
       interface on a router,

   5.  the reverse MGMD Host Table which contains one row for each
       interface for which there are active multicast groups on a host,

   6.  the reverse MGMD Router Table which contains one row for each
       interface for which there are active multicast groups on a
       router,

   7.  the MGMD HostSrcList Table which contains one row for each entry
       in the source filter record for an interface and multicast group
       pair on a host.

   8.  the MGMD RouterSrcList Table which contains one row for each
       entry in the source filter record for an interface and multicast
       group pair on a router.

   All tables are intended for EITHER router OR host functionality as
   indicated by the name and corresponding description, although it is
   anticipated that there would be scenarios where both terms might
   apply to a device, e.g. a router which joins a multicast group also
   as a host for measurement purposes.  The source list tables provide
   an extension to the cache tables to indicate the source specific
   includes or excludes associated with each IP Multicast group on each
   specific interface.  This functionality is only supported in IGMPv3
   and MLDv2 capable nodes.

   Incorporated within the MGMD MIB tables are objects for the
   management of IGMP and MLD proxy devices as described in RFC 4605
   [RFC4605].  Proxy devices can be used in simple topologies where it
   is not necessary to run a full multicast routing protocol.  A proxy
   device can make forwarding decisions based on IGMP or MLD group
   membership activity.

   The MIB references InterfaceIndex and InterfaceIndexOrZero objects as
   defined in RFC 2863 [RFC2863], the MIB which decribes generic objects
   for network interface sub-layers.

   Extensive references to the InetAddress and InetAddressType objects
   are made as defined in RFC 4001 [RFC4001].

6.  Security Considerations

   There are a number of management objects defined in this MIB module
   with a MAX-ACCESS clause of read-write and/or read-create.  Such
   objects may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  The support for SET operations in a non-secure
   environment without proper protection can have a negative effect on
   network operations.  These are the tables and objects and their
   sensitivity/vulnerability:

   o  The mgmdRouterInterfaceTable provides read-create access to 2
      values; the mgmdRouterInterfaceStatus and the
      mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryInterval.The mgmdRouterInterfaceStatus
      presents a remote user with the ability to enable or disable
      multicast support on a given router interface, and therefore
      presents a significant denial of service vulnerability.  The
      mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryInterval controls the frequency with which
      host-query packets are sent, providing less of a vulnerability,
      but still requiring secure access control.

   o  The mgmdRouterCacheTable also provides access to read-create
      objects.  The mgmdRouterInterfaceVersion controls the protocol
      conformance of an interface, and is therefore a potential denial
      of service vulnerability.  The

Internet-Draft                  MGMD MIB                   February 2009


      mgmdRouterInterfaceQueryMaxResponseTime, the
      mgmdRouterInterfaceRobustness and the
      mgmdRouterInterfaceLastMemberQueryInterval are all tuning
      parameters to control the characteristic of the host-query
      packets.  Compromise of these objects can potentially be
      disruptive to local multicast communication.

   o  The mgmdHostInterfaceTable provides a read-create object, the
      mgmdHostInterfaceVersion3Robustness, which controls the robustness
      of the interface to packet loss.  Disabling robustness in the face
      of packet loss could cause denial of service to hosts, however in
      general this presents a low risk.

   SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 did not include adequate security.
   Even if the network itself is secure (for example by using IPsec),
   even then, there is no control as to who on the secure network is
   allowed to access and GET/SET (read/change/create/delete) the objects
   in this MIB module.

   It is RECOMMENDED that implementers consider the security features as
   provided by the SNMPv3 framework (see [RFC3410], section 8),
   including full support for the SNMPv3 cryptographic mechanisms (for
   authentication and privacy).

   Further, deployment of SNMP versions prior to SNMPv3 is NOT
   RECOMMENDED.  Instead, it is RECOMMENDED to deploy SNMPv3 and to
   enable cryptographic security.  It is then a customer/operator
   responsibility to ensure that the SNMP entity giving access to an
   instance of this MIB module is properly configured to give access to
   the objects only to those principals (users) that have legitimate
   rights to indeed GET or SET (change/create/delete) them.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This MIB introduces a new term to refer to two existing multicast
   protocols, Multicast Group Membership Discovery.  It encompasses both
   the IPv4 Multicast discovery protocol, IGMP, and the IPv6 Multicast
   discovery protocol, MLD, as defined in RFCs 2933 [RFC2933] and 3019
   [RFC3019] respectively.

Internet-Draft                  MGMD MIB                   February 2009


        The MIB module in this document uses the following IANA-assigned
        OBJECT IDENTIFIER values recorded in the SMI Numbers registry:

        Descriptor        OBJECT IDENTIFIER value
        ----------        -----------------------
        mgmdStdMIB        { mib-2 XXX }

   Editor's Note (to be removed prior to publication): the IANA is
   requested to assign a value for "XXX" under the 'mib-2' subtree and
   to record the assignment in the SMI Numbers registry.  When the
   assignment has been made, the RFC Editor is asked to replace "XXX"
   (here and in the MIB module) with the assigned value and to remove
   this note.
